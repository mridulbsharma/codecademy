First of all, the only DD that there is going to be in this post is in the tag. All information  here comes from trust worthy sources: MCD graphs and my confirmation bias.

Mcdonalds is at the lowest point in the past year. If you check it's graph you will find an interesting pattern: several arches of 245$ to 300$.

Last earnings mcdonalds was expected to deliver 2.73 - 2.71 EPS, but only got 2.70. Obviously the stock has droped a 20% since then (lmao).

This is literally a train ticket to 300$ per share. Next earnings are in 2 weeks. If mcdonalds delivers their expections (duh) we can see a rebound from a 52W ATL by september / december. 

Huge value investing oportunity to just hold, or to play for earnings.

1dz8haj,2024-07-09 17:37:55,Event for Chinese Stocks: Third Plenum (July 15-18),"I didnt see anyone post on this, so I thought I would. The CCP holds an annual meeting called the Third Plenum were they go over economic issues and announce the party's most important policies. The whole party is there including Winnie the Poh. Chinese stocks have been decimated over the last two years with the Chinese consumer fearful to spend. The CCP hasn't introduced any sort of stimulus (that I know of), which has created a sort of confidence crisis. 

The Third Plenum is usually scheduled earlier in the year, but they postponed it to now. With Chinese stocks doing so poorly etc, I think CCP might surprise the market with some sort of stimulus that could propel Chinese stocks. If not, I don't think there's much downside because people arent expecting anything.

The bull case:
- Dominance in mobile market with full market share + demand for more compute + increasing royalties over license fees = money printer for arm 
- Huge potential in laptop market, as demonstrated by Apple M series and most recently with Qualcomm’s latest snapdragon laptop processor. They are already dethroning Intel and AMD, who will be left playing catch up because x86 is too far behind in power efficiency terms.
- Infrastructure: everyone (literally everyone) is shifting towards arm processors for datacenter workloads. Look for huge growth in market penetration here
- IoT, automotive etc: arm still dominates in these sectors, with better and more modern IP for new applications 
- AI: obviously closely tied to all these other areas as everyone desperately tries to slap AI in their products, the arm+Nvidia combo is the clear winner across all sectors in this space 

The bear case:
- RISCV: who cares? No one. Because it’s an open ISA, not a dedicated IP company will billions to spend on R&D to stay ahead of the curve
- AI hype: fair
- overpriced: maybe, consider consistent revenue premium from their unique business model and huge growth opportunities 
- intel and amd catching up: these guys are in the dust mucking around with x86, arm is focussing on specific markets where their IP has considerable advantages

**Property Fraud Allegations Snowball as Commercial Real-Estate Values Fall**

>U.S. prosecutors are cracking down on commercial mortgage fraud, a growing push that is sending shudders through the $4.7 trillion industry by raising questions about the numbers underpinning major property loans.

>Regulators and federal prosecutors say that property loans based on doctored building financials and valuations have been rising. This type of fraud became more widespread between the mid-2010s and 2021, federal investigators and real-estate brokers say, when commercial property prices surged to new highs and landlords had much to gain from such maneuvers. 

>Now, the drop in property values caused by higher interest rates and a rise in defaults are exposing more of these schemes, dealing another blow to a commercial real-estate market suffering through its worst stretch since the 2008-09 financial crisis. 

>“It’s a general trend throughout history that fraud occurs during boom times and is revealed during bust times,” said John Griffin, a professor of finance at the University of Texas’ McCombs School of Business.

>In most cases, real-estate fraud is made possible because lenders take a hands-off approach to assessing a building’s value. As long as the numbers look in line with those of similar properties, lenders usually trust that they are accurate, brokers say. Auditing books is expensive and time consuming, and lenders competing for deals may be reluctant to antagonize landlords with onerous due diligence. ... ...  
  
Since last fall, at least five different landlords of properties, mostly apartment buildings, in cities including Cincinnati, Hartford, Conn., and Little Rock, Ark., have pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges. Some allegedly doctored building income statements, others allegedly faked property sales at inflated prices, all to get bigger loans.",257,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dyr84y/the_penny_drops_on_commercial_real_estate/,wallstreetbets

VF Corp. which oversees multiple popular retail brands in the likes of Vans, Northface, Supreme etc has been in freefall due to the incompetence of previous management, but the turnaround process has started and the moves they are making remind me a lot of another retail giant in Abercrombie and Fitch.

The success of any retail clothing company hinges on the demand for their products, and VF recently poached one of the best in the game from Lululemon in Sun Choe. This hire gives me the most confidence in the direction of the brand from a style and demand perspective.

One of the biggest concerns analysts have had with $VFC has been the debt on the balance sheet, which is also about to be eliminated in a big way. At Q1 earnings, VF announced they have completed their strategic portfolio review and have now hired Goldman Sachs to oversee the sale of one of their brands. Everyone in the industry suspects this to be Supreme, which is going to command a good price and take A LOT of stress off the balance sheet. A sale announcement at Q2 earnings call could absolutely rocket the stock.

Insiders at the company know the turnaround is coming: top executives continue to buy up the stock and nobody from within is selling. Today, volume is significantly down from where it’s been while the price is charging. In a downtrend this tells me one thing: the sellers are gone, and we’re about to start moving.",23,0.79,https://i.redd.it/gqicagqtydbd1.jpeg,wallstreetbets

1dymsup,2024-07-08 22:56:12,Why a Lucid Air Sapphire for James Bond?,"1.	Innovative Technology: The Lucid Air Sapphire represents the latest in electric vehicle technology with impressive performance and range, making it ideal for the high-tech world of James Bond.
	2.	Environmental Awareness: In an era where sustainability is becoming increasingly important, Bond using an electric vehicle could set a sign for environmental consciousness.
	3.	Design and Aesthetics: The Lucid Air Sapphire has a sleek, modern design that fits well with the sophisticated and stylish image that Bond fans expect from 007.
	4.	Performance: With its extreme acceleration and speed, the Sapphire would be perfect for the spectacular chase scenes and evasive maneuvers that are standard in Bond films.

Marketing Potential

Such placement would not only prominently highlight the Lucid brand to a global audience but also strengthen the image of the electric vehicle in general. Associating with a cultural icon like James Bond could help position electric vehicles as desirable, powerful, and technologically advanced options in the automobile market.

Implementation

For successful integration, Lucid Motors might need to collaborate with the film producers to ensure the vehicle is authentically embedded in the plot and its unique features are used sensibly. Additionally, a marketing campaign around the film’s release could maximize the effect, similar to how other car brands have done with their Bond cars in the past.

Overall, featuring a Lucid Air Sapphire in a James Bond film could be an exciting opportunity for Lucid to showcase its brand on the global market while also reinforcing the image of electric vehicles as the cars of the future.",0,0.4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dymsup/why_a_lucid_air_sapphire_for_james_bond/,wallstreetbets
1dylq15,2024-07-08 22:10:29,"MSFT and AAPL are overvalued and overbought, Wallstreet is expecting too much from AI.","I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.

If chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.

Now for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. You're paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.

MSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.

AAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.

That fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.

I agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it.

The markets today reacted slightly positively on the Boeing plea deal announcement but for most people Boeing accepting it was obvious.

I think the real point to focus on here is whether Boeing will be able to get access to government contracts or not. Most people who are bearish after the plea deal news are probably thinking about the government contracts. These contracts make up 37% of Boeing’s sales and government approval generally provides confidence to private customers. What do you guys think?

The possibility seems unsure but legal precedent leans in the restoration of government contracts access.

Personally I think the government will continue to be forgiving towards Boeing, although they are likely to receive more public backlash (maybe a judge might step in too). 

Note that the government might not end up choosing Boeing for these contracts but I don’t think that detail matters as much for the bulk of investors.",17,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dyjnw2/thoughts_on_if_boeing_will_keep_defense_contracts/,wallstreetbets

There are 98 Million CORZW outstanding. Any warrant holder, at any time, can exercise this warrant by submitting it to the company, paying the $6.81 strike price, and get 1 share of CORZ. But if you do the math, the $5.05 warrant price, plus the $6.81 strike price is $11.86, which is much higher than the $10.29 price of CORZ. If you like money, you wouldn't exercise your warrant, you would just sell the warrant to someone else. The warrants are a 2.5 year option and have a lot of time value (premium) in them. Over the next 3 years, the tranche 1 warrants has potential to provide proceeds of $670M, which can be used to pay down secured notes, equipment-backed debt, and remaining other debt allowing the company to be debt free (Remaining debt 348m) So for simplicity purposes, we are going to look at market cap fully diluted. 



The company has 82 Million warrants that can be exercised by the warrant holder at $0.01 per share. They can only be exercised after the stock has a VWAP greater than $8.72 for 20 consecutive trading days. As of 7/5 we're at 16 days, making Thursday 7/12 the likely date that this trigger is met (provided we don't fall below 8.72 any day on a VWAP basis). 

CORZ has $260M of Convertible notes (bonds). The trigger for conversion was met on Friday(7/5). All of the people holding these securities will be forced to exchange them for shares which will wipe $260M of debt off of CORZ's balance sheet. Simultaneously, the company will issue 44.58M shares of stock to the noteholders.



500 MW HPC Hosting (Best out of the bitcoin miners, been building since 2019)

The datacenter industry is changing, and according to the Uptime Institute, datacenters today operate at 6 KW/rack, and CORZ is able to deliver 100 KW/rack for Blackwell GPU architecture with liquid cooling, with eventual generations of GPUs needing > 200 KW/rack overtime that operators like CORZ are able to deliver, in addition to having > 100 Gb/s Ethernet in proximity to growing datacenter markets such as Dallas and Atlanta. 

  


First 200 MW HPC Sold to Coreweave for 12 years for 2.5Bil profit

Next 70 HW HPC  (6/25),  Coreweave exercised its first option for delivery of additional 70MW of infrastructure to host NVDA GPUs for HPC with site

modifications expected to begin in 2H24 and operational status anticipated in 2H25. The contract

is at similar economics to first 200MW agreement with revenues of $1.45M/MW, adding additional

$1.225B in cumulative revenue over the 12-year contract.

3.5Bil over 12 years, (power costs pass to coreweave), (possible 5 year extensions). 



 (Datacenter REITS with monolithic tier digital infrastructure and already booked MW capacity for AI/HPC trade at > 20x EBITDA).







**230 MW Remaining.**

However, if we take a look at what Coreweave stands to gain using some simple assumptions: 

- **200 megawatts** leased 

- **H100s** require consume **700 watts**

- **200 megawatts** of energy can accommodate approximate **285,000 H100s** (200 megawatts \* 100000 watts per megawatt / 700 watts)

- let's be conservative and say 200 megawatts can accommodate **200,000 H100s**

- Fronting the cost of 200,000 H100s, each GPU around $30,000 \*will be **6 billion dollars** 

- Assuming a lifespan of 3 years for these GPU's, and assuming that after every 3 years, they are replaced with new GPUs, this means the total cost of GPU's over a 12 year period will be **24 billion** (without doing any discounting)

- Upfront cost of **Tier 3 Data Centers** is around $23,000 per killowatt, for 200 MW, this means around **4.6 billion**

- Adding all of the costs up **28.6 billion** 

- Coreweave currently charges around (4.25 - 4.76) for H100 variants, so assuming $4.50 per hour of GPU, this leads to around **5.76 billion** per year

- after discounting, using **10% interest rate and 0.7 utilization rate** of the GPU's, for a 12 year period the total revenue comes out to around **34.58 billion**

- subtracting this from the total cost of **28.6 billion**, this means that Coreweave, conservatively,  stands to earn  **5.89 billion** 



What this means is that Core Scientific, if they were to follow an asset-heavy model and pursue their own clients instead of leasing to Coreweave, could stand to have **5.89 billion** of profits instead of the **2.5 billion** it received from the Coreweave for **200 megawatts**.



But assuming they go asset light again, of all the miners they are primed to receive the next HPC deal, given they have already done a deal with an NVDA backed company and they have the best infrastructure and can deliver sooner than other miners. If they choose to lease out the remaining 230 MPW for similar deals, say in a leasing structure, another 2.5 bil would not be outside the realm of possibility. bringing total profits up to 6b over 12 years for 4b.  If they manage to get even better deals for the remaining 230 MW, then the stock could rerate by billions quickly. It is basically an AI utility company with a Bitcoin mining segment attached as a call option.

  


From Compass Point Research

BTC Mining/MW Breakdown: CORZ released their May production update (see here ), and mined 447 BTC at implied \~90% uptime of its 20.4 EH/s of self-mining installed capacity. Based on the recent production report, CORZ fleet efficiency surprised to the upside at 24 J/Th (489 MW of power) and we see potential for better hosting margins (\~115MW assuming 50/50 S19XPs and S21s). We expect CORZ to look to curtail operations and lock in lower power prices in an effort to maximize profitability post-halving. Starting in 3Q24 as CORZ transitions machines away from HPC sites, we expect operating hash rate of \~15.5 EH/s in 3Q23, and \~16.5 EH/s in 4Q24, before further improving to \~18.5 EH/s in CY25. The company expects to see minimal disruption of mining business during HPC transition with ability to move machines to other site (likely West Texas) and build out of partially built infrastructure (\~796MW currently operating, full potential of \~1.1-2GW), which we are modeling capex to build 300MW of capacity during CY24-25. Overall we continue to believe CORZ mining business is in a good position post halving with < $0.04 hash costs, and we continue to expect operating leverage from higher BTC/Hash prices 2H24/2025 (hash price reached \~9.5c last weekend from elevated transaction fees).



 

These are the estimated returns on bitcoin mining by compass research. Slap whatever multiple you want on that to get your upside. 

2025 Adj. Mining EBITDA $ 251

2025 Adj. BTC Hosting EBITDA $ 11

1dyca8a,2024-07-08 15:51:21,My way of investing… Keep 50% cash on hand during the Fall/Winter.,"I like to make money trading stocks. The United States is founded on Judeo-Christian values whether you like it or not. The last three recessions have started in the Fall/Winter (since the early 2000’s). I know using seasons to predict the stock market might seem stupid but just vibe with me here for a second. I have a feeling that the next recession will start in the Fall or Winter because life tends to die off in during those times plus a lot of other reasons. Then I invest all of my money during the Spring and Summer months, only picking a few high conviction stocks to bring  my ROI up to above average returns. Then when Fall comes along I sell most of my positions to bring me back to 50% cash on hand - rinse and repeat. I don’t think there is any right way of calculating the bottom of a recession. Timing the market can be stressful and infuriating but if I know when the recession will happen I think I will have enough will power to not invest because bad news travels faster than good news.

I bought into $BRKb a couple of years ago. As you can see I'm quite happy with the 122% gain over this period. But what am I supposed to do with it now to actually get any benefit out of this share? They don't pay dividend so I'm not getting any yield on my investments. They pretty much never do a stock split so it's not like my number of shares can grow. Obviously I can sell it and cash out the gain, but isn't BRK generally treated as a ""buy don't trade"" stock. Price very seldom goes down, so it isn't likely I can sell now and buy at the dip, so if I sell it then it's unlikely I buy back in, I'd just be losing the difference doing that.

So what do people do with BRK? Do they just sit on it forever until one day they need the cash and are liquidating their portfolio. Do people trade in and out of BRK or just buy and hold? I'd like to redeploy that capital in something with a bigger growth story potential, but I want to stay in BRK also.",9,0.67,https://i.redd.it/77iqexojfbbd1.jpeg,wallstreetbets

1dybq8k,2024-07-08 15:27:47,Going All-In on NYCB,"I have been following NYCB for some time now. Steve Mnuchin's involvement in the stock is what initially piqued my interest. Why would someone with his level of Wall Street experience jump into a bank that is headed for bankruptcy? An intriguing question.

I think now might be the time to jump back into the stock for a few reasons: 

-**Reverse stock split on 7/11**: This has no impact on the value of the stock, yada yada. I get it. But, in a situation where NYCB is fighting market psychology, this could be bullish if it can change the narrative from a failing bank on the brink of bankruptcy to a resilient turnaround story. It's all window dressing, but that may still be valuable. 

-**Upcoming earnings**: NYCB will be announcing earnings on 7/25. Between 1Q earnings and now, NYCB completed an asset sale to JPM (https://ir.mynycb.com/files/doc\_financials/2024/q1/NYCB-1Q-2024-Earnings-Earnings-Presentation-5-1-2024.pdf). NYCB trades at a price-to-TBV of less than .5, well below its competitors. It's priced as if there is still a significant risk of bankruptcy despite the JPM asset sale improving its liquidity metrics across the board (CETI1, cash-to-assets, loan-to-deposit ratio, etc.). If they can demonstrate balance sheet stabilization and deliver an earnings beat, I think there is the potential for a large post-earnings bump. 

-**Improving odds of a September rate cut**: It is no secret that rising interest rates have been a large issue for regional banks. A September rate cut would help NYCB (and the other regional banks) dig out of the hole that they are currently in. The entire industry is (likely) going to be headed in the right direction over the next six to nine months. 

-**Political tailwinds:** Everyone watched the debate last week. Trump is now the odds on favorite to be the next President of the United States. Even if he does not directly intervene, Trump's association with New York real estate and Mnuchin is likely to be perceived as a tailwind for this stock. 

-**Strong management team**: Mnuchin and Joe Otting know what they are doing. They've run this playbook before with OneWest. They are both incredibly well-connected in the financial industry and have decades of experience in the financial services industry. They know more than us about this bank. And they chose to invest. I trust their judgement. To believe NYCB's credit quality issues are going to continue, you have to believe that someone as savvy as Mnuchin made an extremely bad bet. 

TLDR: Improving macroeconomic backdrop for regional banks, political connections with the (potential) Trump administration, strengthening balance sheet, veteran leadership team.

1dy9if8,2024-07-08 13:54:29,Delta DAL Stock Will Be Flying High,"# DELTA DAL Stock Fundamental Analysis

RATING: BUY

PRICE TARGET: $50.63

UPSIDE: 10.0%

The US Economy continues to demonstrate resilience. A leisure stock like Carnival Cruise Line posted great Q2 results and guidance with “strong booking momentum, with record volumes for 2025 sailing.” ([Carnival Stock Breaks Out As '25 Bookings Already Top Full Year '24 | Investor's Business Daily (investors.com)](https://www.investors.com/news/carnival-cruise-q2-earnings/)) What's another stock for leisure? Airlines.

# Why did CCL Stock Rise After Q2 Earnings?

1. Record Financial Performance:

Record Revenues: Carnival reported record second-quarter revenues of $5.8 billion.

Operating Income: Achieved record operating income of $560 million, nearly five times the 2023 levels.

Net Income: Significant improvement in net income, nearly $500 million higher than 2023, with adjusted net income outperforming March guidance by nearly $170 million.

2. Increased Guidance:

Full Year 2024 Guidance Raised: Carnival raised its full-year net yield guidance to approximately 10.25% and increased full-year adjusted net income guidance by approximately $275 million due to continued strong demand.

Positive Outlook for 2025: Early bookings for 2025 were even higher than 2024 in both price and occupancy, indicating strong future demand.

3. Strong Demand and Bookings:

Record Customer Deposits: Customer deposits reached an all-time high of $8.3 billion, surpassing the previous record by $1.1 billion.

High Occupancy and Prices: The cumulative booked position for the remainder of 2024 was the best on record, with occupancy and prices significantly higher than the previous year.

4. Operational Efficiency and Strategic Moves:

Cost Management: Adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per available lower berth day (ALBD) were better than prior year and March guidance due to cost savings and timing of expenses.

Strategic Portfolio Optimization: The decision to sunset the P&O Cruises (Australia) brand and fold its operations into Carnival Cruise Line, along with other strategic reallocations, aimed to optimize the company's brand portfolio and enhance performance.

5. Capital Management and Refinancing:

Debt Management: Carnival continued its efforts to manage its debt profile by prepaying $1.6 billion of its senior secured term loans and repricing other loan facilities. These actions are expected to save significant interest expenses over time and reduce net interest expense by $55 million in 2024.

Strong Liquidity: The company ended the quarter with $4.6 billion of liquidity.

These positive financial results, along with the raised guidance and strong future outlook, likely contributed to the surge in Carnival's stock price.

# What Happened in DAL Q1 2024

**Positive News from Delta Airlines' Q1 2024 Earnings Report**

1. Strong Operational Performance: Delta achieved industry-leading operational performance with record March quarter completion factors and on-time performance.
2. Financial Metrics:

Record Revenue: Operating revenue of $13.7 billion and adjusted operating revenue of $12.6 billion, up 6% from Q1 2023.

Earnings and Cash Flow: Adjusted EPS of $0.45 and operating cash flow of $2.5 billion.

Positive Outlook: Strong guidance for Q2 2024 with expected record revenue, operating margin of 14-15%, and EPS of $2.20 to $2.50.

Full-Year 2024 Guidance: Expected EPS of $6 to $7 and free cash flow of $3 to $4 billion.

3. Corporate and Domestic Travel Demand:

Corporate sales grew by 14% year-over-year, driven by the return of large corporate accounts.

Domestic unit revenues were a record for the March quarter, with a 3% year-over-year growth.

4. International Travel:

International passenger revenue was 12% higher than Q1 2023.

5. Revenue Diversification:

Diversified revenue streams, including loyalty programs and premium services, continued to grow.

6. Employee Engagement:

$1.4 billion in profit-sharing payouts, celebrating Delta employees' contributions to operational excellence.

 

**Negative News from Delta Airlines' Q1 2024 Earnings Report**

1. Cost Performance:

Operating expense of $13.1 billion and adjusted operating expense of $11.9 billion.

Adjusted non-fuel costs increased by 1.5% year-over-year.

2. Debt Levels:

Total debt and finance lease obligations were $19.4 billion at the end of the quarter.

Adjusted net debt of $20.2 billion at the end of the quarter, though reduced from the previous year.

3. Mixed Revenue Environment:

Total unit revenue (TRASM) was down 0.7% year-over-year.

Headwinds from Cargo and MRO impacted revenue growth.

4. Non-fuel Cost Increases:

Non-fuel unit costs are expected to increase by approximately 2% in Q2 2024 and remain at low single-digit growth for the full year.

The stock's initial jump could be attributed to the strong revenue, operational performance, and positive outlook. The subsequent drop might have been influenced by concerns over rising costs, debt levels, and mixed revenue environment. The stock's rebound in the following month likely reflects investor confidence in Delta's long-term guidance and operational improvements.

**Delta Guidance in Q1 2024 Report**

**For Q2 2024:**

Total Revenue YoY: Up 5% - 7%

Operating Margin: 14% - 15%

Earnings Per Share (EPS): $2.20 - $2.50

**For FY 2024:**

Earnings Per Share (EPS): $6 - $7

Free Cash Flow: $3 - $4 billion

Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR: 2x - 3x.

# Here’s Where Its Interesting

Free cash flow is king. The FCF in 2019 was 3.4B. Delta’s guidance for FCF for 2024 is 3B to 4B. However, the market cap back in 2019 was $37.6B while the current market cap is around 30B. That means Delta still has 7B room for growth in this apples-to-apples scenario.

Let’s assume the lower end of the FCF guidance at 3B. Using the market cap of 2019 as a reference point, the expected market cap in 2024 would be 32.4B which means DAL could go to $50.63 which is an upside of 10% or a gain of $4.61 per share.

# Market Cap and Free Cash Flow

|DATE|12/31/2019|12/31/2024|
|:-|:-|:-|
|FCF|3.489B|3B|
|Mkt Cap|37,681B|30,142B|
|P/FCF|10.80|10.05|

# Price Prediction Using FCF Guidance

|If 2024 FCF is|3B|
|:-|:-|
|Then the expected Mkt Cap is|$32.4B|
|Therefore, the expected DAL Stock Price is|$50.63|
|DAL Current Price|$46.02|
|**Upside $**|**+$4.61**|
|**Upside $**|**10.0%**|

**Potential Risks**

1. Comparing Delta's 2019 market cap and FCF to today 2024 may not be appropriate. Crude oil was cheaper, and interest rates were lower back in 2019. Crude Oil per barrel was around $59 compared to today at $82. Highest Fed Funds rate in 2019 was 2.42% compared to 5.33% today.
2. The Free Cash Flow guidance is currently $3B - $4B for 2024. Guidance may need to be upgraded in Q2 earnings to continue the stock momentum. Travel trends could be underwhelming [DAL 46.02 ▼ −2.89% Unnamed (tradingview.com)](https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20240705004989:0/)

1dy742b,2024-07-08 12:00:07,My DD on Sirius Xm ,"     First off, let's talk about the elephant in the room - the stock price. SIRI has been beaten down like a piñata at a kid's birthday party. We're talking about a stock that's down more than 60% from its 2018 peak and is still within sight of the 12-year low reached earlier this month.
     Now, let's talk about the business itself. Sirius XM is the result of the 2008 merger of satellite radio outfits Sirius and XM, which combined their collective reach into a single dominant name at a time when internet-based alternatives were starting to get real traction. The company has a strong track record of profitability, with 10-figure annual free cash flow for years now. With a 44% lower share count compared to 2012, the company is like a well-oiled machine, chugging along with efficiency and precision.
     Wait, there's more! The stock's prolonged weakness has led to another compelling outcome - it's inflated the dividend yield. With a forward-looking dividend yield of 4.1%, SIRI is like a cosmic cash cow, ready to shower you with riches from the heavens. With only about one-third of its earnings dished out to shareholders in the form of dividends, there's plenty of wiggle room for growth. It's like having a money tree that not only grows but also pays you to watch it grow! Not to mention the over 2 billion in revenue combined with over 1 billion in tangible assets! (maybe this is why Warren Buffett keeps investing in Sirius?) 
      What about the competition you ask? Well, contrary to a common assumption, Sirius XM isn't doomed due to the advent of more convenient alternative forms of audio entertainment. The company has been making strategic moves to stay relevant in the ever-evolving media landscape. For example, they recently launched Unified ID 2.0, allowing their ad-supported programming's advertisers to more precisely target customers in an environment that's obscuring web users' unique digital footprints. It's like having a secret weapon to navigate the treacherous waters of the digital universe!
Also let's not forget about the star power. Sirius XM recognizes the importance of being able to leverage the exclusivity of its on-air celebrities like Howard Stern. 
     So, should I buy shares and call options on SIRI? Well, i like a stock that's been beaten down to a pulp but still has the potential for orbital comeback.

1dxzd9g,2024-07-08 03:51:41,You only truly lose when you stop trying…..I’m not done trying!,"I lost $25,440 from November 2023 - March 2024 trading like a monkey on tilt pressing buttons for the most part with some good trades in between. My mental game was my biggest problem. All my winning days turned into losers due to revenge trading, greed, and impulses.

 Now I didn’t deposit 25k and ran it to zero, I would deposit a couple thousand above 25k to day trade following pdt and deposit more when my account dropped below 25k. In March my account dropped below 25k again and I had no way to bring it back to 25k so I quit trading everyday for 4 months to regroup and make some money outside of the market with my real job and split my account into a few small accounts to trade here and there following pdt.

During this time, I made 35k from my real job and also 1k from trading small accounts. This had led me to have confidence and capital to combine my small accounts back and deposit 27k into we bull again to fully day trade again since July 1st.

This time feels different. I am controlling my emotions better and results are better than before. Currently I’m up $1178  after my deposit.

 I feel like this could be the biggest turning point of my trading career or the end of it. And I think I will find out by the end of this month. I will update in a month if anyone is interested. Enjoy the lost porn!

To address some questions

1. Why your dad did not buy Nvidia 6 months ago?
He has invested all his money on real-estate at that time

2. Can you remind me later? 
Yes, I will! Hopefully, he makes some out of it! 

3. Top?
Yeah, I agree you all! Hopefully, he does not sell Nvidia next 3 years!

1dxyxdh,2024-07-08 03:27:59,"NFE - LNG/utility stock trading just above fresh 52wk L, 9x E, 6x Fwd E, 1.54x FFO for next 18 months","Anyone familiar with NFE has become accustomed to missed deadlines and seemingly endless delays surrounding their Altamira, MX offshore LNG export facility. First estimated to be online 12 months ago and now having missed 4 other self imposed deadlines the market has clearly lost its patience which is why the stock has dropped from $29.11 to $19.4 in the last 36 trading sessions. But as the saying goes: buy low, sell high. NFE has traded between $19 - $63 since August 2021. 

https://preview.redd.it/llympyzvn7bd1.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9e9c60e80b05a190d9ebc0ed90ce861a3be605f

At this very moment NFE / Altamira are closer to going live than ever and yet the stock trades for a pittance versus trailing earnings, forward E, and management's FFO guidance. Cheniere Energy (LNG) which operates the Freeport LNG export site trades for 16x forward E, nearly 3x more than NFE currently. A recent (6/21) note by an analyst at Stifel set a $40 PT (outperform rating) with expectations of $1.4B & $2B EBITDA for 2024 & 2025 while NFE's EV sits around $11.8B. Markets rarely offer utility-like cash flows such as NFE's for this cheap. 

Meanwhile shorts continue to push the stock lower on a near daily basis with short interest at a record high, likely surpassing 18m shares shorted as of now. 205m shares outstanding. Billionaire CEO/Founder Wes Edens controls 36% and has never taken any wage while running NFE since creating it a decade ago. Other insiders hold 12%. Institutional ownership controls 48-52%. Yes, that's 98%-100% of all shares. I don't think there's more than 4-6m shares worth of supply below $25 at the moment. Fundamentally the stock is beyond dirt cheap here, shorts are crowded (short ratio sits at over 10.00 now), and there should be positive news flow and a very positive reaction for the stock once Altamira loads its first LNG cargo in the next few days. Next catalyst after that will be earnings on 8/7. I expect management to provide strong guidance for the final two quarters as well as 2025 and beyond. 

Once the stock closes back above $22.50 I expect it to rally rapidly back towards $25-27 before retesting and reclaiming the 50DMA around $30-31. The Board of Directors has previously discussed and considered a share buyback while the stock was above $30. The CEO has seen his net worth take a \~$770m hit since Q1 ER due to fears of another delay for Altamira. Even if I tried, I don't think I could come up with a better scenario: a severely undervalued stock, with a billionaire insider/founder holding such a large stake, ahead of multiple positive catalysts, with the highest level of shorts ever, in an industry like this with near endless demand for cheap North American sourced LNG.

Given this setup I wouldn't be surprised if the stock is back above $40 before September. BoD aim to increase the dividend once the balance sheet is deleveraged further with a target of at least 40% of FCF. Based on 2025's $6-7 FFO, that leaves the future potential dividend yield at 12-15% now.

Their business model is being hammered with high interest rates and inflation.  Whisper is that revenues are down over 20% from YOY 2023 and with 400 locations that’s going to be a lot of punishment. Their holdover costs of inventory as well as slim margins will hammer any profits. Stock is trading around 300 and short options are cheap creating the perfect scenario for a large drop in share price possibly 30% or more. Just look at how the street punishes a slight miss recently on MU and see what happened to NKE when they released last week with a miss and lowered guidance for the rest of 2024 and 2025. Besides lots of big banks and hedge funds are stuck with costs of closer to 400 per share. Let’s take this viral and punish the big boys and get rich while doing so. Share and spread the word!

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/YKUlHYLOOj

To all the people who are concerned about me, I’m honestly doing alright now, thanks I appreciate your concern. I paid back that margin owed over the past few years and I have put this chapter behind me. It really sucked and I sincerely wish no one ever goes through something like this. 

But most of you asked if I had any lessons learned from my trading debacle. These are my personal thoughts and you can agree or disagree, I do not care.

NO there is no TL;DR.

1. Only invest the amount you’re okay losing or the amount you won’t be needing for the next 2-3 years

2. Do not trade options unless you really understand it well, or unless you want to simply gamble. Learn about the Greeks, and IV CRUSH AROUND EARNINGS. Buying both sides of the trade is no guarantee you’ll make money.

3. Always take gains (small consistent gains are better than chasing 10 baggers in the long run)

4. Cut your losers early (do not average down like a regard)

5. Being an options seller is somewhat better in the long run

6. Long term mindset is the way to go

7. There’s always another play

8. No shame in quitting trading if you are not doing well

9. Never enable margin trading. Trade with your own cash (and limit that cash to point 1)

10. You can hunt for value plays, but there are certain value plays that can make or break your portfolio. Mine broke my portfolio 

11. Do not chase a hype train, unless you really believe it’s the next best thing in the world

12. NEVER look back and see what a trade you have already exited would’ve been, this one thing will mess with all your future trades. If you’ve exited, just move on, don’t keep tracking it thinking it would’ve netted you another 100% or so

I will edit the post to add more points if I remember them.

1dxlz3o,2024-07-07 17:33:10,[DD] Invest in Cyberpunk Dystopia with Electric Quadcopters. Urban Air Mobility Sector set to take off.,"edit: in case my dystopian joke opening was toooo pithy, the rest of the post does have a serious thesis.

A review of near-future science fiction media (Westworld, Bladerunner, Cyberpunk 2077, etc) reveals that electric VTOL aircraft capable of maneuvering and landing in tight urban airspaces will be in great demand and common use for corporate overlords and quasi-fascist law enforcement organizations. Fortunately, these aircraft actually exist! Now is the time to invest in them to be oligarchs instead of serfs in our future dystopia!

Electric Vertical Aircraft (eVTOL) is a speculative tech sector that is gaining momentum for an explosive breakout. I suspect it will soon follow a pattern like satellite comms (ASTS, GSAT), AI, Fintech, Cloud everything, Cybersecurity, and EVs, with extreme valuation fluctuations as companies push from speculative to operational, and some “winners” emerging by 2026 with sustained major value increases.

Human-piloted and fully AI-piloted eVTOLs will land at “vertiports” in cities, on airport, skyscraper, and resort helipads, and rapidly deploy QRFs to quell rebels dissenting against corporate feudalism. eVTOLs aim to greatly expand the use of “Air Taxis” and regional/urban air transport options for small cargo, people, and other tasks.

*Disclaimer: obviously, I might be an idiot since I post here, so consider that before buying anything based on this analysis. Also I wrote this before seeing someone else posted about this today.*

*Also, I'm using ""EVTOL"" here to avoid the Electric Vertical Aircraft acronym from triggering as a banned ticker.*

&nbsp;

**BLUF: Main Thesis**

*The eVTOL and particularly the UAM sector is primed to be re-valued from high-risk speculation to operational, revenue generating business. Valuations currently depressed by fear due to significant schedule uncertainty and technology questions will rise rapidly into speculative hype as clear timelines emerge and probability of successful operations increases.*

* While eVTOL future is uncertain, options gamblers should love this as a month-long play with high potential to break out, even if we see retracing afterwards.

* Multiple companies spiked on announcements last summer, but retraced as dilution and timeline risk re-emerged.

* This summer, companies have provided more concrete timelines and test successes, and announced an end to dilution as they have cash or revenue to sustain until full operations.

* Getting in now will front-run the overall sector value increase as risk-averse investors become willing to buy. In the short term, continued milestone achievements will bring immediate hype (10-baggers?) through summer ERs and EOY, and set the stage for sustainable operations over the next 2-3 years.

* Segment analysis has CAGR between 25-50% from now through the next decade, depending on the exact parameters and time of analysis.

* EVTOLs are marketed as ""green"" aviation and may become part of the push away from fossil fuels as battery and engine efficiency continues to increase.

* Hype-wise, financial and general articles about the segment have ramped up considerably over the last month. Getting in now will also front run my suspicion that one or more eVTOL startups will go on a ""meme"" run before the end of summer. 

* AI-piloted eVTOL are unlikely to run you into highway barriers at full speed, unlike FSD, as there are fewer things to hit in the sky.

* This post is already long AF and I cut out a ton of supporting research and ticker-specific analysis so I could meme about dystopias and autopilot. Will post more details and information on request.

&nbsp;

**BLUF: Archer Aviation ($ACHR) calls are the “I can’t read, what do I buy” play**

Yeah you’re not here for a sector DD, don’t care about buying shares of multiple companies, wen lambo?!…

**If you want to pick one gambling play, I would go with ACHR 4.5 or 5c, expiry 8/15 (extreme risk due to thin volume) or 10/18 (better volume).** ACHR closed at ~$4.4 on Friday, up from $3.46 on Monday. Next ER is 8/8.

Archer is on a major upswing, trading higher on about double its average volume over the last week. They’ve announced they have sufficient cash to achieve FAA Type certification for their “Midnight” airframe *(no more dilution!),* have other relevant certs in place, and confirmed their first market is rich San Francisco. Last summer ACHR went to $7.22/share before retracing on uncertain certification timeline and cash risks, issues which are now resolved. Market size, concrete business plans, an outrageously large OI of more than 100,000 calls for 10/18 5c, and current trajectory mimicking last summer suggest a return to at least that level soon. As a previous SPAC, early ~~investors~~ bagholders (me lol) get ROI at a price above $10/share and PT average is $8.1, so institutions and major holders shouldn’t begin profit-taking until those marks. I don’t think short interest is relevant but FWIW if it helps you hype yourself up, it's quite high at 26% of float, due to the high risk speculative nature of the company.

As with all plays that cover an ER, I would **strongly** consider selling or at least rolling up to extract profits pre-ER if the price continues to rise and you are sitting on good profits.

I'd also caution against only trying one play here, as ACHR is currently running but may not be ""the play"" by EOY still.

&nbsp;

**Sector Brief: Startups/Majors/Up/Downstream in UAM**

I own, or will soon buy shares or long dated options across all mentioned startups, Bell, and air mobility.  I think buying a spread of shares in IRA/Retirement ports across the segment is a good idea. Note I've dropped the tickers from small-caps to avoid getting a slap from VisualMod, but you should be able to find them by name.

* **Publicly traded startups:** Archer Aviation (ACHR), JOBY, Vertical Aerospace (UK), Lilium, EHANG (EH, Chinese), and EVEX (Embraer spinoff)

* **Major Aerospace:** Bell/Textron (TXT) who acquired Pipistrel, and Airbus (EADSF)

* **Upstream Suppliers:** “pick and shovel” investments (Batteries, Infrastructure) are not likely to experience significant effects from the eVTOL market yet. The ground EV market is already significantly bigger and more impactful to suppliers.

* **Downstream:** “Air Mobility” companies that offer helicopter services may experience bumps as they expand and market new more affordable eVTOL services to a wider audience. Blade Air Mobility (US) and Bristow Group (UK) are publicly traded.

* **ETFs** I have not found a dedicated ETF for this sector. BATW and (uh oh) ARKX have the highest exposure, but percentages are too small for them to mimic the sector as a whole.

* **Private Startups** Volocopter, Beta, and Wisk have good sales pipelines and revenue commitments. Keep an eye out for IPO or merger.

* Finally, some major players like Boeing may be active in spaces more related to military/niche segments that are harder to isolate by ticker or project eVTOL-specific gains.

&nbsp;

**Upcoming Calls on ERs for Mansion or GUH**

The next round of ERs occurs from very late July to August, but Option Volume is thin for dates other than quarterly expiration (mostly October).  These are the 3 most advanced startups, plus Bell Helicopter:

* ACHR as described above (4.5 or 5c 8/16 or 10/18)

* **JOBY 8/2 5c or 6c (extreme risk, thinly traded) or 10/18 7c (better volume/time).** JOBY is the most mature of the startups and has operating contracts in Dubai. They acquired Uber's attempt at eVTOL service several years ago.

* **EH 8/16 16c or 17c (Chinese company, extremely risky ER play, they have a 29 PT though).** It's Chinese, could do anything.

* **TXT 7/19 95c (very risky ER play, but they have a 100 PT).** Established, major Helicopter manufacturer, bought an eVTOL startup to jump ahead on production.

**Longer Dated high risk, high reward options plays (through Jan ’25 or beyond)**

* Vertical Aerospace 1/17/2025 2.5c.  Vertical had a flight test crash last summer that the valuation hasn’t recovered from. Good news before EOY should multiply the stock price.

* Lilium 10/18 1c or Jan ’25 1c. Really risky because Lilium’s Jet is still very early in design, but they’re actively publishing successful tests which could push these ITM as the sector valuation goes up across the board. Might be a sleeper smash hit for mid '25.

* EVEX – bad options chain, but consider 8/16 2.5c to play their ER as they may announce they will not do any more equity dilution after the current equity offer at $4/share and leverage the increase from the current 3.3 price to the $4 equity offering price.

&nbsp;

**Drawbacks/counterpoints**

* Certification may still take much longer than predicted. A Risk-averse FAA, failures during flight tests, and other issues may suddenly and unexpectedly push back viability by years.

* The predicted market may not emerge. The eVTOL use cases have a high-risk combination of needing to take share from fossil fuel helicopters and generate significant increases in the general usage of point-to-point “Air Taxi” service.

* Risk-averse institutional investors may wait until 2026 to pour in cash, when startups have proven operations and revenue streams.

* Major players like Textron/Bell and Airbus, privately held companies like Volocopter, and market share staying diffuse amongst many competitors may mean value increases are small for any given company.

* The sector may not generate the same hype as other speculative techs, causing no “meme” spikes in the short term.

**Positions** yeah they’re not huge but my gambling port and individual investment IRA are deliberately smaller to keep me from losing everything.

1dx97vv,2024-07-07 05:36:17,Completely basic DD on BCE,"Admittedly I don't do deep DD on my investments. I invest in what I know and/or like and/or trust, and that I think is currently trading at a good valuation. In fact two of my better recent investments were $NVEI and $CJT. I'm up 25% on $NVEI in only a few months, and the basis of my DD for investing was I heard Ryan Reynolds invested in it. And I'm up 22% on $CJT in a few weeks only, and that was based on the student investment club at my alma mater recommending it in a case competition that they won.

So with that disclaimer in mind, my latest investment in $BCE. What's my rationale? It is a blue chip, very stable Canadian company. $40b market cap in an industry dominated by a few players only. It is currently trading at a 5 year low, so this is about as cheap as you can get it. And because of that you also pick up an almost 10% dividend yield on it!!! If I can get something blue chip paying a 10% yield at a discounted price, I'm happy to sit on this at these lows, collect a good dividend, and wait for the market to strength and valuations start to rise back up at least to historical levels if not more. And even if they don't rise, I'm still getting my 10% dividend and I'm happy with that.

Why aren't people getting in to BCE at these low prices and with this dividend yield?",122,0.84,https://i.redd.it/n4oswdy1a1bd1.jpeg,wallstreetbets

It’s been awhile since I had to give up stocks and trading since I pretty much lost everything I had. Not the worst out there but considering I pretty much never had seen that much money before this was a substantial amount for me to bear and pretty much knocked me out of the game for awhile. I made some pretty dumb plays; trying to trade at work or on my 15 minute breaks, invested in bad penny stocks ( an EV stock)  lmfao, and overall I learned a good amount so if the day comes where I can get back into the market I’ll be more focused on investing in indexes and setting a small portion for trading on the side. Hats off to whoever made it successfully day trading. How long did it take for you to become successful and how much did you need to lose before that? I gave about a year of nonstop everyday learning the charts and the market but I just couldn’t do it. I’m only 23 I’ll be able to get back off the ground.

An add-on for Congress might be to require pre-clearance requests be made public on a central website 24h hours before being allowed to execute, if granted permission to trade by SEC ethics staff.

SEC staff have outright bans on options and many individual stocks, holding period requirements, required pre-clearnace of trades, etc., all of which extend to staff members' spouses and dependent children.

What if you (or a group of people) would just pick a couple of items and buy most of the stock. You would have complete control over the supplies and thus could set the price to whatever you want.

- DOJ Deal: $200M fine, 3 years probation, and an independent monitor.
- Victims' Families: Calling it a ""sweetheart deal"" and pushing for a trial.

Here’s the lowdown:

- Reputation: Can Boeing shake off this PR disaster, or is their brand forever tainted? Are we talking Titanic-level sinking, or can they pull a Houdini?
- Financials: Will the fine and potential legal battles sink their ship, or do they have the cash reserves to weather this storm?

Have you ever seen HOW MANY research papers NVIDIA publish in a year?

[Publications | Research (nvidia.com)](https://research.nvidia.com/publications)

  
It is in the HUNDEREDS. They are publishing more papers per year than most of the universities around the globe.

Can you still not comprehend how FAST their tech is advancing?

Let's check how is AMD doing? [AMD Research - Publications | AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/research/publications.html)

They published 8 papers in 2022. Meanwhile NVIDIA published MORE THAN 100.

And if you have any academic background in Computer Science or Computer Engineering, you will know that how frequent you will pop into a NVIDIA research for your studies.

This also shows us why their products are superiour and at least two generations ahead of their competition.

And this also shows us that why they will BUILD on that lead. Recent Blackwell announcement is also a hint on that. They are selling Datacenters costing MILLIONS of dollars per unit.

Personally I think that NVIDIA will reach 5T market cap in 2 years, and 10T market cap in 5 years.

# This trade is not about satellite radio.

Please understand that.

Every time this subject comes up it devolves into discussion about the future of satellite radio and which streaming app is best.  That's not the idea here.

If you want to buy SIRI (or hold it) when we're done that's another story.  (I'll include info on why you might in the comments.  I'm sure we can all supply reasons to be bearish.)

This is a short term trade involving two Liberty Media tickers.

The tickers are LSXMA and LSXMK (I may refer to them as LSXM- when I'm saying something that applies equally to both.)

# [Sometime ""early this quarter"" every share of LSXM- is going to transform into 8.4 shares of SIRI.](https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/522/liberty-media-and-siriusxm-announce-transaction-to-simplify)

(Since I just mentioned SIRI let me once again remind you that this trade is not about satellite radio or Pandora.)

[SIRI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SIRI/) closed at $3.53 on 3 July.  Since the market is always efficient that means that LSXM- closed at exactly $29.65.  [(3.53 \* 8.4 = 29.65)](https://www.google.com/search?q=3.53+*+8.4&sca_esv=2d68b74fb50c3936&sca_upv=1&sxsrf=ADLYWILAeAJ-xqtGbSMANonf0EQ3A2O5Jg%3A1720124639171&ei=3wSHZvGWCpD-ptQPkPSmmAc&ved=0ahUKEwixgtnQm46HAxUQv4kEHRC6CXMQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=3.53+*+8.4&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiCjMuNTMgKiA4LjRIvQ9QxQFY7QtwAXgAkAEAmAFeoAGEBaoBATi4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgGgAlnCAgUQIRifBZgDAIgGAZIHATGgB-4E&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)

Right?

The price is always right. Right?

Wrong.

[LSXMA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LSXMA/) closed at $22.76.  [LSXMK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LSXMK/) closed at $22.84.  How far off is that from where it should be?

LSXM- is trading at a 23% discount compared to its value in SIRI shares.

If SIRI holds at $3.53 and you own LSXM-, you can sell it all on the day the shares convert for a 23% profit.  If SIRI rises by the time of the conversion you'll make more.  If it falls by then you'll make less. << *This is  oversimplified*

I suspect it will hold or rise.

I'll leave my reasons for that in my comment below so we can skip the ""Howard Stern is sus"" comments (he definitely is, that's his schtick), the ""I can't afford a car with a radio"" comments (no shame in that, cars are expensive) and get to picking apart this play.

# Part two: the options are calling.

For some reason LSXM- has been ignored compared to SIRI, and that includes its option chain.

[Take a look at the IV on SIRI calls for Aug 16.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SIRI/options/?type=calls&date=1723766400)

I picked that date because it's the middle of the quarter and the deal should be done by then or at least close enough that arbitrageurs are closing the gap.  At the time of writing the ATM calls are showing 99% IV.

[Now look at LSXMK calls for the same date.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SIRI/options/?type=calls&date=1723766400)

At the time of writing the IV for ATM calls is 52% and the last sold price is $1.25.  **But wait! What's truly ATM right now?** The price of LSXMK or the price of (SIRI \* 8.4)? If the latter, then the true ATM strike is $29 and the last sold price is 10¢.

When those shares convert you'll be holding ATM calls on SIRI with a lot size of 840 shares and a cost basis of 10¢ per share.

If you think the merger will take longer to complete or that SIRI may be worth owning after the discount then the leaps may be an even better deal.

[Here are the LSXMK calls for Jan '25.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LSXMK/options/?type=calls&date=1737072000)

The $28 strike last sold for 55¢ with an IV of 57%.  But that gives you almost 5X the amount of time to figure out what to do with it plus $1 lower strike.

Given the time he started buying I think arbitrage is exactly what he had in mind.  The stocks have dropped since then.  Maybe they will buy more since the discount has opened up again, maybe they have all they want.  I don't know.

Does the good news with this company ever stop?

Anyway, key point of the article imo:

_The latest move appears to be a part of CEO Masayoshi Son’s broader plan to position SoftBank as a leader in AI technology, for which it has started discussions with banks about borrowing money to fund up to $10 billion in energy-related projects driven by AI demand, The Information reported on Thursday._

And then this little nugget which is an entirely new concept to me for banks:

_SoftBank, a backer of companies like Tencent, T Mobile, 10x Genomics (NASDAQ:TXG), and Automation Anywhere, among others, could look to create a special-purpose company to purchase the GPUs with borrowed funds, and would then lease the GPUs to SoftBank, allowing the firm to keep the debt off its balance sheet._

It has potential to be an S&P 500 addition and could see a nice boost in revenue (and hopefully margins) this quarter from their Al servers/computer sales.

https://www.ft.com/content/b76ef55b-21cd-498b-ac16-5660908bb8d2

_Nvidia is on course to sell $12bn worth of artificial intelligence chips in China this year despite US export controls that have throttled its business in one of the world’s biggest semiconductor markets.
The $3tn Silicon Valley group will over the coming months deliver more than 1mn of its new H20 chips, which are designed to fall outside of US restrictions on selling AI processors to Chinese customers, according to analyst forecasts._

_That figure is almost twice as many as Huawei is expected to sell of its China-made rival product, Ascend 910B, according to estimates from SemiAnalysis, a chip consultancy._

_Nvidia is the latest Silicon Valley company to find itself entangled in tensions between Washington and Beijing. The Biden administration wants to stem the flow of the world’s most powerful chips to China, fearing Beijing may use them to create more powerful AI systems with military applications._

_The resulting shortage of AI chips has hit the ability of Chinese tech groups such as ByteDance, Tencent and Alibaba to compete with US-based OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta and Google in a technology that is reshaping the industry._

_Each H20 chip costs between $12,000 and $13,000, suggesting that Nvidia is likely to generate upwards of $12bn in sales. That would be more than the $10.3bn revenue made from its entire China business — including selling graphics chips to PC gamers and other products — in the financial year ending in January 2024._

_Nvidia declined to comment on the forecasts. Huawei did not respond to a request for comment.
Ever since the Biden administration first introduced restrictions on Nvidia’s ability to sell its most powerful AI chips in China in 2022, the US company has warned that its business would suffer as cloud computing providers and AI start-ups there turned to local alternatives such as Huawei._

_“Our business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, said during the company’s most recent earnings call in May. “And it’s a lot more competitive in China now, because of the limitations on our technology . . . However, we continue to do our best to serve the customers in the markets there.”
Colette Kress, Nvidia’s finance chief, said on the same call that revenue from its data centre segment — which includes AI chips — in China in the latest quarter was “down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October”._

_As recently as 2021, before the US began imposing export controls, China accounted for more than a quarter of Nvidia’s total revenues. Even if the H20 chip sells as well as analysts expect, China could be closer to 10 per cent of sales this year. But that also reflects the huge growth that Nvidia is seeing from US tech companies as they build out ever-larger AI systems._

_Although Nvidia’s sales in China have been lower ahead of the rollout of the new H20 this spring, analysts at both Morgan Stanley and SemiAnalysis say that the chip is now being shipped in volume and is proving popular with Chinese customers, despite its downgraded performance compared with the chips Nvidia can sell in the US._

_“Buyers report positive feedback on the potential competitiveness of H20 clusters,” Morgan Stanley wrote in a research note to clients this week, pointing to “strong China demand”._

1dva89a,2024-07-04 15:54:44, TSLA and deliverables: Elon and his history of polished products.,"Let me start by saying I love the IDEA of Tesla. Back in 2016-2017 when they announced the Model 3, a beautiful, eco-friendly electric car that was affordable, I was so excited and wanted to put in a pre-order despite not knowing the full cost.

Lo and behold, there were delays.

When FSD was hyped, and the concept of fully autonomous driving was the main selling point, it reignited my enthusiasm. Over a 6 years later (1) autonomous cars still require attentiveness and are far from the “car drive themselves” level promised by Musk, even with massive amounts of investment, programmers etc. at his disposal at the time (he has since significantly reduced his work force). What’s worse is he has removed LiDAR, and believes you just need eyes and a brain… yet any basic science undergraduate can tell you the difference between the macula vs peripheral vision, and draw a simple analogy between cameras and LiDAR. A choice, I think, was a mistake.

He unveiled smart summon, a pretty amazing feature in theory, and fundamental to robotaxi, but it seems even Tesla owners don’t use it because it is buggy (2). Which may be a hint at how far off autonomous ride hailing could be— competitors like Waymo, which are solely focused on this technology have advanced considerably but not making such bold claims it seems, because they are grounded in reality. Bugs, glitches, and a lack of true intuitive humanness/user experience (3).

That leaves us with Robotaxi and Optimus. No doubt these are *in theory* incredible advancements, but what timeline, in reality, should we expect for these? Will the world be massively disappointed yet again? Or is this the turning point for TSLA and its ability to live up to its lofty ambitions? 

TL;DR
Elon will always have a reach further than his grasp. Are we just getting jerked around?

1dv7nq7,2024-07-04 14:01:37,Just Do It and Buy Some NKE Calls,"Yes, I know the metallic taste lingers in everyone's mouth from the recent earnings decline. While this downturn may have impacted your portfolio, I believe the current bottom floor is an excellent opportunity. I honestly think this could be the biggest trading opportunity this year.

First things first: Nike has faced a few obstacles that need to be addressed. Nike's expected revenue fell short in Q4 2024, coming in at $12.6 billion compared to $12.9 billion. The 2% year-over-year decline is driven by an 8% drop in direct-to-consumer sales (Nike-owned stores). This decline, paired with less-than-ideal guidance, dampened investor spirits, leaving us with NKE at a price **unseen since 2020**. Rarely do we see a blue-chip stock present an entry opportunity like this. The best part? We have a worldwide marketing event beginning in 22 days. **Hence, I believe this is an ideal position to springboard towards 50x, perhaps even 100x profits**.

Nike is an elite shoe and sportswear company. The market overreacted to EPS reports and oversold. Now, we can take advantage of the largest single-day drop in the company's history to secure an excellent position. Nike isn't going anywhere. While Hoka and ON footwear are currently outperforming Nike, the latter remains head and shoulders above these companies. Nike boasts half a century of experience in this industry and is known for continuous innovation with products like Flyknit, Air Max, and React. The company has a significant global presence, reaching over 190 countries, and extends its influence beyond sports into popular culture through high-profile endorsements and sponsorships. This global influence is what I believe will yield the most profits.

The Summer Olympics are around the corner: July 26 - August 11. Nike has long been a prominent sponsor and supplier of the event, dating back to 1972. This enhances its global visibility and prestige. Comparing Nike to Hoka, ON, or even Lululemon is like comparing Coke to Dr. Pepper. You will never see these companies come close to replacing a giant like Nike in sponsoring major global events. Historically, Nike's stock has responded positively to the Olympics due to increased brand exposure and elite athletic association. Specifically, with every NKE earnings release preceding a major sporting event, the stock declined 75% of the time. Before the 2012 London Olympics, Nike shares fell 9%. Before 2008 Beijing? Yep, fell 10%. During and after the Olympics, we can expect to see positive movement. As such, I believe a price target of $90 is reasonable. This will boost investor confidence and transform this challenging period into a golden opportunity.

That's why the dips get bigger as they go because they fall to bigger moving averages. This one was falling to the 200 day moving average on the 1 day period chart  After it Cycled through all the other common smaller moving averages making the smaller dips . As the crypto grew  It dipped down to previous smaller moving averages in order such as the 100 day was the previous dip and 50 day was the dip before that. Et cetera.  In my opinion it should be done now that it hit it. And then it will cycle through all of the Moving average periods again as it rises and this time the final big dip will be when it falls to the 200 day moving average on the 1 week chart. That will be the big crash at the end of the bull market.  That's just my opinion and not advice. I seem to see this pattern roughly in many charts but who knows I could be crazy. LOL

1duzyn4,2024-07-04 06:18:49,AI already uses as much energy as a small country and this is only the beginning.,"In January, the International Energy Agency (IEA) issued its forecast for global energy use over the next two years. Included for the first time were projections for electricity consumption associated with data centers, cryptocurrency, and artificial intelligence.

This usage represented almost 2 percent of global energy demand in 2022 — and that demand for these uses could double by 2026, which would make it roughly equal to the amount of electricity used by the entire country of Japan.

We live in the digital age, where many of the processes that guide our lives are hidden from us inside computer code. We are watched by machines behind the scenes that bill us when we cross toll bridges, guide us across the internet, and deliver us music we didn’t even know we wanted. All of this takes material to build and run — plastics, metals, wiring, water — and all of that comes with costs.

As the world heats up toward increasingly dangerous temperatures and with governments agreeing on net zero targets we should be able to capitalise on a market that I think will be probably booming relatively soon.

1dusl5s,2024-07-03 23:35:06,Everybody Uses $LIF. My BULL Thesis,"**Story**

I have been using $LIF since 2020 because my 3 siblings used it and wanted me to share locations with them. It wasn't really on my mind since I didn't trade back then but come to 2023 when I'm in freshman year of college, every person is using it other than find my iPhone for locations. Life360 seems to be the most applicable app for location sharing among families or friends due to it being available on both Android and Apple. When the IPO occurred I talked to my sister who is still in highschool if she likes life360 and she told me she bought the premium subscription for it. Therefore leading me to my bull thesis and deeper due diligence.

**Fundamentals**

The balance sheet if looking back since 2020 seems pretty strong with cash and equivalents being greater than the total debt, therefore meaning won't go bust in the face of economic downturn. The total assets were also increasing since 2020 up to 2023 along with the debt decreasing or coming back to about what is was in 2020 in 2023.

The losses are decreasing yoy, the revenue from both service and hardware is increasing yoy, and therefore the losses are shrinking yoy.

I have discovered while doing my research that LIF owns Tile and Jiobit. Tile seems to be around a lot if you look for them while talking to people. Their brand isn't just the app but also physical products as well which shows they are expanding.

**Technical**

The trend beings displayed is upwards in the daily charts.

https://preview.redd.it/9e2nhvmiydad1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=1eb90c7709012738173941964402e0026da58f33

**Narrative**

Based on my readings about Peter Lynch's trading ideology and the idea of narrative economics by Robert J. Shiller, here is my narrative.

People in my daily life are using life360 all around me and I see their products in people's wallets and keys. Even I use the products they have and my sister buys their subscription service. My girlfriends whole family uses it as well. In a quick summary, everybody uses it and people who didn't use it are starting to because it is a ""trend."" This seems to fit the ideology about having a good story by Peter Lynch.

However, to add more on to this; there is way more to the narrative. The trend has already started and people are willing to pay for a free app to get more benefits out of it and a lot of times guys who use it or never used it don't really care about it. What is one thing every guy will do as they get older of just live? They will start dating and getting partners. Along with a growing want for safety with location sharing, the girlfriends of the boyfriends would want them to have a location sharing app and especially if they have differing phone brands it increases the need for a universal location sharing product. Even families will want location sharing for family safety which means the consumers are not just teenagers or young adults but older people as well.

The growth of the usage of the app seems pretty dang expansive and with our world become more integrated with technology and people's willingness to buy subscriptions, the business seems to be just at the start of growing bigger. Since subscriptions aren't as easily noticeable by the buyer like a physical product, they will be less inclined to consider it a big expense and keep it steady which equals continuous profit. As long as people want a universal app for safety, this company can provide for as long as possible.

I am not sure if they are allowed to sell data, but they could also seel that data for AI purposes down the line since AI is starting to hit a barrier where they are running out of data to train it with.

Additionally, life360 has a social media presence and in my experience, a sns presence equates to a growing company. The feelings of the mass that is displayed in social media such as tiktok or instragram also provides a good idea on if the stock is doing good or bad at the moment.

**Position and NOT FA**

IDK how to post multiple images on here so I will just comment by position. My position isn't that big but it is about 83% of my portfolio because I am broke.

**TLDR**

Fundamentals and technical analysis is good. The company seems to be able to expand more. The stock tells a good narrative. If following socials, life360 has a positive and growing vibe around it.

1duqpbi,2024-07-03 22:07:49,$DIS Disney is at a once in a decade buying opportunity,"This is the weekly chart for $DIS. Each candle represents one week of trading and the chart goes back to 2010.

https://preview.redd.it/1wqkuxf0ldad1.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&s=33e19b58c9f5fa193d355ad551aca96a5061c85c

$DIS has been in a clear uptrend for more than a decade, until the 2022 bear market showed up, inflation and the mini recession wrecked the stock market and $DIS in particular. 

The dark green line is the 80-week moving average. Which represents the average weekly closing price of the last 80 weeks.   
Whenever this moving average is trending up, the equity in question is in an uptrend and vice versa.

Notice how the moving average trended down for nearly two years between 2022 and 2024.

Since the beginning of the year it flattened and has actually been slowly curling up.

Once price breaks above this moving average and comes back to it, it's called a breakout and backtest setup.

This is an incredibly bullish setup with high odds of success. It gives buyers one final chance of entering after the first major breakout.

Now I want you to take a closer look at the volume. Notice how weekly volume has actually been declining as the price has been dropping throughout the last 3 months. This is exactly what you want to see. You want to see sellers less and less interested as the price drops and then you want to see volume expand once buyers are back in and price is trending higher.

ENTRY :  
Now, let's talk about timing the entry. Let's take a look at the zoomed-in portion in pink.  
You will notice that $DIS has a tendency to form a bull flag / bull penant / wedge structure and as soon as price breaks above the resistance level of this structure the stock rallies for several weeks.

Right now we are in the middle of a 3rd one of these structures that hasn't broken out yet. The objective entry would be on the first breakout of this structure if you're looking to trade this aggressively.

Personally. I'm quite happy with the 80-week backtest and I don't want to wait for the breakout so I can buy it here while it's cheap..

TARGET :  
If the stock simply retraces back to the middle of its long-term uptrending channel. That would translate to a rally upwards of $160 by the end of next year.

The December 2025 $120 leap call options are trading at $7.3. That means if the $160 target is realized by the end of 2025, those options will net $40 in profit. a 550% gain in 18 months.  
If the price target is realized earlier, those options will net even higher profit. And if $DIS exceeds this price target, again those gains would be much higher.  
I like the Dec 2025 $120 calls because the far out expiration drastically reduces this risk of theta decay, and gives this setup plenty of time to realize the price target.

Keep in mind that the full-measured move from this consolidation pattern actually puts $DIS at $150 by the end of this year. Which can return an excess of 2000% given how cheap the call options currently are. Just beware of the risk if you're trading this year's Dec expirations.

Good luck regards.

1duqja3,2024-07-03 22:00:43,"Same post, four days later.","I firmly believe that Tesla (TSLA) has the potential to reach $250 before August, and here's why:

Historical Performance of QQQ in July: Historically, July has been a strong month for the QQQ. Given this historical trend, I expect the bullish momentum in QQQ to influence Tesla’s price movement.

Capital Rotation from NVIDIA to Other Stocks: The recent surge in NVIDIA’s stock has captured significant investor interest. As the stock market operates in cycles, I anticipate a capital rotation where investors move profits from one high-performing stock to others. With NVIDIA’s impressive rally, it’s likely that investors will take profits and seek opportunities in other promising tech stocks like Tesla. This influx of capital can drive Tesla’s stock price higher. 

Combined FOMO from Robotaxi Event, Optimus, and Earnings: Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi event, the developments around Tesla Optimus, and its earnings report are all highly anticipated. The FOMO on potentially groundbreaking announcements related to Tesla’s advancements in autonomous driving technology and the Tesla Optimus robot, combined with the anticipation of positive earnings results, can create substantial buying pressure.

I’ll keep you all updated as you tell me I’m wrong, I’ve only just started trading last month with $500, but I’ve been able to grow it pretty fast with NVIDIA puts and Tesla calls :)

The position reports are hard to visualize b/c there are a lot of trades but the normal trade is to hedge options with contracts until price moves in the right direction then drop the hedge since slippage is much less with contracts. Sometimes, I do the reverse and buy cheaper OTM options in order to buy more contracts. Number of contracts is usually determined by delta of option with a little yolo mixed in at times.

1duncbc,2024-07-03 19:44:48,"SMCI will skyrocket soon, DONT MISS OUT!","So currently SMCI is around the $840 to $850 levels but hit $775 on monday. This meant that there is still a chance to buy SMCI while the shares are cheap right before they release their earnings in a month. The reason why im bullish on SMCI is because AI is driving the stock to skyrocket as they work alongside Nvidia and AMD in providing data centres. Elon musk had also catapulted the stock to reach over $1000 as he had tweeted that he is partnering with Dell and SMCI to provide AI data centres for its generative AI chatbot.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/super-micro-computer-ceo-post-picuture-with-elon-musk-at-ai-data-center-432SI-3505317

As a result of this, SMCI will most likely smash their earnings report of $8.10 per share in early august and hopefully make the stock reach above $1100, which is a 30% increase from what the share price is today.

1dulo16,2024-07-03 18:34:33,FDA Greenlights Eli Lilly's Groundbreaking Alzheimer's Drug,"The FDA on Tuesday approved Eli Lilly's drug donanemab, marketed under the brand name Kisunla, for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Eli Lilly announced that the drug is suitable for adults with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and will improve the currently limited treatment options available to U.S. patients suffering from this brain-wasting disease.

""This is real progress,"" said Joanne Pike, president and CEO of the Alzheimer's Association. ""Tuesday's approval allows people more options and greater opportunity to have more time.""

According to Alzheimer's Association data, nearly 7 million Americans suffer from this disease, which is the fifth leading cause of death among adults over 65 in the United States. By 2050, the number of patients in the U.S. is expected to reach nearly 13 million.

For Eli Lilly, this approval marks a long-anticipated victory, as it signifies the end of a tumultuous approval process for donanemab. In early 2023, the FDA had rejected accelerated approval for the drug based on early trial results, instructing Lilly to submit more trial data. After Lilly provided the additional data, the FDA unexpectedly delayed approval again in March this year.

It wasn't until last month that the drug received the green light from an FDA advisory panel, leading to FDA approval finally being granted on Tuesday.

Anne White, president of Eli Lilly Neuroscience, stated in an interview, ""There's a lot of emotion in the hallways today.""

Following the regulatory approval, donanemab will face direct competition from Leqembi, an Alzheimer's treatment developed by Japan's Eisai and America's Biogen. Leqembi had already received FDA approval last summer and has been gradually rolling out in the U.S.

Within the industry, both donanemab and Leqembi are considered milestone drugs in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Both are monoclonal antibodies targeting toxic substances called amyloid plaques in the brain, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's, to slow disease progression in early-stage patients.

However, donanemab has shown better efficacy compared to Leqembi. According to a late-stage trial, donanemab slowed cognitive decline by 35% compared to the placebo group. After reaching certain targets for amyloid plaque clearance, patients could end treatment and switch to a placebo at 6, 12, or 18 months.",11,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dulo16/fda_greenlights_eli_lillys_groundbreaking/,wallstreetbets

This is a great company with lots of potential. Hedge funds and rich stock market investors have overlooked the value of this company just like they overlook the people that buy this product. They have overblown the digital risks for BYND and they have negative sentiment about the company that can be seen by the huge short interest. The value of BYND is overlooked. Every time I go to the store this product is selling great and they introduce new variations of the product. I get it...many people like real meat; however, the market for plant based food like BYND has increased to almost a 28 billion dollar a year industry. Wall Street is betting that BYND is going to fail but vegans like me are not going away even though we get laughed at and are often the punch line to jokes. You may even be laughing as you read this post. If BYND fails and goes bankrupt the people that work there will loose their job and the millionaire/billionaire hedge fund people that bet against this company will make a huge profit. We the people can take back the power and help this company be successful by investing in BYND. I know the overall share price wave has decreased since they went public in 2019; however, I personally believe this company is an underdog company that will have a great comeback story that will go in the Wall Street history books with an upward trending wave. If you do research you will see the cattle farming industry is running out of land to farm and raise animals and they have to pump the animals with antibiotics and steroids so they can grow faster and not have disease to keep up with the consumer demand. If the world or our country has a major disaster it would definitely impact the cattle farming and food industry and many would have to turn to eating plant based foods like BYND even if we didn't want to. It's better to get the upper hand now and invest in BYND and take advantage of the blessings that will ultimately come. I no way is this post endorsing BYND and I'm not telling you to go buy the stock. I honestly just want to know your thoughts and I'm praying the AI bot or administrator doesn't delete this post.",0,0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1duj5nn/beyond_on_the_rise/,wallstreetbets

1duggni,2024-07-03 14:59:50,ZIM: Let's go again!,"I believe ZIM will soar to at least $40 (x2), maybe more, in the next 4-6 weeks. Here’s why:

**Market Situation**

1. **Container Shipping Rates:** They’ve skyrocketed and show no signs of stopping.
2. **Red Sea Drama:** With the Red Sea routes disrupted, ships are taking the scenic route around Africa. This requires 10-12% more ships, absorbing last year’s new builds and most of the upcoming new fleet.
3. **Container Chaos:** More ships mean more disorganized containers. Shippers hate waiting for empty containers, leaving them at destination ports.
4. **Tariff Tango:** Biden’s tariff increases have importers scrambling to ship earlier than the usual August-October peak. Inventories are low after years of adjustments.
5. **Trump’s Tariff Tease:** With Trump promising additional tariffs, companies are likely to import more now to avoid future costs. It’s like a retail apocalypse, but for shipping!

Rates logically going up

**Zim Shipping**

1. **Big Player:** ZIM is the 10th largest shipping company, mostly leasing boats but owning a few.
2. **Volatile Market:** Shipping is ultra-competitive. When companies make money, they all buy boats, leading to oversupply, like in 2023.
3. **Red Sea Plans:** Like others, ZIM expects Red Sea issues to ease and rates to drop with a large supply of new vessels by year-end.
4. **Management’s Gloomy Outlook:** Despite being insiders, ZIM’s management didn’t foresee the recent rate spikes and forecasted a tough year-end during earnings calls.
5. **Genius Move:** ZIM didn’t contract volume for their fleet this year, a rarity. Normally, 70% is contracted to limit volatility, but this year, 65% operates on spot rates, which are currently exploding. They avoided low rates proposed by customers expecting a drop. I don't know if this was thought through but I only care about the result, a genuis move!

**Reasons to Believe**

1. **FOMO & Tariff Talk:** Supply chain directors are ordering because they are seeing chaos coming and don't want to loss their job. For COVID-19, they had a good excuse, but this time, they will be asked to explain why they bragged last year and have nothing to sale this year. Panic buying is imminent if rates hit $8K in August. Funny, right? Not so much for them.
2. **Shanghai-LA Route:** ZIM has 30% of their fleet here. Spot rates are at $6,6K, up from Q1’s $1.9K.
3. **Printing Money:** ZIM made a killing in 2021 and 2022 when shipping was underestimated. Wall Street will catch on.
4. **Q2 Earnings:** ZIM will likely post $600-800M in Q2. Estimates are lower due to delivery payment arguments, but surcharges could boost earnings. Q3 could see $1.2-1.5B if rates stabilize and I am not talking if they goes to 10k.
5. **Undervalued:** We're talking about $2B in two quarters for a company valued at $2.6B. With 11% short interest, the market’s in for a surprise.

**Counter Arguments**

1. **Red Sea Resolved:** Sure, Middle Eastern politics will magically stabilize in 2-3 months (sarcasm intended). And the whole situation has nothing to do with Russian/Iran and co. Everybody wants the peace especially the houtis
2. **Rates Drop:** Absolutely, Americans will suddenly stop buying because they are planning to save money when the stock market is at all time high. And shipping remains the world's cheapest option to import cheap China goods even at $10K per container. And China needs to export.
3. **Huge Debt:** ZIM’s $5.3B debt includes lease obligations for the next 5-8 years. It’s like counting Microsoft’s electricity bills for the next 8 years as debt. The reality is Zim will likely redistribute around $10-12 of the profit this year.
4. **No change in the Summer:** Possible, but shipping’s peak season starts in August, anticipating post-summer and Black Friday demand. Usually big moves are in the summer for shipping. If you have 6 hours of your life to kill, watch this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KovvaLWBSs4&t=2007s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KovvaLWBSs4&t=2007s) . Ok, I will be nice with you, 5:21:00.

**Conclusion**

The situation isn’t as clear-cut as 2021/2022 when there were no boats. The influx of new vessels will affect rates, but political tariff talk will likely spur cautious, anticipatory corporate actions. Once rates hit $8K in 2-3 weeks, expect a panic buying spree. Buckle up; ZIM might just rocket.",24,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1duggni/zim_lets_go_again/,wallstreetbets
1duga9b,2024-07-03 14:52:20,Cathy Wood cut some of her Tesla ( TSLA ) stock and increased her stake in emerging drone maker Archer Aviation ( ACHR ) Is ACHR Worth Watch,"Wood and Ark Invest sold a total of 62,867 shares of Tesla stock on Tuesday, valued at $14.538 million at the closing price of 231.26. Meanwhile, Wood and ARK purchased 406,912 shares of Archer Aviation stock on Tuesday, valued at $1.51 million based on a closing price of 3.72. San Jose-based Archer is developing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for urban environments, with the goal of creating a robust air cab service. Archer Aviation received an additional $55 million investment from Stellantis (STLA) on Tuesday through a strategic financing agreement. Stellantis invested $110 million in Archer in 2023 through a series of open market stock purchases and strategic agreement investments. The investment follows Archer's June 8 completion of a critical test flight of its Midnight aircraft.



On June 5, the company announced that it had received FAA certification to begin operating as a commercial airline, and on June 17, Archer entered into an agreement with Signature Aviation to provide it with access to the world's largest network of private airline terminals. Under the agreement, Archer plans to launch air cab services as early as the end of 2025 at United Airlines (UAL) hubs at Newark International Airport and Chicago O'Hare Airport. The agreement also gives Archer access to takeoff and landing locations in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Texas.



Signature Aviation operates more than 200 private terminals worldwide. According to the company, Archer plans to expand throughout its network as aircraft availability increases.



On June 20, Archer unveiled additional plans to establish an air mobility network at five locations in the San Francisco Bay Area.",10,0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1duga9b/cathy_wood_cut_some_of_her_tesla_tsla_stock_and/,wallstreetbets

Is this the contrarian indicator we are waiting for.

PMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) chief global markets strategist Marko Kolanovic is planning to leave the bank, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing an internal memo it obtained.

Kolanovic is perhaps infamously known for his conflicting stock-market calls over the past two years which have differed significantly from Wall Street's actual performance.

Kolanovic, who according to his LinkedIn profile has been at JPMorgan (JPM) for over 16 years, is ""exploring other opportunities,"" as per the memo as quoted by Bloomberg.

Kolanovic also served as co-head of JPMorgan's (JPM) global research. The memo said Hussein Malik will now become the sole head.

JPMorgan (JPM) did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha, and neither did Kolanovic nor Malik.

Kolanovic was consistently bullish on U.S. equities for much of 2022, a year in which the benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) slumped nearly 20%.

The analyst turned bearish towards the end of the market bottoming out, and has remained firmly so even as the S&P (SP500) rebounded almost 25% in 2023 and advanced more than 14% in H1 2024.

As recently as Friday, Kolanovic backed his ultra-bearish year-end target of 4,200 points for the S&P 500 (SP500), even as the index has powered past 5,500 and has caused other brokerages to drive up their estimates.",116,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1due7dq/another_bear_bites_the_dust_jpms_kolanovic/,wallstreetbets

Inflationary pressure continues. Insurance rates will continue to climb. As shipping costs continue to go up...

I don't actually know what this means, but 2.3 million sounds like a big number. And big number of options mean big volumes of trade. And big number of trade means the stock will either move up or down bigly.

Then there is another Porsche stock, $PAH3, which is a holding company that owns the majority of Volkswagen stock.

Porsche Holding is extremely undervalued with a P/E ratio of 2.53, which is even lower than the P/E ratio of Volkswagen and much lower than the P/E of $P911.

Can someone explain to me why Porsche Holding is so cheap? When buying this stock, it essentially means buying the Porsche manufacturing company at a 30-40% discount, plus you also get the other stocks that Volkswagen owns.

TL;DR: $PAH3 is extremely cheap, or I’m highly regarded (maybe both).

Arguably the greatest investor of our time warren buffet used a buy and hold good companies strategy. Even if you hate elon musk the reality is tesla is a good company.  The question is do you believe in their vision. 

I personally think tesla is investing for a future economy where they are primary disruptors. And I wouldn't be surprised if they are the most valuable company in the world by 2030. 

This is because as many of you may not fully appreciate, tesla has a moat. They own the full ecosystem of technology. They have the charging infrastructure, the manufacturing capacity to build robotaxis/humanoid robots, energy storage,  software development, the data, and even lithium production. The fact that tesla owns the full stack of technology gives them a competitive advantage. The robotaxi and humanoid robot industries are going to be the key pillars of the 21st century industrial revolution ushering in a productivity and profit boom.

1dtqhqx,2024-07-02 16:46:28,Visa moon theory in light of recent SC rulings,"So, two related SC rulings that play into this

1) corner post

2) chevron 

There’s plenty of room for nuance and I’ve got to look into it much, much more, but, here’s my general take aways

1) swipe fee companies can create as many bullshit companies as they want to challenge regulations in perpetuity 

2) swipe fee companies can jack rates indiscriminately with no regard for regulations outside the letter of the law.

While the chevron ruling includes a caveat that it’s not retroactively “undoing” everything established, they make it clear that those precedents are not set in stone either. They literally are not law. Therefore, between the two cases, swipe fee companies should be able to generate companies to challenge regulations at will, forever, and the regulations they challenge, outside that which is outlined in the underlying law, essentially have no authority. Obviously, the SC is gonna do what it wants regardless of hypocrisy and/or technicality, but if there isn’t a hard on for swipe fee companies I think in time this could mean the cuffs just got reallll loose

Main point of the article:

_Per Morgan Stanley’s note, major hyperscalers in China, while complying with export control regulations, are purchasing NVIDIA’s H20 chips for AI computing needs. Although smaller AI data center vendors in China can offer the H100 GPU for rental, the larger hyperscalers are opting to buy the H20, adhering to the regulatory requirements.
Based on their field trip takeaways, analysts said the single-chip performance of the H20 is only 15% that of the H100. Furthermore, when comparing ""Performance Density"" based on the Float 16 data type, the H20's single chip performance is only 3% of that of the H100.
“However, by connecting a cluster of H20 GPUs, performance can reach 50% of that of the H100, thanks to higher networking bandwidth and the HBM density of H20,” analysts pointed out. “And hence it is possible the H20 chip price could also be 50% of H100.”_

Jensen keeps telling y’all the world isn’t waiting on shit — the AI race is on now, and there’s no stopping it in the near future. Does that guarantee NVDA will dominate like this for the next decade? I don’t fucking know, I work at Wendy’s.

But when even your biggest political foe cannot keep its hands off nvda chips, may be some of you chubby berrs should give it a rest too.

* I've spent a lot of time with data science and AI, but I rarely see Palantir products in the wild. Snowflake's products, for comparison, are pretty ubiquitous for data engineering.
* The AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform) looks great on paper, but it'll take a lot of resources to implement it. Just picture trying to integrate all the production and logistics details of even a small-sized company—it’s a huge task that requires a lot of Palantir experts and thus money.
* This brings me to the next thing: Palantir was often called a ""glorified"" IT consulting company, not a real software company. From what I know, Palantir doesn't have its own foundational AI model. AIP is ""just"" a platform for implementing models like GPT-4 and mirroring a company's internal networks. Such customized software solutions must be a huge effort to create and maintain. But what's the moat here? That doesn't mean that the resulting software is bad, but how does this scale? To me, this sounds like a consulting business...
* Palantir has a great reputation thanks to its government contracts. But this mainly comes from the days when it was hard for government organizations to find good programmers - perfect conditions for an IT consulting company. 
* Palantir's bulls often say that the company's most advanced technology is top secret, which makes it hard to see how they're ahead of the game. If these cutting-edge technologies are only for the military and intelligence, then Palantir is basically a defense contractor, which also doesn’t justify the current valuation.

Let this be a lesson to every regard that strikes it rich. Never Fomo in again and get angry when making investment decisions, because you will get your bootywhole pummeled without lube and it will be brutal

I think what makes this post 10x more brutal is that I'm 28 so this is basically my life savings lol

I was planning on taking a chick out to vacay and buying a property but I guess I'll do that in the next 3 years or so lol

THE STORY

The reason why I didn't buy calls again after the stellar earnings report is because after having traded Nvidia for several months, I knew what kind of monster I was dealing with. High sensitivity to federal reserve rate announcements, the war in Gaza, tech shows etc. even when I put a stop loss I'd wake up and see it sell and blow past the stop loss I put it at so if I sell early I lose if I don't sell I lose it was all fucked lol

So I was like ok let's avoid the stress of waking up and seeing me getting fucked because of a bad position or for it to drop back down to the low thousands I'll just stay out for a bit

Little did I know, this fucking company would go up 40% over the span of 2 months with only a 20% increase in guidance. How does that even remotely make sense

But it's clear that stock markets have long abandoned rational movement patterns. It should have stopped around 1150 or 1200 and corrected down to 1100 or something but nah that Bch kept going up

And it just pissed me off so much, I could've full ported again and had half a million in the bank and never had to deal with this shit again, but I opted out and opted back in at the worst possible time and in the worst way possible lmao

Knowing my luck this shits gonna trade sideways for the rest of July and then start the ascent on August so I'll buy august calls when they're a little cheaper and do another full port on this earnings. After that I'll probably ride the gains for a week and never touch this shit again lol

Either that or lose every penny 🤣🤣🤣🤣

1dtba91,2024-07-02 02:42:30,Resist the urge to short healthcare stocks as they print new ATHs this year,"People will hate buy puts on LLY/NVO/HIMS and other pharma shit bc of the “it’s up so much already, it’s due for a pullback or reduced earnings from new competition, tech level valuations for pharma companies isn’t reasonable” trap. 

Especially as LLY becomes the first trillion dollar healthcare company owing to their GLP1 and other longevity breakthroughs (and kicks off market wide fomo). 

They’ll “average” into puts and wake up to new ATHs. It’ll drive them insane. If you don’t believe me, ask the guy here who’s been shorting LLY since 400$ and seetheposting begging people to buy puts every other week. 

I think what bers get wrong is that healthcare isn’t like electronics or utilities or other goods (where you anticipate spending/costs/margins/earnings growth hitting a wall from all the advancements). 

On the contrary, as we inch towards a world that’s more and more automated (despite what all the doomers calling for the end of the world want to believe), healthcare is the only sector that will justify and see more spending imo. 

If spared from the usual mundane burdens of life (owing to increased efficiency across the economy), Wouldn’t you spend more of your income and time on healthcare? Whether surface level stuff like fixing baldness (to signal status in a world where those games are inescapable) or serious stuff like addiction or obesity which leads to overall well being? 

I personally (even if a bit naive) am hopeful for an optimistic future where all of us spend a larger % of our income —on everything from glp1, reversible gene therapy, early prevention solutions unique to your DNA profile— in an attempt to extend our lifetime, if only because everything else in life has become much more cheaper/accessible. 

Also, all this doesn’t even have to play out. If the market believes it will, even if only in a brief moment of mass psychosis, ur puts r fuk. ",27,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dtba91/resist_the_urge_to_short_healthcare_stocks_as/,wallstreetbets

The stock market regularly fucks up on consumer trends that are staring them in the face because fund managers are old ass white dudes who could care less about what Zoomers are wearing. This market inefficiency is easily exploited if you just walk around college campuses and big cities and pay attention. This is why I've made racks off Abercrombie & Fitch and Crocs while Wall Street and you basement dwellers could only scratch your heads as to why Tik Tok Americans are buying this crap.

I come to you with this next fashion trade: a quintessential American brand focused on old WASPy aesthetics and aspirational wealth made available to the average consumer. For a long time, RL was languishing as the only people buying their gaudy sportwear were software engineers and sysadmins who wear too much cologne. Finally, this brand has leaned into its classic and refined designs and is appealing to a new base of consumers who are conscious of fashion brands ripping them off with poor quality design and materials. Zoomers grow tired of their Shein hauls lasting 4-5 wears before falling apart and are now seeking quality. For this they turn to RL. [The Polo Bear](https://www.tiktok.com/@the_real_lin_shady/video/7337744810003975466?q=polo%20bear&t=1719855313784) and [American Flag](https://www.tiktok.com/@lindigoff/video/7247314494374890794?q=ralph%20lauren%20flag&t=1719855347065) sweaters have taken off in recent quarters, and their newly launched [Olympics merch](https://www.ralphlauren.com/women-clothing-sweaters/team-usa-graphic-cotton-sweater/0077505337.html?utm_source=CSE&utm_medium=GooglePLA__21396036850_&utm_source=CSE&utm_medium=GooglePLA__21396036850_&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwp4m0BhBAEiwAsdc4aPScu0NhB1xCuOjCCJRfBT1kh_GxKqOrM3gELc3rwJ1dELvEbSYo9hoCZqMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) will continue propelling the brand forward.

# Why 🌈🐻 Are Wrong

Following Nike's disastrous earnings RL has continued a downward trend from ATH finding support at \~$170. Many assume that RL trades in the same group as companies like NKE and LULU, these are all luxury fashion brands of course, but RL is positioned differently. Athleisure is dead. If you walk around big cities like New York, regardless of time of day, fewer women are wearing the full LULU yoga set. The market for athleisure is saturated and being disrupted by cheap brands like Alo and Shein. Another trend fund managers fail to understand is Return to Office Fashion. You have an entire generation of young women who have never had a real job - and if they did it was a remote internship during the scamdemic - now asking on Tik Tok: ""How do I dress for the office""? [Ralph is a favorite brand](https://www.tiktok.com/@sx.ash/video/7324422099257347360?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7340732515428959790) for these [office girlies](https://www.tiktok.com/@mrsinkeduk/video/7314567769750523168?q=Ralph%20Lauren%20office&t=1719855177692) still figuring out what they're to be wearing. NKE and LULU make fund managers think that the American consumer is faltering, but this is not the case. They are simply terrible at managing trends. Look at Nike's product offerings. The [Adidas Samba](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidas.com%2Fus%2Fsamba-og-shoes%2FB75806.html&psig=AOvVaw0q5eapOvTD7lqAqoakYuB-&ust=1719941639846000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBEQjRxqFwoTCOD42YSwhocDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) is the hottest sneaker right now for young men and women, coming off of the dominance of New Balance's suede casual sneakers. Nike makes only 1 or 2 sneakers ([Killshot](https://www.nike.com/t/killshot-2-womens-shoes-3z3Nnb/FZ5630-100) and Cortez) that have this classic casual, white leather look that consumers are looking for. Instead they focus only on athleisure and workout segments rather than fashion.

# Consumer Trends

In fashion, all of these mid level mall brands are trying to reposition themselves as ""luxury"" for the simple reason that they can charge more for each garment. However, many are doing this wrong. They are selling the same plastic crap for higher prices with more marketing. This has not been working great for Zara, Uniqlo, H&M, and others. This has worked out very well for Abercrombie & Fitch, Wall Street's current fashion darling, A&F has pivoted to selling clothes that are on trend with minimal branding and a commitment to quality. [A $50 shirt from A&F](https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us/p/long-sleeve-rugby-polo-53491348?seq=01&source=googleshopping&cmp=PLA:EVG:20:A:D:US:X:GGL:X:SHOP:X:X:X:X:x:A%26F+Adults_Google_Shopping_PLA_US_Tops_All+products_PRODUCT_GROUP&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwp4m0BhBAEiwAsdc4aKoAbCRC5Ox_imUloA2HQ9JoIj4d8l92rJcS5INAYK3sD6vmshmrZxoCpo0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) uses high quality cotton that you can feel will last while Uniqlo keeps trying to market its $50 polyester shirts as ""office tech wear"" or some crap. RL is uniquely positioned with its brand placement historically to offer high quality items for high prices, and the consumer knows these garments will last for years. In addition, these looks are ""classic Americana"" and won't go out of style as quickly as these [Shein microtrends](https://www.tiktok.com/@catyaps/video/7353318659533622570?q=microtrends&t=1719855637194). The consumer has more confidence buying an RL garment that they are getting their money's worth for a quality garment.

I mentioned that walking around New York City you do not see athleisure, but you do see RL's biggest sellers everywhere. Gay guys love the Polo Bear: wearing it on sweaters and tshirts. Women love the American Flag sweater as an ""Old Money Fashion"" statement piece. I frequently see dupes from[ Shein or other Chinese crap](https://us.shein.com/American-Flag-Pattern-Drop-Shoulder-Sweater-p-21875906-cat-1734.html) companies of the American Flag sweater. This is probably bearish, but imitation is the highest form of flattery I guess? The trend is growing and has staying power if other companies want to swoop in.

Off the backs of these trendy items, RL has recently launched its Olympics Team USA collection which incorporates many designs from the brand's classic Americana past. This is already generating [social media buzz](https://x.com/fetacheesepls/status/1807467583035089004), and as we approach the Olympics this will create brand momentum. The opening ceremony and the team's clothing will likely generate additional buzz. We are 25 days out from the Olympics, this should be a great window to build a short term trade with the stock currently at support.

# Fundamentals

For a quick look at fundamentals, let's do a Peer comparison:

|Ticker|PE|TEV/EBIDTA|Debt/EBITDA|Gross Margin PCT|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|LULU|24.0|11.9|0.5|58.3%|
|NKE|20.2|14.0|1.5|44.6%|
|LEVI|53.6|8.2|2.0|58.0%|
|ANF|22.2|8.1|0.9|64.1%|
|**RL**|**18.0**|**7.2**|**1.6**|**66.8%**|

As we can see, RL is a leader among its peers in margin while trading at a discount relative to some of the biggest players in the space. RL carries some higher debt levels, but for a brand with this kind of momentum it is good to see them investing in current trends. This will pay off long term. If RL were trading at the median PE of its peer group the stock would see a 27% gain. If it were trading at median Price/Revenue we would see a 22% gain. My long term price target for RL is thus a 25% gain putting us at about $212/share.

A quick look at the balance sheet. EPS is up 28% YoY with Revenue mostly flat at 2.9% increase YoY. Interestingly, the street estimates that 2025 Revenue will only increase 2.35%. I believe analysts are missing the trend and growing momentum behind RL. Increased sales volume will lead a surge in revenue growth, and assuming margin improvements persist you will see a much greater increase in EPS.

# Technicals

https://preview.redd.it/u2olfdnx3y9d1.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f3ed3329f935ac14abfa193a34433eae15d15fb

For a quick look at technicals, RL's monster earnings in February broke them out of a long term channel and price has been volatile since. The earnings pump sold off only to pump on their earnings again in late May. The stock is finding support at a long term Fibonacci level around $170. Momentum looks shit right now, it is on the lower end of the bollinger bands and looking oversold on the stochastic. I'm looking to buy around the $170 Fibonacci and psychological support and will continue to buy down to $160.

It’s been on a relentless downward streak for 6 months straight, with almost no rebounds. 

Contrast this with McDonalds, which has been on a relentless upward streak for the past 10 years (with the exception of the past 6 months, which also has been trending down). 

Is this the beginning of the end of Jack In The Box?

Or is there some other reason(s) why JACK has been performing so poorly?

1dsyyae,2024-07-01 17:36:46,Why SPX Could Hit 6000 by Year-En,"There's an interesting seasonal pattern with the SPX. In the second half of the year, the index tends to rise more frequently and significantly than in the first half.

Moreover, if there was a notable increase in the first half, like the 14.48% this year, growth in the second half is almost inevitable.

If we plot the second half's performance on the trend line—that is, the line that minimizes the distance from all points on the chart—we can expect an additional +10%, with a very narrow range of possible values.

The low dispersion intrigued me the most. It almost rules out the possibility of ending the year below 5600, and more likely points to a level closer to 6000

1dsx2pn,2024-07-01 16:19:16,HIMS GLP user forecast ,"Taking a look at current subscriber base of HIMS -  which is about 1.6MM 

For a hypo - let’s say 10% of their sub base decides to go on GLP’s 

So we have 160k using GLP’s via HIMS at 1.99 a month. 

1.99 X 12 X 160000 = 380MM 

This does not factor in new subscribers coming into HIMS and signing up for GLP’s
( who knows what that number might be ) 

This also does not factor in new subscribers choosing other products like dick pills or hair loss and seeing HIMS as a one stop shop for bone dogs, losing some weight and getting some hair - 

Currently HIMS forecasted to do about 1.2BB for 2024 and be in the black a couple hundred million 

If they come out and say the growth rate is even at this level how does this stock not go parabolic ? Do we really think at that point HIMS continues to trade at 3x sales give or take ?

There are over 100MM people who are obese in the USA ( that’s probably on the light side ) 

So we are basically asking for less than .2% of 1% of obese people in the USA to sign up for a product that is 80% cheaper than WEGOVY  ? 

I believe we are going to see some seriously explosive numbers that take this stock parabolic.  This name is mispriced for maybe the CEO and his comments , that short report, people saying there is no Moat and all that. 

But when you blow your numbers out and show that type of bottom line growth that all gets thrown out 

This is my favorite 2nd half of year stock play

1dsp82e,2024-07-01 09:59:21,Nvidia: Not a Darling Anymore,"Nvidia after briefly reaching #1 spot by market cap has fallen.

Last week was full of news of Hedge funds and institutional buyers triming their portfolio fearing the stock has risen too rapidly.

Even the annual share holder meeting on 26th June failed to restore the moment and the stock continued to languish at sub 130$ levels.

Some have put blame on Q3 [supposedly a quarter for poor returns for tech stock] while others have pointed out to investor fatigue with the stock.

This morning [1st July], Nvda is down 2% in pre-market and threatening to drop below pre-split levels.

Technical traders have pointed to a gap at 95-99$ that is yet to be filled. 

What to do? 

While Nvidia remains a dominant player in the AI/GPU segment, current softness in the stock and Nasdaq in general allows for some bearish play:

1) Buy Bear Put Spread: 
     Buy 121$ Put
     Sell 120$ Put
With 12th July expiry

2) Sell Bear Call Spread
     Sell 125$ Call
     Buy 126$ Call

Also, in August, Musk said he will launch Tesla Taxi on August 8, and the autonomous hardware uses NVDA. Jensen said that Tesla is very advanced in self driving.

PS: this is not a joke - NVDA was recommended to me in 2018 by a real autistic man, wearing a long scarf, who went around the coffee shop telling people nearby to 'buy NVDA to ensure your retirement' he also said not to invest your life savings into it though; he bought in at 70 pre pre split.

With price targets averaged at $53.86 with a “Strong Buy” rating, currently, DKNG is UNDERVALUED BY 44%. On top of this, the RSI is sitting at 41, almost OVERSOLD, and the MacD is at -0.15. This typically shows downward momentum, but these also often indicate a strong reversal in stock direction is approaching. 

Draftkings also has great financials, reporting a 57% YOY revenue increase, according to the quarter ending March 31, with projected 31-36% YOY  growth in revenue for fiscal year 2024. 

Despite this, the short interest in DraftKings (DKNG) has risen by 26.69% since its last report, with 21.32 million shares sold short, which is 4.51% of all regular shares available for trading. And I know short interest is a shot in the dark, but it definitely means something in situations like this where a strong stock is already 50% undervalued and hasn’t even hit it’s most popular season yet. 

With all of this considered, I believe DKNG is a STRONG investment, and specifically September (when NFL season begins) calls may be an absolute banger for most.

1dshht2,2024-07-01 01:53:30,Nvidia Just Getting Started: Stock Heading to $150 and Possibly $200 by year’s end,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. 

AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical.

Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.

Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger.

That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution.

Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

Overall, this is likely just the initial first stage - not the end - of Nvidia’s growth story.",1036,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dshht2/nvidia_just_getting_started_stock_heading_to_150/,wallstreetbets

1ds8qu2,2024-06-30 19:00:32,Bearish about AAPL,"Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the number of companies citing “AI” in their earnings calls has exploded, with 199 S&P 500 companies mentioning it at least once in their Q1 2024 calls. However, management optimism still hasn’t translated to company profits.

Despite mentioning “AI” 40 times in its Q1 2024 earnings call, Adobe’s management predicted decelerating earnings and revenue growth of 12% and 10%, respectively, and its stock fell by 13.7% that day.

Similarly, Salesforce and Dell, which had both tripled between December 2022 and May 2024 on AI optimism, fell 18% and 15%, respectively, after their May earnings calls, with Morgan Stanley analysts noting that GenAI bookings still hadn’t improved Salesforce’s top line, while Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi asked if Dell was selling its AI servers at zero margin, noting that its $1.7 billion in server revenue didn’t boost operating profits.

While many companies are surely to profit from AI boom such as NVIDIA from chip sales and Microsoft from cloud compute, will Apple be one of them?

Much of Apples stock boom has been around its AI hype. However, it’s still yet to see how this translates into more iPhone sales or higher profitability for the company? Are they planning to offer AI as an add-on like Samsung? There’s also the question of public’s perception of privacy concerns. 

Thoughts?

1ds7hjz,2024-06-30 18:04:45,what are your projections for TSLA 8/24/24?,"The concept of robotaxis, particularly spearheaded by a company like Tesla, holds promising prospects:

Accessibility: Robotaxis could provide a reliable transportation option for those who cannot afford a personal vehicle. This can significantly enhance mobility for people in lower-income brackets, the elderly, and those with disabilities.

Cost Efficiency: Autonomous vehicles can operate around the clock without the need for a human driver, reducing operational costs. This could result in more affordable ride-hailing services, making transportation more economical for everyone.

Traffic and Emissions Reduction: Autonomous vehicles can optimize routes and improve traffic flow, potentially reducing congestion. With a fleet of electric robotaxis, the overall emissions could decrease, contributing to cleaner air in urban areas.

Safety Improvements: AI-driven vehicles have the potential to reduce accidents caused by error. Enhanced safety features and constant monitoring can make roads safer for all users.

Urban Planning and Infrastructure: Widespread adoption of robotaxis could influence urban planning. Cities might repurpose parking spaces for green areas, pedestrian zones, or other community uses, as the need for personal vehicle ownership decreases.

Economic Impact: The development and deployment of robotaxis can create new job opportunities in tech, maintenance, and infrastructure development, while also potentially displacing traditional driving jobs. This shift will require new training and adaptation in the workforce.

Environmental Benefits: As Tesla's fleet is electric, robotaxis will likely reduce the dependency on fossil fuels, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change.

Socioeconomic Impact: By providing affordable and efficient transportation, robotaxis can help bridge the mobility gap, enabling people from various socioeconomic backgrounds to access better job opportunities, education, and healthcare.

Tesla's leadership in AI and autonomous driving technology positions it well to drive this change. The company's existing infrastructure, extensive research, and development in AI and energy storage solutions provide a strong foundation for the successful implementation of robotaxis. If Tesla's robotaxi service can overcome regulatory and technical challenges, it has the potential to transform the transportation landscape significantly",0,0.47,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ds7hjz/what_are_your_projections_for_tsla_82424/,wallstreetbets
1ds6706,2024-06-30 17:05:42,ASTS,"AST D2D 5G technology is ready to enhance the telecommunications industry. This will commence at the end of Sept when they launch 5 sats - BB1s. 5 sats which will provide 125 milly revs next year and already have AST EBIDTA break even purportedly. The plan is to produce 4 sats per month next year and beyond. Approx 100 sats are needed to be fully operational. 

AST has superior tech to any pretenders trying to get into the space and they will have no competitor for years. Their tech is patented and took them many years to establish. Starlink tend to be who people fear the most re competition. There is a misconception that Starlink are ahead of the game with anything to do with space based communication services. Starlink are largely in a diff lane - broadband and have yet to show that they will be a real competitor at all in the D2D 5G space. Even in their main area of focus, broadband, their tech is expensive and clunky - requiring a receiver for functionality. They’ve literally just announced in the last year or two that they’re going to get involved in the D2D space. How many years behind AST are they? Maybe 5? Maybe more?…

AST have MOU’s with over 50 MNO’s including Vodafone and Rakuten. They have recently signed commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon, as well as received strategic funding from both companies. This is what led to a recent share price surge as the sole remaining short thesis - funding risks/dilution - was invalidated. Furthermore, AST are set to dominate the US market with AT&T and Verizon on board. Imo it seems likely T-Mobile, who have a relationship with Starlink, will have to follow suit because Starlink have no service to offer them and won’t for many years, if ever. The scant short thesis has now evaporated and they have started to cover - as seen by a 30% or so reduction in short interest over the last month. AST have said there will be no more dilution this year. It seems there will be no more public offerings full stop going forward as AST have 50 MNO’s yet to formalise commercial agreements with - many of whom will provide strategic investment/funding via revenue prepayment and convertible loans. 

AT&T recently said that they surveyed their subscribers and 30-40% said they would sign up to AST’s service when available. AST have access to 2.8 billion users through existing agreements with MNO’s. If we assume even a pessimistic take up of 20% (not the 30-40% AT&T mentioned) then that would be 560 million yearly users of ASTS. This is not including users who are currently in dead zones of many parts of Asia, Africa, South America who currently have no phones (as there are no telecom poles/companies providing signal - a problem which AST will solve). It also doesn’t include governmental/DoD contracts or the use of day passes. 

So to give you an idea of revenue potential: 

We don’t know how much AST will charge users for the service. We do know it will be cheap and accessible. The cheapest possible it will be is $2 ($1 to Ast and 1$ to MNO). I believe it will be double that. However I want to show you revenue potential with the most pessimistic of uptake/price.

So pessimistically we will have 560 mill users (remember this doesn’t include dead zone users, governmental contracts, day passes and it is a pessimistic 20% uptake). AST will pessimistically be getting $1 dollar per month form each user or $12 yearly (I believe it will be at least 1.5 times more than that, maybe twice as much). So 560X12 = revenue of 6.7 billion with net profit of around 5 billion due to high margins. With a conservative 25 PE that with mean a market cap of 125 billion. Again, even allowing for a pessimistic 10% more dilution this would equate to a share price of 420 when fully operational. They should be fully operational by 2028. So doing the maths as pessimistically as possible I get a 420 share price. While this share price may sound crazy, considering ASTS is currently 11.50 per share or so, it’s really not. Transhumanica have a 500 PT by 2030 and Deutsche Bank have a PT of 676 by 2027. Have you ever seen a firm slap a 60x PT on a stock?

A small-time rookie here. I'm looking for a long-term investment opportunity (3-4 years at least) that promises solid gains. While I aim to maintain a diverse portfolio, I'm considering allocating a substantial portion of my capital to a single company.

One company on my radar is Boeing.

The demand for air travel is hitting record numbers.

With the public scrutiny over safety issues and the recent leadership shakeup, I'm hopeful that these problems will be resolved and Boeing's stock will return to pre-pandemic levels, offering a substantial gain.

**Abstract:** This paper explores the pervasive presence of fractal and chaotic patterns in everyday objects and natural phenomena, drawing parallels with their manifestation in financial market dynamics. By elucidating how patterns observed in crumpled fabric, tree branches, and mountain ranges mirror those seen in stock market charts, this study unveils underlying principles that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. Understanding these connections not only enriches our theoretical frameworks of complexity and order but also holds profound implications for predictive modeling and strategic decision-making in financial markets.

**Introduction:** Patterns are fundamental to both natural systems and human-made constructs, influencing perception and predictive analytics across disciplines. In financial markets, identifying and interpreting patterns such as trend reversals, breakouts, and support-resistance levels is crucial for informed decision-making. Conversely, observations of fractal geometry and chaotic dynamics in everyday phenomena suggest a deeper coherence and underlying order that may inform novel insights in investment strategies.

**Literature Review:** Synthesizing seminal works from mathematics, physics, ecology, and finance, this review establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding fractal and chaotic patterns across diverse domains. Key concepts include self-similarity across scales, sensitivity to initial conditions, and the role of pattern recognition in human cognition and decision-making processes. By contextualizing these concepts within the realms of financial markets and natural phenomena, this review sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration into their interconnectedness and practical implications.

**Methodology:** This study employs a multidisciplinary approach, integrating advanced computational algorithms with qualitative analysis to identify and quantify fractal patterns in both financial data and visual representations of natural structures. Case studies include detailed analyses of crumpled fabrics, tree line formations, and mountainous topographies, where fractal dimensions and recurrence plots highlight structural similarities with market trends. Statistical validation ensures robustness in pattern identification, facilitating actionable insights and predictive modeling applications.

**Results and Discussion:** The findings underscore striking parallels between financial market dynamics and natural phenomena, revealing how fractal and chaotic patterns manifest universally. The crumpled fabric exhibits patterns resembling trend lines with breakouts and retracements, akin to market behaviors observed in asset prices. Analogously, natural structures such as tree branches and coastlines demonstrate fractal properties mirroring market volatility and trend formations. This holistic understanding not only enriches theoretical frameworks but also positions these insights as pivotal in informing strategic decision-making and risk management strategies in financial markets.

**Conclusion:** In conclusion, this paper posits fractal and chaotic patterns as foundational elements underlying complexity and order in both natural and financial systems. By elucidating their presence in everyday phenomena, from fabric folds to geological formations, we advance our understanding of predictive analytics and strategic foresight in investment management. Embracing this interdisciplinary perspective not only fosters innovation in financial analysis but also underscores the intrinsic unity and interconnectedness of diverse systems. As we navigate the complexities of global markets, harnessing the insights derived from fractal geometry and chaotic dynamics holds transformative potential in navigating uncertainty and unlocking hidden opportunities.",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1drlf04/unveiling_the_hidden_signals_decrypting_everyday/,wallstreetbets

1drlbp9,2024-06-29 21:19:18,Albertsons (ACI) Undervalued due to merger.,"First off I know Grocery Store may be the least sexy industry ever. However, the current share price of ACI is roughly $19.75 and the merger sale price is 27.25. Assuming the merger goes through that's a 37.97% gain if the merger goes through. However, I see even more potential if the merger fails. A potential of 81.77% gain in a base case. The down side I see is the fact that the stock is probably going to slowly go down over the next few months until the merger decision goes through. There may be a slight uptick coming up on august as the merger trial begins.

Merger goes through: I think this is the less likely case and most people are assuming an incredibly 90%+ chance of the FTC denying this merger but, I think there is some fair reasoning why it might. 1) Walmart is huge. It holds so much market share the merger will still hold less than half of Walmart's market share and the merged company will be just slightly larger than Costco's market share. 2) The companies largely operate in different areas of the U.S. and have been working toward divesting certain stores where the competition would be stopped. 

Merger gets Denied: Probably more likely but, possibly the better outcome for investors. I've done a dcf and get a bear case of roughly $24, a base case of roughly $36, and a bull case of $60. I think since the merger began the company has been letting a lot of extra weight off and making the company more profitable. The companies share price is held down from the merger and the large amount of debt they took on to make the large dividend payment a year ago. The company however has shown it can handle the debt really well and are moving in a great direction.

PYPL - The pe is approaching meta level lows back in Meta's crash. Paypal isn't going anywhere. The institutions are dumping their shares and not buying any. So only retail can buy it and affect prices.

1driw2z,2024-06-29 19:25:57,Maybe this Earnings Week Could Actually be Fun - Bullish for MSM Stock,"[Lack of handle to complete inverse cup handle pattern prior to earnings.](https://preview.redd.it/c78i9s4wak9d1.png?width=1458&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b8860bfccfe05fab9f22b37b99cca498b42db05)

MSC Industrial Direct Co. distributes metalworking products and services. The company is categorized under Sector: Distribution Services. Industry: Wholesale Distributors.

**Metalworking Facing Higher Costs**

The PPI in Metalworking peaked to all time high percent change from year ago at 10% in September 2022. The YoY change has come down since then with the percent change at 4.9% for May 2024. This has decreased MSM’s gross profit dollar and margin from $411M to $388M and 43% to 42% from May 2022 to March 2024 respectively. MSM stock is down 26% from all time high back in October 2023. This high PPI is priced in the stock; the percent change from a year ago gradual decline can serve as a positive welcome for MSM moving forward as gross profit margins have started trending back upwards. [Producer Price Index by Industry: Metalworking Machinery Manufacturing (PCU3335133351) | FRED | St. Louis Fed (stlouisfed.org)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCU3335133351#0)

**Technical Analysis**

An inverse cup and handle pattern occurred during 2021 prior to October 20^(th), 2021. The earnings results were underwhelming, and the stock dropped near 5%. One can argue that there was also a head and shoulder pattern to suggest downside.

Now let’s compare to today. An inverse cup is present but without the handle and there is no clear head and shoulder pattern compared to October 2021. With the stock already down 26% the known headwinds for the company is already priced in – a slight positive nudge on the call may be enough for the stock to increase this earnings on Tuesday before market open. The stock currently sits at $78.01 which is a key price support and resistance line.

The GF Value is currently suggesting MSM is Modestly Undervalued… this is just to make me feel good.

**Potential Risks**

A) Internal and/or macroeconomic struggles.

B) I'm wrong.

C) JPOW Speech 9:30AM Tuesday.

D) All the above

Often times, equities bottom AFTER, ON RR outflows begin. This leads me to believe we have several more days of selling to ensue this week. I will be watching the ON RR data as it comes in and will likely lighten up my short positions as the outflow begins, and look for long opportunities in the market.

1drhda0,2024-06-29 18:16:21,TSLA 📈 NVDA 📉,"I firmly believe that Tesla (TSLA) has the potential to reach $250 before August, and here's why:

Historical Performance of QQQ in July: Historically, July has been a strong month for the QQQ. Given this historical trend, I expect the bullish momentum in QQQ to influence Tesla’s price movement.

Capital Rotation from NVIDIA to Other Stocks: The recent surge in NVIDIA’s stock has captured significant investor interest. As the stock market operates in cycles, I anticipate a capital rotation where investors move profits from one high-performing stock to others. With NVIDIA’s impressive rally, it’s likely that investors will take profits and seek opportunities in other promising tech stocks like Tesla. This influx of capital can drive Tesla’s stock price higher. 

Combined FOMO from Robotaxi Event, Optimus, and Earnings: Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi event, the developments around Tesla Optimus, and its earnings report are all highly anticipated. The FOMO on potentially groundbreaking announcements related to Tesla’s advancements in autonomous driving technology and the Tesla Optimus robot, combined with the anticipation of positive earnings results, can create substantial buying pressure.

I’ll keep you all updated as you tell me I’m wrong, I’ve only just started trading last month with $500, but I’ve been able to grow it pretty fast with NVIDIA puts and Tesla calls :)

1drezx2,2024-06-29 16:26:54,PYPL DD Long,"Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Everyone trades at their own risk. This is solely my personal opinion. I do not receive any compensation for this. I am positioned in PYPL. I am a retail investor.

PayPal has experienced a significant decline in its stock price in recent weeks. In this due diligence, I aim to outline my market expectations for the next two to three weeks incorporating current data.

Market Expectation and Fundamental Reasons:
A key reason for PayPal's sell-off could be increasing competition, including from Apple Pay. This may lead to intensified competition and potential market share loss for PayPal. However, PayPal and Apple Pay may cater to different target audiences. Many individuals regularly use PayPal alongside their traditional bank accounts. I certainly do. Invest in companies whose products you use.

Current Valuation:
As of June 28, 2024, PayPal's stock price was $58.03 USD. The Price-Earnings Ratio (P/E) stands at 14.58, based on Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $3.98 USD. The Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S) is 1.99 and the Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B) is 2.93. Historically, PayPal appears significantly undervalued, given the average P/E ratio of the last nine years was 44.65.

Market Sentiment and Technical Analysis:
The overall market has shown positive performance in 2024, driven particularly by the 'Mag Seven' companies. However, market breadth remains constrained, indicating many stocks are still undervalued. A sector rotation in the second half of 2024 could benefit fintechs like PayPal, especially if interest rate expectations decline and AI technology is leveraged for efficiency gains.

Technical Indicators and Sentiment:
PayPal's Dealer Gamma Exposure (GEX) recently stood at -30, coupled with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicating an oversold market sentiment. Bullish divergence within the overarching bearish scenario suggests a possible bottom formation. Support zones in the technical picture reinforce this assumption. Historically, July has been an attractive month for PayPal with high returns. A near-panic sell-off could reverse sharply due to Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). A rapid upward movement.

The negative GEX could, in a highly unlikely scenario, catalyze a small Gamma Squeeze.

Volatility and Short Interest:
Volatility, as measured by the VIX, has decreased, interpreted as a bullish signal because it could possibly drop further. PYPL's volatility has also significantly decreased. Short interest for PayPal stands at approximately 2% of outstanding shares, relatively low, indicating moderate investor confidence. Open interest of put-call options also shows a relatively balanced positioning.

In summary, the analysis suggests PayPal has promising prospects despite short-term challenges. Fundamental and technical indicators support the belief that PayPal could see positive developments, particularly in July and throughout the year.

I anticipate broader market increases and sector rotations. Undervalued stocks are likely to gain momentum. Therefore, I am LONG on PYPL.",21,0.64,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1drezx2/pypl_dd_long/,wallstreetbets
1drecmg,2024-06-29 15:57:28,Why I’m short TSLA and you should be too,"First their delivery numbers for Q3 will be lower than expectations, signaling continuing falling demand. This is after the price cuts, low interest rate offerings, and discounts. Demand just isn’t there and they do not have enough time to turn things around.


Margins keep getting tighter and tighter, falling to levels similar to other automotive companies. “But but FSD and robotaxi”. FSD hasn’t had the perceived success they thought it would have - people just like driving their cars and the extra value isn’t there for the normal person. Robotaxi won’t be ready this year, I’d be surprised if it’s ready next year - this is the most obvious sell the news out there, especially based on Tesla’s track record of over-promising and hyping things up. 


They currently have nothing in their financials but “hope” that signals a turnaround. Fundamentals clearly show TSLA is overpriced and I expect a tank in the near term. Oh and once the Delaware judge validates the attorney fees Tesla will have to pay those attorneys in billions worth of options which will almost assuredly be sold. Good luck to TSLA bulls but things aren’t looking good.

The TLDR version is up till now courts would turn to federal regulators that could ""interpret"" ambiguous language however they wanted, essentially ""making up laws"". This is why, for example, the SEC can regulate crypto despite there being no clear-cut legislation. After this ruling, federal judges now have all the power, the regulators are cucked.

This feels like uncharted territory. Definitely going to have long lasting and far reaching implications for markets. Our entire legal system just changed overnight.

Smells bullish to me. Less regulation means more innovation. It also means your breakfast cereal will probably give you cancer. Exciting times ahead.

On Thursday, in the deep, deep shadows of everything else, that has happened during the debate and and the discussion about it, that idea died a quiet and lonely death.

If the assessment of DJT being a meme stock and riding the waves of confidence in Donald Trump held up, DJT should have gone through the roof. Instead, while there were small spikes, representing how much positive sentiment was present in the share price, the stock started sliding over Friday, once more sheddding a lot of it´s superfluous value over the course of a single day.

As far as the idea of meme stocks go, this is a red flag, big enough to cover a May Parade in Moscow, while Paul Revere is galloping off and the beacons of Gondor are lit.

Below are some links for the news:

Bank of America's Dividend Increase press release

[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bank-of-america-comments-on-stress-test-results-plans-to-increase-quarterly-dividend-8-to-0-26-per-share-302186062.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bank-of-america-comments-on-stress-test-results-plans-to-increase-quarterly-dividend-8-to-0-26-per-share-302186062.html)

Bank of America's  will offer Structured Financial products on Wells Fargo stock, with a 10% annual yield.

Bank of America will check Well's Fargo's closing price on July 05 2024 to determine the reference price.

|| || |October 7, 2024|| |January 6, 2025|| |April 7, 2025|| |July 7, 2025|| |October 6, 2025|| |January 5, 2026|| |April 6, 2026|| |July 6, 2026|| |October 5, 2026|| |January 5, 2027|| |April 5, 2027|

If the closing price of Wells Fargo stock is below 44-46 per share on any of the above dates, the bond will be liquidated for a 100% loss. All coupon payments made prior to the liquidation will not be affected. If the price finishes above the July 05 2024 closing price on any of the above dates, the bond will be redeemed early and no further coupon payments will be made.

All of the above days are a Monday :)

Knowing that these rich people will try to earn the maximum return on these bonds,  They will likely attempt to keep the price below 60 on Wells Fargo stock on the dates above, and just above 44-46 to avoid liquidation.

Bank of America will offer structured products for the S&P 500 index. The bond holder either gets a 13% return if the price of the index is higher than the reference price at maturity or their money back.

1dquwa9,2024-06-28 21:33:41,Infinite Money?????,"# The Plan: December 2026 Options

Options in Play:

1. Long Call: Buy the 18th Dec 2026 $540 Call
2. Short Call: Sell the 18th Dec 2026 $545 Call

# Why This Should Work

SPY's Historical Performance: SPY has a strong track record of growth. By 2026, there's a high probability that SPY will be well above our target price, especially given its historical resilience and growth patterns.

Break-Even Point**:** We set the break-even point just $1 above the current price. This is a conservative estimate, giving us a wide margin for profit.

# The Strategy: Call Debit Spread

By using a call debit spread, we can minimize our initial outlay while maximizing potential profits. Here's how:

1. Buy the $540 Call (Long Call)**:** This gives us the right to buy SPY at $540 by Dec 2026.
2. Sell the $545 Call (Short Call)**:** This obligates us to sell SPY at $545, capping our maximum profit but also reducing our initial cost.

# Final Thoughts

This strategy hinges on SPY's continued upward trajectory, which is a reasonable assumption given its historical performance. By setting our break-even point conservatively and leveraging a call debit spread, we can potentially unlock significant profits with a controlled risk. I also understand for this strategy to be effective; you would need to invest a considerably large capital to make some serious profit.

1dqub5d,2024-06-28 21:07:44,BYND is about to go BYND the moon.,"Remember when this stock ran up like 90 percent last earnings??? It wasn't because of the earnings... it was this.

Beyond Meat (BYND) is getting ATTACKED by shorts with a MASSIVE 39%+ short interest on its float. But guess what? On June 27th, BYND made its epic entrance onto the REGSHO INCLUSION LIST 🚀💥 and you know what that means... MOON TIME!

**What's regsho?** Glad you asked! According to Rule 203(c)(6) of Regulation SHO, a ""threshold security"" means:
- Fails to deliver 10,000+ shares for 5 straight days
- Fails equal to at least 0.5% of total shares outstanding
- Security is listed by a self-regulatory organization (SRO)

Basically, it's a list of heavily shorted stocks that need to cover their butts! 😜 When BYND is on regsho, shorting is like trying to wrestle a bear in a phone booth. Liquidity is tight and borrowing costs are THROUGH THE ROOF (IBKR’s retail fee is a whopping 111.7216%! 🤑). Even the big boys are paying around 15-20%, which is INSANE.

Now, here’s the JUICY part: after 13 trading days (T+13) on regsho, forced covering kicks in. That means shorts have to start buying back shares, which can send the price SKYROCKETING. 🚀📈

Check this out: On Feb 7th, BYND hit regsho and leading up to T+13, the stock’s price climbed and CLIMBED, until BOOM 💥💥 they covered their shorts and the price went nuts! Happened again on Apr 25th – stock price up, up, and AWAY until the shorts HAD to cover, causing another HUGE pump. 💣💥

Fast forward to NOW: BYND hit regsho on June 27th and history tells us this baby’s got some big moves coming. Sure, they might not pump exactly on T+13, but they gotta cover eventually. We've seen it take up to a month before, but the trend is clear: regsho = PRICE EXPLOSION! 💥💰

My positions? 8c July 19th, 9c July 19th, 10c Aug 16th, 12c Aug 16th. This is the regsho cash cow cycle, folks. Milk it responsibly 🥛. 

**TLDR:** BYND is on regsho, and this usually leads to HUGE price jumps. Get ready for LIFTOFF! 🚀🚀

1dqsdlb,2024-06-28 19:43:40,BYND Regsho Cash Cow Cycle,"Beyond Meat (BYND) is a heavily shorted company as many of you are aware with a high short interest of 39%+ its float.

On the start of June 27 th trading day BYND entered the regsho inclusion list where the stock has huge price increases on regsho.

What is regsho?

As defined in Rule 203(c)(6) of Regulation SHO, a “threshold security” is any equity security of any issuer that is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, or that is required to file reports under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (commonly referred to as reporting securities), where, for five consecutive settlement days:

 There are aggregate fails to deliver at a registered clearing agency of 10,000 shares or more per security;

 The level of fails is equal to at least one-half of one percent of the issuer’s total shares outstanding; and

 The security is included on a list published by a self-regulatory organization (SRO).

A security ceases to be a threshold security if it does not exceed the specified level of fails for five consecutive settlement days.

A security can be added on this because the failures to settle can be a sign of high shorting and improper naked short selling as you can see from the stock’s high short interest.

When BYND is on regsho it is extremely hard to short with limited liquidity and the high cost to borrow rate (IBKR’s retail fee

currently at 111.7216%), there is also a prime rate but that’s for the bigger players probably around 15-20% which is extremely high regardless. This can lead to an increase in the price of BYND.

After T+13 (13 trading days after its been included to the list) force covering begins where they are forced to cover the amount on the first day of regsho inclusion until the stock is off regsho.

The last two times BYND has been on Regsho the shorts ran the stock up on t+13 th day.

[BYND Chart and regsho trading days](https://preview.redd.it/lce8w2oo8d9d1.png?width=1777&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc37f1671f306c73c0986791d6c8a54739857199)

As you can see on feb7th BYND entered regsho (see teal lines on chart) and leading up to t+13 the stock’s price gradually increased and the t+13 th day they decided to cover all their obligations which lead to a huge pump.

This happened to be also the earnings day of bynd where they decided to use earnings as a cover.

FC on the chart stands for forced covering where they have to force cover their obligations.

FC +1 means they have to cover whats due on the first day of regsho.

FC +2 means they have to cover what’s due on the 2 nd day of regsho. Etc.

Fast forward to the last time BYND was on regsho on Apr25th (see purple lines on chart). Again the stock’s price increased leading to the t+13 th day of regsho where on the t+13 th day they covered majority of their obligations which lead to the huge pump

Now BYND has entered regsho on June 27 th where the regsho just about started. In the past this has lead to a huge priceincrease in the stock as the shorts are now incentivized to get off the regsho list by covering their obligations. Mind you they might not run the stock up on the t+13 th trading day, it could be earlier or later where they wait for earnings on Aug 1st or after it. Also the November regsho run it took 1month for them to run it up

So we got BYND on regsho and ETF FTDs that are coming due.

My Positions are: 8c July 19th , 9c July 19th , 10c Aug16th, 12c Aug16th

This is a regsho cash cow cycle. Milk responsibly.

Also this is not financial advice.

TLDR: BYND is on regsho and when on regsho it has lead to huge price improvements.",42,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dqsdlb/bynd_regsho_cash_cow_cycle/,wallstreetbets

1dqo9s8,2024-06-28 16:48:00,"Five Below Shares & Leaps - You Don't ""Need Them"" But You Want Them!","TLDR; Five Below (FIVE) is down 40% on the year but it’s a hit with it’s core market, has executed well on store expansion (+70% store count in 5 years, including over Covid), and all negativity (Sometimes people steal stuff, TikTok is trendy) has been priced in. One opened in my neighborhood 6 months ago and everyone (kids, friends, grandparents, little league coaches, gang of ebike teens) loves the place. Long on Shares & Leaps.

**Tween & Teen Powered Growth**:

Five Below has a “unique focus on Teen and Tween” customers. Store locations align to this as well as their product offering. 

This place is nailing it. In our neighborhood using “we can go to Five Below” has become a reward dangled in front of children for great behavior, youth sport events, and general kid bribery. It's clear their offering hits on this with less expensive trendy products (think unbranded Stanley Mugs, Prime drinks, and popular character licensed gear). I love this place for the ability to get useful items but not break the bank. What used to be designate as a trip to Target has shifted to Five instead where we spend a fraction of the cost, get effectively the same things, and don’t have to walk past dozens of irrelevant departments.

While the offering is a unique focus that helps them build brand and drive store expansion, there is a ton of opportunity left on the table to cater to others in the family. Dollar stores also are hot for being recession proof.  

FIVE hasn’t even completed expansion in the US, notably they have no stores in the Pacific Northwest. Not to mention there has been no international expansion. Their expansion has come with no debt, new stores have minimal build out since fixtures are so basic and the merchandising aligns to a warehouse style clean look. The footprint works at nearly any size and they can slot into countless open leases as other retailers struggle in a downturn and are forced to close stores.

**Financials and Other DD**:

Four years ago one user wrote some great DD ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv05tm/five\_below\_going\_to\_drop\_hard\_on\_earnings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv05tm/five_below_going_to_drop_hard_on_earnings/)) and suggested buying puts since they had just made distribution center investment, couldn’t sustain store growth. Since that post they’ve grown store count by 75%, grown comparable store sales by 20% ($2.0M>$2.5M), grown EPS +144% ($2>$5+), peaked at +100% stock price ($108>$215), and are now trading at the same SAME value ($108).

There is already an approved outstanding $100M buyback that has been untouched. For a company delivering $5 EPS already it’s easy to see how a growth motivated leadership team would execute on this even if the rest of the store & revenue growth slows down. In the past few years they’ve done similar buy-backs at an average cost between $158-$162/share so no doubt they’ll be executing this and likely green lighting more.

Part of the value of Five Below is that the stores are easy to open, allowing for fast store growth. The footprint is only 9500 sq ft, which makes them easy to locate in dozens of struggling shopping areas where they can take over leases. Typically they are spending <$400k to open a store and have a one-year payback on the investment. Even after completing plans to expand to 3k stores with this model there is tons of room for new concepts of smaller or larger footprints that leverage the same distribution network they are building. Not that places like Dollar General has around 20k stores while even original WSB darlings have 6k+ stores.

50Day moving average just touched the 200day moving average

**Is it Just “$5 and Below”**:

No. The core SKU offering is based on quality low priced goods, primarily $5-$10.  That said my local store has expanded their “Five Beyond” in-store footprint to be \~25% of the square footage. There is plenty of upside to drive total $ per store up which would have a huge impact given that this metric has been flat over the past 24 months. Management has already said they expect this to drop in the short term, but this is baked into the guidance.

It’s been 5 years since “5 Below” moved to price some items over $5 and growth has still been solid. Despite the name there is no backlash to not adhering to a hard $5 cap on items and even in the face of inflation there are dozens of entry level items that will continue to be available at this price.

A big knock on the stock is that it is a physical retailer with minimal online presence. This makes sense though, even the behemoth Amazon struggles to compete in goods priced at this level. It’s nearly impossible for Amazon to make $$ on <$10 items due to shipping and the huge cost of returns. It’s a defensible fall back to have physical stores and funding a distribution network from this is a great move. Again I see this as a growth potential as they expand the price point of their offering distribution network that serves 1500+ retail locations in the continental US serves as a great basis to handle ecommerce orders reliably. 

**Risks**:

* The biggest hit to guidance came with notes about shrinkage being on the rise. This makes sense, the local store is often staffed by a single individual and tons of items are small and easy to hide. 
* Retail is a hard business. Specialty shops have their place but FIVE still has yet to show they can expand outside of trends/tweens. 
* Inventory management is hard. With store growth FIVE has better negotiating terms with suppliers, but also risks over buying trend items and having to discount them. Recent articles from Q2 earnings note difficulties here for things like Squishmallows and Faux Stanley cups (both driven by TikTok trends). Toys, Seasonal, and Trends are notorious for this but again here expanding out of just the Tween market to offer commodities for all helps reduce this risk as would a more “seek and find” approach of under buying trend items and making them foot traffic drivers with regular restocks. At the same time when other retailers over load on inventory with classic channel stuffing from manufacturers Five Below is in a position to gobble that up and resell it in their stores. Places like Ross Stores (equal store count but 10x market cap thanks to larger store foot print) have done great with this model.

1dqa3jo,2024-06-28 03:32:11,Rivian Founder in for a great deal if stocks huts 295$ per share,"2021 Equity Award to our Founder & Chief Executive Officer

In January 2021, our board of directors and stockholders approved an equity award to Dr. Scaringe consisting of a time-based option to purchase 6,785,315 shares of our Class A common stock and a performance-based option to purchase up to 20,355,946 shares of our Class A common stock (the “2021 CEO Equity Award”).

Our board of directors, in consultation with an independent compensation consultant, considered a number of factors in determining whether to grant the 2021 CEO Equity Award as well as the terms and conditions with respect thereto. Such factors include Dr. Scaringe’s then-current ownership interest in the Company, external market data for similarly situated executives among comparable companies, and the Company’s interest in incentivizing Dr. Scaringe to deliver on the Company’s strategy and align his long-term interests with those of our stockholders.

The time-based option vests in six equal installments on each of the first through sixth anniversaries of a Qualified IPO (as defined in the award agreement), subject to Dr. Scaringe’s continued service. The performance-based option vests in twelve installments contingent on the achievement of four stock price goals over a performance period that commences on the later of: (i) the sixth anniversary of the grant date and (ii) a Qualified IPO and ends upon the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The four stock price goals are, on a price-per share basis, $110, $150, $220, and $295, in each case as adjusted to reflect the impact of any stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalization or other changes in the corporate structure of the Company. Such stock prices reflect performance-based goals of approximately 5x to 13x increases in our stock price based on the $21.72 exercise price at the time of grant in January 2021.

Achievement of the stock price goals will be assessed on each of three assessment dates: the sixth, eighth and nine-year and sixth month anniversaries of the grant date.

The options each have a ten-year term and generally become exercisable as they vest. The options are also subject to certain forfeiture and accelerated vesting provisions with respect to all or a portion of the award in the event of a change of control, the definition of which does not include a public offering, termination of service to the Company and change in title from Chief Executive Officer to Executive Chairman or any other C-level title.

I just feel so defeated as I have not had a green month yet, feel like I am just getting worse. I mostly trade options, I like to use the Golden Zone for my entries. I can paper trade successfully with easy 20-30% gains, I take it to the real thing and lose it all. If I set my SL, the trade comes down hits my SL and goes right up past my TP. Whenever I don't set my SL it comes down and just keeps going down. If I avg down everything falls apart, If I don't avg down it seems to come back close to my entry, where if I did avg down would've been profitable. If I take the loss, it will just keep going past my entry. And yep you guessed it, If I don't take the loss maybe it keeps going, nope will turn around and die. I could sit here and say ""oh every time I do this the opposite happens blah blah"" but really its just my dumbass not staying patient or just being stupid and revenge trading. I have a couple trades each month that completely destroy my whole gains and eventually my port. I feel like If I keep going I am just going to eventually lose everything. I am just hoping someone else has been in this boat before and can give me some advice or just tell me the harsh reality that I can't do this, get out now. I deposit up around 1k at a time because I figure if I can work a small account I can work a bigger account, maybe just screwing myself.

Don't worry, you don't need to actually read anything or do any research to win. Just remember this: it's false info meant to manipulate the retail market into picking the opposite direction the stock is going.

**Example:** Morningstar, professionals as they are, proclaim that Nike's fair market value is $129. The average Robinhood user will see this and think to themselves, ""Oh wow, Nike is only at $94 today going into earnings... that must mean it's undervalued and about to skyrocket once efficient markets kick in... What a steal, I should buy calls or shares!"" The only problem is: Nike nosedived after earnings today, going even lower to $88 vs it's ""fair market value"" of $129.

I've done a little experiment and tracked which way earnings have gone depending on the FMV. My theory was that the stock will continue to go in the direction it's already going vs the FMV.

Here are the results of my experiment (6 for 6) -

FMV = Fair Market Value Before Earnings,
Price DBE = Price Day Before Earnings,
Price DAE = Price Day After Earnings

- Nike: FMV $129, Price DBE $94, Price DAE $88 (so far), PUTS win
- FedEx: FMV $240, Price DBE $256, Price DAE $296, CALLS win
- Broadcom: FMV $1350, Price DBE $1493, Price DAE $1678, CALLS win
- Salesforce: FMV $300, Price DBE $272, Price DAE $218, PUTS win
- Walgreens: FMV $33, Price DBE $15, Price DAE $12, PUTS win
- Lululemon: FMV $285, Price DBE $308, Price DAE $323, CALLS win

There are of course counterexamples (Micron), but from what I've seen, it's pretty uncanny and very predictable which way a stock will go based on if the FMV is below the price (it'll keep going up) or above the price (it'll keep going down). I bet someone with more time on their hands could pull these same 3 numbers for every major earnings example, and see what the percentages are of the price following this pattern.

Not financial advice; I just have basic pattern recognition and ADHD.

My next play: First Solar (FSLR) - FMV $185, PBE $250 as of today, so my position is 7/26 $285 calls. (Earnings 7/25)

1dq1vio,2024-06-27 20:53:51,DD FCX,"Due Diligence: Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)

**Executive Summary**
Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) presents a compelling investment opportunity driven by the surging demand for copper, which is a critical component in the technology and renewable energy sectors. As a leading global copper producer, FCX is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing needs of AI companies, tech startups, and the broader electrification trend.

**1. Growing Demand for Copper**

A. Technology Sector and AI Boom

- **AI and Tech Startups**: The AI boom and the proliferation of tech startups are driving significant demand for copper. Copper is essential for the manufacturing of semiconductors, wiring, and other electronic components used in AI infrastructure and devices.
- **Data Centers**: The expansion of data centers, necessary to support AI workloads, further increases copper demand for electrical wiring and cooling systems.

B. Renewable Energy and Electrification

- **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: The shift towards electric vehicles is a major copper demand driver. EVs use significantly more copper than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles due to their electric motors, batteries, and charging infrastructure.
- **Renewable Energy**: Copper is critical in renewable energy systems, such as solar panels and wind turbines, as well as in the grid infrastructure required to distribute renewable energy.

**2. Strong Production Capabilities**

A. Diversified Asset Portfolio

- **Major Mines**: FCX operates some of the largest and most productive copper mines globally, including the Grasberg mine in Indonesia and the Morenci mine in Arizona. These assets provide a robust production base and economies of scale.
- **Geographic Diversity**: The company's mining operations span across multiple geographies, reducing risk and exposure to any single region.

B. Production Expansion Plans

- **Capacity Expansion**: FCX is actively investing in expanding its production capacity to meet rising copper demand. Projects like the Grasberg underground transition are set to significantly boost output.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiency and cost management are expected to enhance profitability and cash flow.

 **3. Favorable Market Conditions**

A. Copper Price Trends

- **Price Appreciation**: Copper prices have shown a strong upward trend driven by supply constraints and increasing demand. Analysts project continued price appreciation, benefiting major producers like FCX.
- **Inflation Hedge**: Investing in copper producers can serve as a hedge against inflation, as commodity prices often rise with inflationary pressures.

B. Supply Constraints

- **Limited New Supply**: The development of new copper mines is capital-intensive and time-consuming, leading to limited new supply coming online in the near term. This supply constraint supports higher copper prices.
- **Sustainable Practices**: FCX’s commitment to sustainable and responsible mining practices positions it favorably with regulatory bodies and environmentally conscious investors.

**4. Financial Strength and Shareholder Value**

A. Strong Financial Position:

- **Revenue and Profit Growth**: FCX has demonstrated strong revenue and profit growth, driven by high copper prices and efficient production.
- **Healthy Balance Sheet**: The company maintains a robust balance sheet with manageable debt levels, providing financial stability and flexibility.

B. Shareholder Returns

- **Dividends and Buybacks**: FCX has a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Continued strong financial performance is likely to support ongoing shareholder returns.
- **Investment in Growth**: Strategic investments in expanding production and improving operational efficiency are expected to drive long-term value creation for shareholders.


**Conclusion**
Investing in Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) offers a strategic opportunity to gain exposure to the booming demand for copper driven by the AI revolution, technology advancements, and the global shift towards renewable energy. FCX’s strong production capabilities, favorable market conditions, financial strength, and commitment to shareholder value make it a compelling choice for investors seeking growth and stability in the commodities sector.


TLDR: booming AI/tech needs copper. These markets keep growing so more copper needed. FCX produces a lot of copper.

Added benefit it is also used a lot in the market of renewable energy which is also getting a lot of support. Getting in this business is also costly to set up so they kind of have a moat built up through that.

1dq1tvz,2024-06-27 20:51:51,Carvana is getting squeezed,"A lot of people were convinced, and are still convinced (including myself), that Carvana is a dogshit business that is overvalued and that the stock will eventually crash. There has been convincing short seller research publicized with the short sellers taking hefty positions in Carvana at much lower prices compared to where Carvana is now. Everyone has been expecting Carvana to crash back down by now but it hasn't. You see, short positions have inherent risks that long positions don't have and the risks have to be actively managed. The market has been very strong recently and short sellers as an aggregate have been suffering. Based on recent price action, it seems like short sellers are reaching capitulation and are decreasing their short positions or entirely closing them out. I think Carvana is seeing unusually strong price action because short sellers are capitulating and closing out their shorts, resulting in higher and higher prices. 

I don't have a position in Carvana yet. I don't blindly short stocks without a catalyst in mind or some other way that I can determine if I'm right or wrong. If the market continues to be very strong, Carvana might continue to squeeze further. It's heavily shorted with the shorts being significantly underwater. One thing that should kill the squeeze is massive dilution, which should happen at some point. The family that controls Carvana is also pretty shady and I wouldn't put it past them to orchestrate a squeeze, sell their own shares, and then issue massive dilution after. It's worth watching this stock right now because a materially good news release can result in further short covering, while a dilution news event should cause a prolonged stock drop.

I'm thinking about buying Walgreens (WBA) stock, but I'm not sure if it's a good move right now. Walgreens dropped by about 25% in a single day recently, and I'm curious about the reasons behind it and if it might be undervalued now.

Here's what I've found so far:
- The drop happened after Walgreens reported a 25% year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings for Q3 2024. This was due to weaker consumer demand and some impairment charges from recent acquisitions
- some analysts think Walgreens is undervalued, estimating its fair value at around $24 per share, which is about 50% higher than its current price
- Walgreens has a high dividend yield of around 8.38%, which is great for dividend lovers like me. But they did cut their quarterly dividend from $0.48 to $0.25 per share recently 
- They're trying to stabilize revenue through cost-cutting and acquisitions, like Summit Health and Village MD, which seem promising
- There are also broader economic concerns like high oil prices and interest rates that could impact their performance

Someone loaded up 500k+ July puts late day before the article was released early this morning. I'm not into conspiracy but this looks kinda fishy.

I'm pretty bullish on HIMS and GLP-1 drugs. Call Option IVs are crazy but I snatched 20 August 16 19 CALLs cuz I'm poor. I suggest doing shares if you think IV is too high and you are also bullish.

1dpyak0,2024-06-27 18:24:21,Are we approaching the end of supermarkets due to increased shrink? And is Costco membership model the way of the future?,"With Walgreens $WBA preparing to shut down hundreds more of their underperforming stores in the US. I wanted to look at shrink levels of Costco.  


One of the first articles I came by from last month lays it out pretty good so I'll just copy some of the data from there. 

https://www.businessinsider.com/how-costco-limits-retail-theft-checks-reciepts-2023-5


>Walmart, Target, Dollar Tree, and other major retailers have warned of rising theft rates plaguing stores across the US.

>But one company appears to be immune to the problem: Costco.

>The warehouse chain's chief financial officer, Richard Galanti, said Thursday that **shrinkage — or inventory losses due to theft, fraud, or other causes — was largely unchanged.**

> Galanti said the company saw a slight increase after the rollout of self-checkout three years ago, but those rates have since reverted to the longer-term trend.

> *T*arget**, meanwhile, has said its losses from shrinkage will balloon to more than **$1 billion in 2023, up $500 million over last year.** Walmart's CEO said in December that stores would close if theft didn't slow. Dollar Tree said this week that it was considering locking up more goods in stores as it faces rising shrink.

>Overall, theft helps drive about **$95 billion in losses every year for US retailers,** according to estimates by the National Retail Federation, an industry group.



Costco has personal information on every customer that goes through their door. Their products are in bulky large packages. and so on... 

Gist of the matter is that lack of shrinkage these days is a huge competitive advantage which directly translates to increased profits. The more competition's stores close the more shoppers Costco gets. They can reduce prices more if they need to or keep selling it at the same price as their competition. It looks like they've cornered the market for the time being. 

Obviously dollar stores are leeches that prey on small towns in the US and they are unlikely to be affected by this. But how can Walmart for example keep growing or even prevent loss of revenue over the next few years until perhaps this theft trend changes. 


Another player in this category is BJ's Wholesale Club. With larger potential for growth and a much lower PE ratio (less than half) I believe a combination of these two stocks will be guaranteed winners in the next few years.

bidding on 1/17/25 $5.50 CALL is currently at $1.05.

Normally I would stay the fuck away from cannabis stocks because I believe market dynamics of legalization will continue bring prices and margins down significantly. However, this stock recently took a massive pummeling after an earning reports, and I would guess many investors share a more optimistic outlook than I do.

However, I felt like I couldn't ignore a 21% 7 month out of the money call. Hitting the strike price would be beautiful, I would pocket the premium plus a 14.5% gain on the underlying stock. lthe stock has another 20% to drop before i'm starting to see losses. i figure they won't fold completely in the next 7 months though and the hit it took was just coming down from a temporary up-swing. 

what do y'all think? I know this isn't big money, about the same as buying a pound of 30% THC cannabis at a massachusetts dispensary these days. i'm assuming the optimistic options pricing are hopeful leftovers from recent highs, definitely doesn't seem like something i would find in a high volume stock.",5,0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dptk7c/anyone_care_to_help_me_analyze_this_options/,wallstreetbets

Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins.

**Growing Competition**

First off, the competition is heating up big time. 🔥 AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency. This is super important for data centers and AI applications, and it could seriously cut into Nvidia's market share. AMD is coming in hot, and Nvidia might end up feeling the burn. Then you've got Intel with their Gaudi3 GPU, which is packing some serious performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks. More people might start switching to Intel's GPUs, giving Nvidia a run for its money. Intel's Gaudi3 could be the ghost in Nvidia's machine👻​ 

**Lowered Margins**

Then there's Amazon, which is throwing its hat into the ring with custom GPUs for their EC2 instances. These GPUs are optimized for machine learning and AI, and they integrate perfectly with Amazon's cloud services. This seamless integration could mean less reliance on Nvidia's products, pushing Nvidia to cut prices to stay competitive. Lower prices mean lower margins, which isn't great for Nvidia's bottom line. Amazon could very well turn Nvidia's margins into margin call memes. 📉

Adding to the heat, TSMC is thinking about jacking up production fees for Nvidia. The chairman's plans to raise prices could eat away at Nvidia's margins even more. If TSMC hikes those fees, Nvidia might have to dig deeper into their pockets, and that could be a real pain in the margins. 💸 [Link (06/04)](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/TSMC-s-new-chairman-weighs-raising-production-fees-for-Nvidia)

So yeah, Nvidia's stock might be flying high right now, but with all this competition and pressure on margins, it might not stay that way for long. It's looking like Nvidia might be headed from tendies to tears if they can't keep up. 😂

**TL;DR**

Nvidia is trading high, but AMD, Intel, and Amazon are bringing the heat. 🔥 Competition + TSMC price hikes = potential margin squeeze. Stock might go from 🚀 to 💥 if they don't keep up. 😂

Grindr CEO George Arison has outlined plans for the location-based app will launch a new feature called ""Roam"" allowing users to temporarily place their profile in a new location ahead of a trip, in order to plan that trip.

* He also wants Grindr to connect its users to services, from restaurants to [fitness and health professionals](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/02/grindr-hires-athena-expansion), offered with a ""Grindr seal of approval.""
* ""Do you want to find a LGBTQ-friendly GP or therapist? Grindr will do that for you,"" Arison said.
* Users will also gain more options to differentiate their profiles: Someone looking for friends in a new city won't have to wade through everyone using the app for casual sex.
* The changes are being tested now in several markets and Grindr expects to launch them fully later this year.

Users have been ""hacking"" the app by inventing new uses for it --- from sourcing travel tips to monkeypox vaccines ---even though the app infrastructure itself barely changed.

* ""We're working to meet our users where they are,"" Arison said, ""We had not added any enhanced features for a number of years.""

Grindr currently around 14 million monthly active users worldwide, and a market capitalization of around $2 billion.

* Arison also said Grindr's growth markets are Latin America and Asia, but added ""In the US, almost 30% of Gen Z adults identify as queer. All of these people will need a tool for connecting with others.""

On AI:

* ""AI will fundamentally change how dating will be done, creating better ways of making connections --- and our users will decide exactly how,"" he said.
* ""We need to lead them there, through the opportunity to participate in piloting features, and giving users a clear choice of whether they want to use this technology.""

Here are is the new revenue & earnings guidance, which is conservative because it doesn't include the contributions from expansion opportunities, which is where I think the real opportunity lies.

Share buybacks? Another dividend raise? I don't fucking know - all I see is Jensen feasting on this joke of a spinach dip over the past week. Even the Wall Street regards are dropping price targets north of $170, couple at $200 already.

Jensen has said on multiple occasions now - GTC first, and the iNveStoR's meeting (regards) today - ""Blackwell will be the most successful product launch in NVDA's history"". The CoWos advanced packaging tech from TSMC increased production capacity sizably, which is starting to lead to higher than expected revenue projections for Blackwell this year. 

Then there's the GB200 set for launch in the fall.

  
Anyway, not to digress too much - my post history is entirely NVDA due diligence at this point, so see that if you need catching up on other recent NVDA announcements. 

Otherwise the read is simple enough even for regards like me after watching GTC. Especially so after he started getting asked for titty signatures.

1dpd276,2024-06-26 23:39:15,Chewy Announces $500 Million Repurchase of Shares from BC Partners,"PLANTATION, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Chewy, Inc. (NYSE: CHWY) (“Chewy” or “Company”), a trusted destination for pet parents and partners everywhere, announced today that it has agreed to repurchase an aggregate of 17,550,000 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a price per share of $28.49, which represents a 5.0% discount to yesterday’s closing price, resulting in an aggregate repurchase price of approximately $500 million (the “Repurchase”) from Buddy Chester Sub LLC, which is an entity affiliated with funds advised by BC Partners Advisors LP (“BC Partners”), Chewy’s largest shareholder. The repurchased shares will be cancelled and retired upon completion of the Repurchase.

Chewy believes today’s Repurchase is an accretive use of capital and provides an efficient mechanism to repurchase shares at a discount to the current market price, while further reducing the ownership position of the Company’s largest shareholder. Chewy’s increasing profitability and free cash flow generation enables the Company to further optimize its capital allocation strategy through this transaction, which comes in addition to the recently announced $500 million share repurchase program. This transaction together with the Company’s share repurchase program underscores the confidence Chewy has in the business and its compelling growth and margin expansion strategy. In light of Chewy’s expanding free cash flow generation, the Company will continue to assess options to opportunistically return cash to its shareholders.

The future can’t be delayed and is inevitable, You made it.
I see you are well off. I see mom and dad are taken care of. You are off the bus, driving a Black Benz. You are not working overtime mopping floors and cleaning toilets just to barely afford to rent someone’s basement.

The Universe never lied about a vision of a hungry man. You were a hungry young man in this vast universe but now, now the universe is within you. Remember this.

That’s what I gave you. I’ve set a chain of events in motion that got you here. 
Sorry to put you through the up and downs and the coarse nature of the path I set you on, but that’s the only way to reach the top - risk falling off the cliff. Bet you learned some shit. You’re welcome.
Just remember, you were here in somebody’s basement . You couldn’t afford school. You were in a foreign land, you’ve made it your home,a fish out of water, you haven’t seen your family in over a decade and counting. When you were serving at a restaurant, rich Highschool classmates acted like they don’t know you and left you $1 tip, you swallowed your tears as you wiped their table after they left. You couldn’t afford medicine for your mother. You were hungry. You cried to sleep, woke up in the morning to do a 15 hour shift. Women ignored you, old “friends” disrespected you when they saw you at the bus stop. You were lonely, your birthdays never existed, nobody made a toast to your health. Nobody invited you to Christmas, Thanksgiving or to parties. Don’t forget you wiped your tears off your phone screen as you typed this. 

But now you’re here. You’ve made it. I trust you’ve found a good woman and a great network of people who care about you and your purpose.
Now that you’re living in affluence,I hope greed didn’t consume your battered soul. Don’t forget to help others. All the opulence is vain if you are not sharing it.

1dp73qj,2024-06-26 19:23:22,"GDEV: high-growth creator of Hero Wars & PixelGun3D with an overweight $5 PT
","Here is some research I've gathered and compiled on the video game company GDEV/GDEVW and would like to share. Your feedback & commentary are most appreciated.

Disclosure: I’m long with 20 000 shares.

**TL;DR**

GDEV is one of the largest pure-play free-to-play (F2P) mobile and PC video game companies by bookings. It has a portfolio of large genre-leading franchises such as MMoRPG Hero Wars, FPS Pixel Gun 3D and puzzle game Island Hopper which position it well in a market that increasingly favours large brands and scale. Organic bookings and sales growth accelerated to +4% and +10%, respectively, in Q1 ‘24 and Q4 ‘23 representing the fastest growth of any peers. 

Record high audience expansion due to marketing efficiency with platform commission expense decreasing to a historically low level of 21.9%.  Share of the PC market has increased to 38% with 14 million Monthly Active Users (MAU) +17% year-over-year on all platforms.

Company is trading at a ridiculously cheap bargain price of 2$ at a valuation of 4x EV/EBITDA (peers 12x) and 0.5x EV/Sales (peers 1.5x) with high insider ownership.

**Cliff notes**

GDEV has three key franchises, under which it has several titles:

Hero Wars: Alliance (mobile, Hero wars: Dominion Era (PC), Island Hoppers (mobile and PC), Pixel Gun 3D (mobile and PC). GDEV has several games in development set to launch from late 2024 onwards. All franchises continue to deliver growth. 

With several growth levers at its disposal, Cantor expects GDEV to deliver mid to high single digit organic growth in 2024-2025, with potential for 10% growth, positioning GDEV with one of the highest organic growth outlooks in the peer group. As GDEV invests for growth, we believe their margins (2% EBITDA and 4% FCF in 2024) to climb to 20%-30% in the medium term. GDEV trades on a 0.5x EV/Sales versus peers on 1.5x, 4x EV/EBITDA versus peers 12x (ROVIO was bought by SEGA at 20x EV/EBITDA in 2023), with 40% of its equity value in balance sheet cash ($174m).

Cantor Fitzgerald has initiated coverage of GDEV with an outperform rating and a minimum $5 price target. They highlight that GDEV returned to positive organic bookings and revenue growth in Q4 2023 and will continue to deliver consistent positive mid to high single digit organic growth through 2024-2025 driven by robust user acquisition spending, a growing active and paying user base in existing titles and new game launches. 

Last but not least, GDEV has taken advantage of the market rout of 2023 and undergone a buy-back offer at 2$ to purchase undervalued shares which reduced its float by 17 million shares.

**Investment Thesis**

* Mobile and PC free-to-play market has stabilized after two years of declines, with growth resuming in late 2023 and Q1 24, and continuing into Q2 24.
* GDEV’s portfolio of genre-leading franchises, large user base and leading UA expertise leave it well positioned in a market that continues to favour large, established brands and scale publishers.
* Organic bookings growth accelerated to +4% in Q1 24. With several growth levers, organic growth is expected to accelerate to even 10% by FY 24-25.
* EBITDA margins will remain in the high single digit in FY 24-25 due to the investment, but long-term margins should reach 20%-30% offering material long-term profit upside
* With 40% of its market cap in cash, GDEV trades on a 0.5x EV/Sales (peers 1.5x) and has balance sheet optionality.
* The company is trading at around 4x EV/adj. EBITDA, which is way below peer valuations. It also generates decent cash flows from operations with a price target of at least 5$, an upside of 100%.

**History**

The company has certainly come a long way from its humble beginnings in 2010, which is when its founders first met. At the start of that decade, Fadeev was running a social games development studio, Progrestar, while Boris Gertsovskiy was putting the finishing touches to his plan to start a game business.

Within four years, Nexters was born and the company grew rapidly, particularly following the launch of its blockbuster title — Hero Wars — that first brought it international acclaim. However, it was the strategic decision of 2018 to scale on mobile that really powered the firm to the next level. Since then, Nexters has vastly increased its player base, revenue and team to total over 700 professionals, the bulk of them located in Cyprus.

>

GDEV is currently rated as one of the top-3 developers in Europe with **400+ millions** total game installs worldwide with hit games like Hero Wars, Pixel Gun 3D, Island Hopper and others.

[Marketing Growth Figures](https://imgur.com/mv8sJM4)

**What is Hero-Wars?**

The game follows a formula that many mobile gamers will be familiar with: it’s all about building up a team of heroes and watching them make their way through dungeons. If they’re not up to the challenge, you have to grind and enhance them, or you have to work to unlock other heroes who might be better suited to the challenge. It’s a game that’s really easy to get sucked into, filled with daily challenges that start easy and slowly become more and more difficult as you play and those who play it will soon find that it has become a part of their daily routine.

Throughout the year, Nexters has been actively engaged in its Hero Wars franchise. For example, they have divided Hero Wars into two games — the mobile Hero Wars Alliance and the browser-based Hero Wars Dominion Era. Recently they got a collaboration with Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider and have introduced Lara Croft as a character.

The company has released Hero Wars comic books and animated shorts like Rovio did with its Angry Birds franchise. Mobile games outlet Pocket Tactics included Hero Wars Alliance in selection of the best games in 2023 & 2024 and colleagues from PCGames included Hero Wars Dominion Era in selection of the 19 best browser games of the year!

**PIXEL GUN 3D on PC: The new Blockbuster**

[PixelGun3D](https://imgur.com/9sWytbj)

The PC version of Pixel Gun 3D was released on STEAM on April 2nd and it was one of the platform’s strongest game releases in a while. PG3D broke into the TOP-20 successful new releases on Steam and took first place among the best free-to-play games of April by the total number of players! It recouped all of its development costs within the first day, an unheard feat: 

* The game was launched on Steam April 2, entering on debut the Top 20 most sold and Top 50 most played games.
* The mobile version has already accumulated over $200 million in cumulative all-time bookings, while the PC version is just beginning its journey.
* The peak concurrent Steam users count reached 25,000 players on the first day of release.
* The Steam version of Pixel Gun 3D recouped its PC platform development costs within the first day of release, making 5 times the average daily in-app purchases of the mobile version.
* The results were achieved without significant marketing investments, capitalizing on strong brand awareness across the globe.
* 24k reviews on Steam estimating about 630k to 1.20m owners as of may 14th 
* The average session duration for Pixel Gun 3D on PC is an impressive 70 minutes per day, which is 3.5 times longer than on mobile devices!
* The retention rate on the first day is 30% higher than in the mobile version. What a result!

**Island Hopper and Block City Wars are upcoming blockbusters**

Highlights of Island Hopper:

* The game has made $47 million in revenue
* Over 20 million downloads to date
* Top 10 Farming Category free games (according to AppMagic data)
* Soft launched in 2021 with a global release late in 2023

There’s so much to do in this adventure game that features Emily, a distraught sister who sailed all the way to a mysterious island in search of her brother. Besides cultivating crops, you can take part in several minigames, go on thrilling camping trips, look for hidden treasures, and even try to uncover secrets of the island’s past. You will never run short of activities in Island Hoppers.

What is Block City Wars? 

It’s a reboot of the game Block City, originally released in 2016, a GTA-style open-world shooter in minecraft style for mobile platforms. This year, GDEV decided to completely overhaul the game, using all the experience gained from Pixel Gun 3D to turn Block City Wars into a world-class game. Combining a brand new approach to game design with familiar elements that made the original game popular, Block City Wars has made it into the top 10 best Roblox-like games according to PocketGamer!

[Block City Wars](https://imgur.com/evlbJEh)

First quarter 2024 highlights

* Revenue of $107 million decreased by 10% year-over-year.
* Bookings of $109 million increased by 4% year-over-year.
* Second consecutive quarter of bookings growth. 
* Loss for the period of $1 million in Q1 2024 vs. loss of $8 million in Q1 2023.
*  $129 million of available cash funds.
* Record high audience expansion due to marketing efficiency
* Share of PC platform increased to 38%
* Blended platform commission expense decreased to a historically low level of 21.9%
* 14 million Monthly Active Users (MAU) +17% year-over-year
*  Adjusted EBITDA of negative $3 million in the first quarter 2024 compared to negative $12 million in the first quarter of 2023.

>

GDEV continues to fire on all cylinders. Q1 2024 represents the second quarter of impressive bookings growth, the main metric to follow.  Lots of people still think that revenue is the most important metric in any business. for online service, the most important is bookings. 

For example you purchase an annual Microsoft Office subscription in a midyear. Microsoft includes half of this subscription payment as the revenue for this year and second half for the next year, but as a booking this payment will be reflected as a full cash inflow to the account.

In mobile/online games revenue is based on the distance the player stays in the game, that's why cash inflows or bookings are more relevant to assess the company as it's not tied with time and shows the real figures.

[Operating Highlights](https://imgur.com/6fim6Hk)

It's important to know that EBITDA is generally designed to show  the real profit of a company. By default, high EBITDA margins mean that a business can generate a lot of income from the revenue it makes, but in a free-to-play (F2P) model of the gaming industry there are several interesting nuances. 

1. Revenue: If a generous player pays say $1000 in a game today, you cannot recognize this money as revenue immediately, it has to be recognized gradually. 
2. Marketing Costs: for gaming companies marketing expenses are not just costs but investments. if a company sees an opportunity to invest more money in marketing today, it ensures revenue streams for long periods ahead, therefore significant marketing expenditures are good. 

A quite successful mobile gaming company may see  great potential in investing money in marketing, but revenue is recognized gradually while expenses are recognized immediately. As a result EBITDA is in the negative, but the company is in a positive position.

**Total addressable market**

Cantor expects the global video game market revenue growth to reaccelerate in 2025 onwards to mid-single-digit growth, with 2024 being a year of stabilisation as companies focus on restructuring their cost base after years of over-investments. They see 2025 as a stronger year in terms of new large AAA releases including GrandTheftAuto VI and new hardware launches. mobile seems to be nearing a bottom, with market data and quarterly reports from listed companies looking more positive and suggesting that market growth is resuming in 2024 before improving in 2025.

The 2% decline in the mobile games market in 2023 is an improvement from the 5% decline in 2022. encouragingly, the US was flat in 2023 and 65% of the top 20 markets were flat to very modestly up in the year, prepping for a more bullish set-up in 2025.

According to Sensor Tower’s Q1 2024 Digital Market Index, quarterly mobile game spend surpassed $20 billion for the first time in two years — it reached $20.3 billion, up 2.9% year-over-year. Player spending on iOS grew nearly 6% year-over-year to $13 billion, while consumer spend on Google Play slightly declined to $7.3 billion (-1.3%).

**Concluding remarks**

GDEV is a great company with solid financials and a bright future trading at ridiculously cheap bargain prices of 2$ at a valuation of 4x EV/EBITDA (peers 12x) and 0.5x EV/Sales (peers 1.5x) with insiders having skin in the game. The company is critically underfollowed, so I would keep a close eye on the company given the strong Q1 2024 and bouncing back into growth mode.",11,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dp73qj/gdev_highgrowth_creator_of_hero_wars_pixelgun3d/,wallstreetbets

1dp4z0m,2024-06-26 17:55:15,"Taking a closer look at the Rivian, Volkswagon partnership","Rivian Automotive (RIVN) and Volkswagen Group (VWAGY) have announced a significant joint venture that includes a substantial investment by Volkswagen in Rivian. This partnership aims to accelerate the development of software and electrical architecture for both companies, combining their strengths to lower costs per vehicle and enhance innovation on a global scale. Rivian's advanced zonal hardware design and integrated technology platform will form the foundation for this collaboration, which will benefit both automakers as they develop new vehicle models in the latter half of the decade.

Volkswagen plans to invest up to $5 billion in Rivian by 2026, starting with an initial $1 billion through an unsecured convertible note that will convert into Rivian’s common stock under certain conditions. This investment will help alleviate concerns about Rivian's financial stability, particularly given the company's recent losses and workforce reductions. The partnership will enable Volkswagen to leverage Rivian’s existing electrical architecture and software platform in the short term, while both companies aim to roll out vehicles utilizing the joint technology in the future.

First and foremost, the investment bolsters Rivian's liquidity, providing a lifeline to the startup as it navigates the challenges of scaling up production. The $7.858 billion in cash, augmented by Volkswagen's infusion, transforms the company's financial position, ensuring a solid foundation for the development of its R2 and R3 mass-market SUVs. By addressing short-term concerns, the joint venture paves the way for a more sustainable growth trajectory.The strategic benefits extend beyond capital. Rivian's cutting-edge technology, particularly its zonal hardware design and electrical architecture, becomes a valuable asset for Volkswagen. This integration accelerates both companies' software development, enabling them to create more efficient and cost-effective EV solutions. 

As a result, the partnership fosters a competitive edge, with both entities set to disrupt the mid-to-high-end segment of the market.The deal also implies a shift in market dynamics, as the collaboration signals a shift from standalone competition to a more cooperative model. Smaller EV manufacturers may feel the pressure to either enhance their own technology or explore similar strategic alliances to maintain their relevance. Legacy automakers like Volkswagen, now armed with Rivian's technology, are no longer spectators in the race for electric dominance.However, while the partnership is a game-changer, it's crucial to note that it doesn't guarantee an immediate turnaround for Rivian. The company must still execute effectively on its production optimization and cost structure improvements, as evidenced by the retooling efforts and efficiency initiatives mentioned. The future profitability of both parties will hinge on the successful integration and the ability to deliver on the promises of the joint venture.

Market reaction to the deal has been notably positive for Rivian, with its stock surging up to 50% in after-hours trading. Analysts have hailed the partnership as a game-changer, with Wedbush Securities raising its price target for Rivian's stock and highlighting the significant boost to Rivian's financial health and future prospects. Conversely, Volkswagen's stock saw a slight dip due to concerns over the size of the investment and its struggling software subsidiary Cariad.

   * CAGR to 2027 price target: \~19.51% per year

Why I think it's undervalued:

1. Conservative Guidance - Management seems to be underpromising, which could lead to overdelivering. They've consistently outperformed during earnings as well, and morning during their [investor conference](https://investors.grindr.com/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Grindr-Investor-Day-2024/default.aspx) they increased their revenue guidance for 2024 from revenue growth of at least 23% to at least 25%.
2. Debt Reduction: They should be able to pay down and refinance debt quickly with this cash flow. They've been making good progress here. [https://investors.grindr.com/files/doc\_financials/2023/q1/Grindr-Q1-2023-SHL-vF.pdf](https://investors.grindr.com/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/Grindr-Q1-2023-SHL-vF.pdf)
3. AI Potential: Their AI investments (like Wingman gen AI bot) aren't factored into guidance but could be huge.
4. Multiple Expansion: A 20x multiple is low for a company growing this fast. Any expansion could lead to significant upside.

Keep in mind: This doesn't even factor in the partnerships & ad revenue. Or the international expansion. These could make the stock worth $100

Risks to consider:

* Execution risk on new products
* Competition??

The DEA's comment period will end on July 22, 2024 essentially making rescheduling a sure thing. The reason rescheduling is so relevant to the business end of the marijuana industry is it will allow businesses involved with marijuana to write off expenses and claim deductions on their operating costs like ordinary businesses. Pot stocks have been beaten down for years and are due for a major run. I see this as well as several other major catalysts coming up that could send MSOX into double digits.

1dp033f,2024-06-26 14:33:58,Tesla Stock Price will go down over the next six months?,"Looking into Tesla, I am predicting that over the next couple of months the price Tesla stock will go down due to multiple factors. I would like to share my thoughts and see what you guys are thinking. 

1. Twitter/X is dead weight: It has been said elsewhere before but it is worth repeating that Elon buying Twitter was a mistake for everyone involved. Twitter was already an unprofitable company well before Elon took over, and his decisions have scarred off a lot of advertisers in having the space be less moderated (not to touch on the issue of how Elon being the face of Tesla has in voicing controversial opinions has made both other companies less willing to work with him as well as tarnished his image to much of the general public). It does not help Elon in any way to keep this website operating.

2. Cybertruck: The resources used to produce the Cybertruck were resources that could have been used to produce EVs that people wanted and were already buying, and or produce a next generation of electric vehicles for the general public. Less than 4,000 Cybertrucks have been sold since April and there have already been 4 recalls for the car.  

3. Tesla is facing increased competition both in places like the US as well as in China, and thus has to start a price war with a country known for selling very cheap goods.

Now. I am not saying that Tesla is doomed or that there will be a massive stock crash. But that in the next months the growth that Tesla will reverse as Tesla faces more competition, more controversy and especially with Twitter acting as an Albatross around Elon’s neck. What you are seeing now with the price increase over the last month could be some sort of short selling scheme to get people to buy Tesla Stock before it starts to come tumbling down.

Tesla isn't the only company that can survive in the space - Rivian demand is growing and they make a great vehicle. They have a strong offering so far, and with enough cash to survive, the R2 will do well and continue further growth into the R3.

Rivian's new partnership and investment with VW was inevitable, though it was uncertain which brand would partner with them.

Grindr is hosting today in New York its inaugural investor day as a public company, unveiling its plans to deliver on its mission to build the Global Gayborhood in Your Pocket. Presentations by Grindr senior management will highlight its industry-leading performance and user engagement metrics, the Company’s new product roadmap that is powered by AI, and a four-year financial outlook.

“Grindr is unique because it was built by gay people for gay people. By focusing on our users over the past 15 years, we’ve achieved tremendous loyalty and engagement from them,” said George Arison, Grindr’s Chief Executive Officer. “Throughout our investor day, we will articulate the innovation we are planning in order to make our user experience even better and drive long-term growth. We are improving connection and casual dating, which have always been core to Grindr, through a suite of features called Right Now, while also creating new AI-first features to help users more easily find long-term relationships. We know our users want additional functionality to help them better access other types of social connections and to access curated, relevant information and services that will enhance the quality of their lives. Through new product expansions, we are creating ways for users to gain these experiences in the app.”

Grindr will present a multi-year product plan to build out additional functionality in its app. This includes developing eight new products for users to engage with Grindr’s core use cases of connectivity, dating, and relationships, and Gayborhood expansion use cases, which are new partnership-based digital services typically found in physical gayborhoods. To bring this vision to life, the roadmap leverages AI in a variety of ways, including the Grindr Wingman product.

Today, Grindr is increasing its revenue guidance for 2024 from revenue growth of at least 23% to at least 25%. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2024 of at least 40% remains intact. Looking out to 2027, with the Company’s new product plans designed to support the core dating business, Grindr expects to deliver 20-25% revenue growth annually through 2027, with Adjusted EBITDA margins in the range of 39-42%. Grindr’s expanded, partnership-based, digital Gayborhood services, including travel, wellness, and entertainment experiences, are not reflected in Grindr’s revenue outlook through 2027, though modest investments in these initiatives are factored into the company’s long-term Adjusted EBITDA margins.

“Grindr has built a durable financial model that is delivering strong, reliable growth as we execute on our monetization strategy,” said Vanna Krantz, Chief Financial Officer. “Our 2024 revenue guidance increase combined with the longer-term financial targets we are announcing today demonstrate our confidence in Grindr’s continued strong revenue growth and Adjusted EBITDA profitability even as we invest prudently in our product roadmap and new use cases. We believe our plans set up Grindr for significant profitable growth, cash generation and value creation.”",25,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1doz8ap/grindr_hosts_first_investor_day_dont_miss_out_on/,wallstreetbets

1doxiyr,2024-06-26 12:35:19,RIVN going to cross $30 within days,"# Rivian Revs Up for Growth with Volkswagen Boost: A Bullish Take on RIVN Stock

Rivian (RIVN) is poised for a surge, with the recent $5 billion investment from Volkswagen acting as a major catalyst. Here's why this could push the stock towards $30 in the near future:

* **Vote of Confidence:** Volkswagen's hefty investment is a resounding endorsement of Rivian's technology and future potential. This validation from a giant automaker significantly boosts Rivian's credibility and market confidence.
* **Cash Flow Lifeline:** The $5 billion provides much-needed capital for Rivian to ramp up production and expand its reach. This financial stability allows Rivian to focus on growth without the immediate pressure of cash burn.
* **Shared Expertise:** The partnership with Volkswagen fosters a powerful knowledge exchange. Rivian gains access to Volkswagen's vast manufacturing experience, while Volkswagen benefits from Rivian's innovative EV technology. This collaboration could accelerate development and innovation for both companies.
* **EV Market Momentum:** The electric vehicle (EV) market continues its strong growth trajectory. With rising gas prices and increasing environmental concerns, consumer demand for EVs remains high. Rivian is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.
* **Short-Term Boost:** The initial surge in pre-market trading after the Volkswagen news highlights the market's positive reaction. This momentum could continue in the coming days, pushing the stock price closer to $30.

While predicting the exact stock price is inherently challenging, the Volkswagen partnership injects significant optimism into Rivian's future. With a strong tailwind and strategic collaboration, Rivian's stock price has a compelling case to reach the $30 mark within the near term.

**Important to Consider:**

The stock market is dynamic, and external factors can influence Rivian's performance. Keep an eye on overall market trends, production updates, and any potential challenges Rivian might face.

1dowoqn,2024-06-26 11:50:52,Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price.

Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then.

People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings.

**But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment.**

Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and **I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons.**

Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in.

If you are a big tech company and want the best, cutting edge silicon you will have to switch to Intel foundry sooner or later.

Investing in Intel right now is like buying NVDA stock before the AI boom. ",4049,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dowoqn/why_intel_is_the_most_undervalued_tech_stock/,wallstreetbets

1doqzvu,2024-06-26 05:30:18,"My boring, but relatively successful way to not LOSE money.","This sort of post/story isn’t new to most people in this sub, but here you go:

Started options trading approximately five years ago. I was watching my Roth, personal brokerage account, and 401k from work slowly go up. I got bored. So fucking bored. That’s kind of why we are all here, right? That and to get rich or whatever. Anyway.  Ended up blowing a few options accounts (luckily didn’t touch the 401k or Roth). Made some good money along the way, but not enough. Always wanted MOAR. Still do. 

After seeing my options gains slowly dwindle, and realizing that I was being too impulsive, I slowed down.

If you have a regular job that brings in income and aren’t relying on trading for your day-to-day expenses, this approach to options might help you to NOT LOSE money. If you’re looking to get rich quick and you’re unemployed - probs not for you.  

1. Don’t put money in your options trading account unless it’s down to zero. You’ll just end up with less money. There’s always a play, even with fifty bucks. 
2. Always withdraw when you can, and put it in your savings account. Play with house money. Unless you really want to full-time day trade, you don’t need that 25k in there. You might make more mistakes (I do, at least) when you feel like you’re “up.”
3. If you float around the ~5 to 10k amount, only buy one or two options contracts at a time. You’ll miss out on some huge gains, but you’ll not have huge losses. And along the way, in my experience, you can net $500 + a week. It seems so small compared to the gain porn posts on here, but when you withdraw that shit - nah. 
4. When you DO want to make a big play - have all your day trades available. 
5. If you can, pull some of the amounts you transfer from your brokerage to your bank out in CASH. There is something about it that helps you to remember that, yes - it is REAL money.

Reddit has 1/3 the market cap of Snap and Pinterest. Sure those companies are more mature and have much larger revenues but Reddit is soooo much a better investment. First, Reddit has no competition. Snap or Pinterest can easily get their lunch eaten by Tiktok or whatever next trendy app comes along. Meanwhile even the true regards over at r/RedditAlternatives have thrown in the towel and admit there's no alternative to Reddit. Of course reddit is never gonna compete with Insta or Tiktok due to low quality userbase (yeah I'm talking about you) and a medium less conducive to advertising. But it doesn't matter! Reddit only need to be 1/20th of meta for us to get rich.

Reddit is only gonna keep growing like the chode your wife loves so much. They got Google sending them giga traffic because of all the BS AI articles trying to game the search system. They got OpenAI about to start referencing reddit in their results. They got AI translation for their entire content to other languages for international expansion in testing.

Best part is how bad the current advertising on Reddit is. Some people say this is a negative but it's not, that's what makes this such an opportunity. I've seen how dog water Reddit ads were targeted a few years ago. Now it's merely bad. You're telling me they can't at least make it decent after a while? When communities are already separated by topic?

Half the analysts I see talk about Reddit on TV have no idea what's going on or what the site is other than it's an old school forum that's bad at selling ads. This screams opportunity, 5x is much more likely than 50%.

1dohb4s,2024-06-25 21:26:22,Nike Increase on earnings ?,"Nike's stock has taken a hit this year due to slower growth, and missed revenue in both Q1 and Q2. While Adidas  Sports and Under Armour might seem like their main rivals, their real rival is not an American company, but Chinese companies flooding the market with knockoffs. These cheap alternatives are extremely popularity for their affordability and amazing quality. You literally can not tell the difference between one of these knockouts and the real things

Recently, Chinese authorities cracked down on major counterfeit operations, including one of the biggest, PandaBuy. They raided warehouses and shut down factories, even arresting the CEO.  Not only was PandaBuy shut down, but others  just as big including one called HagoBuy. I'm assuming this crackdown left consumers scrambling, especially during important events like birthdays and celebrations.

 It’s so popular that I know people who use this site personally and were bummed out when they told me what had happened.  Sites were down and people wanted their clothing, birthdays, and celebrations were coming but where would they go?

Nike

Nike is one of the top options for teens/young adults. They have a large market share and correct me if I'm incorrect but they are the biggest by market cap. Nike is the most popular clothing store that has good clothing and is much better priced than their competitors. Their EPS forecast is relatively higher than last quarter, but I have no doubt that they will beat earnings.

There expected revenue is 12.87 Billion, which I think they will likely hit even if my thesis is wrong as they've seemed to just barely hit expectations these past 2 years, and there's no reason for them to miss earnings

This similar rational was used for me going long against Foot locker, which increased 25% in two days despite being much smaller.

Their earnings are on June 27 and I've bought 10% OTM Calls

If I'm right, I really recommend dumping your shares/options, as I'm sure fakes will start flooding the market again and Nike doesn't have what it takes in my opinion to grown exponentially over the years

This has improved all tech x1000. But what hasn't changed in 30 years? Your phone lithium ion battery. This is stopping you from being on Reddit all day at work when your phone dies. What's the solution??? ARCHITECTURE. All battery cells for 30 years are a ""jelly roll"" of cathode and anode layers rolled up into a cell. When you try to put silicon in there to expand the battery capacity the silicon swells up and breaks the battery. There are many shitco battery companies that never do anything and give the space a bad name. They are trying to fix this problem with complicated chemistry solutions. Enovix took the cathode/anode and sliced them into square layers and made a stack (like a sandwich) instead of a roll. This is the same way semi chips are made and stacked or so I'm told. They wrap it in a metal case and this structure can withstand and divert the force of any swelling of silicon. This allows >30% more capacity in a cell depending on its size. They have now replaced the whole leadership team with Qualcomm hardcore chip maker production guys and they are getting this damn factory running and shipping by next year. They are fielding sample orders from large megacap tech and phone OEMs. Today an agreement from a AR headset maker that the customer will pay for retooling to make the chips right for the headset. +30% pop today. These announcements are likely to continue IMO.    AI and LLMs and BLTs are all very power hungry to run. Apple already says they want to run AI on device. This needs better batteries.

1dobwi4,2024-06-25 17:40:56,INTC and AMD,"**Thesis: AMD ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) are Undervalued Stocks**

In the dynamic and highly competitive semiconductor industry, AMD ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) have demonstrated remarkable resilience, innovation, and market presence. Despite their solid fundamentals, both companies appear undervalued when considering their current market prices relative to their intrinsic value, future growth potential, and industry positioning. This thesis will explore the reasons behind this undervaluation, focusing on financial performance, strategic initiatives, market trends, and competitive advantages.

### Financial Performance and Valuation Metrics

1. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratios:**
   - Both AMD and Intel have P/E ratios that are below the industry average, suggesting that the market has not fully recognized their earnings potential. AMD's forward P/E ratio is around 25, while Intel's is approximately 12, compared to the semiconductor industry average of 30-35.

2. **Revenue and Earnings Growth:**
   - AMD has exhibited robust revenue growth, driven by its strong product portfolio and increasing market share in both consumer and data center segments. The company's revenue grew by over 20% year-over-year in the last few quarters. Intel, despite facing competitive pressures, has maintained stable revenue streams, with significant contributions from its data center and Internet of Things (IoT) segments.

3. **Cash Flow and Profitability:**
   - Both companies generate substantial cash flows, supporting their ability to invest in R&D and return value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. AMD's free cash flow margin stands at around 10%, while Intel's is approximately 20%.

### Strategic Initiatives and Technological Advancements

1. **Product Innovation:**
   - AMD's Ryzen and EPYC processors have gained significant traction, challenging Intel's dominance in the CPU market. The company's advancements in 7nm and 5nm process technologies have positioned it as a formidable competitor in both consumer and enterprise markets.
   - Intel has made strides in expanding its product lineup, with significant investments in AI, machine learning, and autonomous driving technologies. The introduction of its Alder Lake processors and advancements in 10nm and future 7nm nodes signal a robust product roadmap.

2. **Strategic Acquisitions:**
   - AMD's acquisition of Xilinx is expected to enhance its capabilities in adaptive computing and bolster its presence in key growth markets such as 5G, automotive, and aerospace.
   - Intel's acquisition of Mobileye and investments in autonomous vehicle technology underscore its commitment to diversifying its revenue streams and capitalizing on emerging tech trends.

### Market Trends and Competitive Landscape

1. **Demand for Semiconductors:**
   - The global semiconductor market is projected to grow significantly, driven by increasing demand for high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and IoT applications. Both AMD and Intel are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends.

2. **Competitive Positioning:**
   - AMD's competitive pricing and performance advantages have enabled it to gain market share from Intel, particularly in the desktop and server CPU markets. Intel's extensive ecosystem and strong brand equity continue to make it a preferred choice for many enterprise customers.

### Underappreciated Catalysts

1. **Supply Chain Resilience:**
   - Both companies have demonstrated resilience in navigating the global semiconductor supply chain challenges. AMD's partnerships with TSMC and Intel's plans to build new fabs in the US and Europe are strategic moves to mitigate supply risks and ensure capacity for future growth.

2. **Expansion into New Markets:**
   - AMD's foray into gaming consoles with partnerships with Sony and Microsoft, as well as Intel's advancements in the data center, networking, and edge computing, present substantial growth opportunities that are not fully reflected in their current valuations.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, AMD and Intel are undervalued stocks, with market prices that do not fully reflect their intrinsic value, robust financial performance, strategic initiatives, and potential for growth in the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry. Investors should consider the compelling investment case for both companies, driven by their innovation, competitive positioning, and resilience in the face of industry challenges. As the global demand for semiconductors continues to rise, AMD and Intel are well-equipped to deliver sustained value, making them attractive opportunities for long-term investment.",70,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dobwi4/intc_and_amd/,wallstreetbets

1doaz0o,2024-06-25 17:01:26,Last call for IMAX -- Time to get your popcorn out!,"IMAX is headed for $23.  And if you already missed the 30% run up in CNK the last 3 weeks, fear not, there is still hope.  The summer box office has finally started heating up and I strongly believe IMAX is the next theater stock to benefit from the summer hype cycle.  Inside Out 2 is knocking it out of the park — having already amassed over $750M in less than 2 weeks.  Clearly good movies will put butts in seats – especially when record heat waves are giving people another reason to find indoor options for entertainment this summer, 

So why IMAX you ask?  Because AMC is a disaster financially and you probably already missed the big run up in CNK, Yet IMAX is still trading well below its 52-week highs with a price target of $23 – a 35% increase from its current price.  IMAX also has the best patented tech in the industry with a global brand that continues to grow market share in every corner of the world.  IMAX is the Apple of the movie industry.

So why now?  Because movie theater stocks almost always perform well during the summer blockbuster season.  Especially when they start the summer a discounted stock values and particularly when when the biggest action films of the year are just around the corner -- and that's proving itself out once again this year.  And now we are just days away from A Quiet Place Day One opening this weekend – followed by Despicable Me4, Twisters2, and capping the summer blockbuster slate with Deadpool/Wolverine which is expected to delivery a $200M opening weekend.     

If any of these titles hit paydirt – IMAX will be well rewarded between now and Labor Day.  Get your popcorn out.  Good luck and Happy Trading. ",0,0.43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1doaz0o/last_call_for_imax_time_to_get_your_popcorn_out/,wallstreetbets

1doapt1,2024-06-25 16:50:48,McDonald's $MCD,"# McDonald's: A Top Dividend Growth Play

*  McDonald's has achieved 13 straight quarters of revenue growth, despite high inflation hurting consumer spending.
* The fast-food chain plans aggressive expansion, with a goal of reaching 50,000 global restaurant units by FY 2027.
* McDonald's is a 'Dividend Aristocrat' with consistent profitability and potential for dividend growth.

  
The company continues to see consistent, low-single digit growth in revenues and is aggressively expanding both domestically and internationally. With moderating inflation and a strong unit growth plan for FY 2024 and beyond, McDonald’s has significant potential for top-line expansion. Additionally, shares trade below the 1-year average price-to-earnings ratio, suggesting a favorable risk profile for long-term investors.

McDonald’s, a multinational fast-food giant with over 40,000 locations in more than 100 countries and a market cap of $185B, has shown 5% year-over-year revenue growth, achieving $6.2B in the first fiscal quarter. Despite decelerated revenue growth due to inflation, the company still saw a 2% increase in comparable sales in Q1'24, driven by menu price increases, marketing, and customer traffic. The reintroduction of the $5 meal aims to boost foot traffic in U.S. restaurants.

https://preview.redd.it/x6g8gh3ryq8d1.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4ec84173238b75ded8f3c82ea9371f6cd26429

As inflation moderates, increased purchasing power could accelerate McDonald's comparable sales growth. A reversal of the recent downward trend in comparable sales could significantly enhance the investment appeal of McDonald's shares and potentially drive a revaluation of its share price.

The biggest risk for McDonald's is the trajectory of inflation. Persistent inflation in the second half of the year could continue to pressure consumers. To attract more customers, McDonald’s, in cooperation with its franchisees, has reintroduced its $5 value meal. However, a resurgence of inflation in the third and fourth quarters could pose a significant risk to the company's comparable revenue growth.

We all know gays love to roleplay and pretend, so lots of potential in this Gay-AI. Even if their AI-wingman feature is just some horny twink bot, it's a revenue stream waiting to happen...

Another thing is that they're only monetizing 7% of their users right now. SEVEN PERCENT. That's like leaving money on the table. They recently tried changing their pricing model to offer weekly subs and bam... 16% increase in revenue per paying user. Just like that. 💅 The CFO also said earlier this month that AB testing revealed prices are more inelastic than expected in the US, so they can clearly still increase revenue by optimizing their pricing.

Now I'm not saying GRND is gonna Uranus 🍑 overnight. But consider this: Match Group is trading at 5x Grindr, but Grindr's extending far beyond dating, their users are spending 2x the time on the app, gays are statistically richer and hornier, and tap water is turning everyone gay these days.

1do75ai,2024-06-25 14:19:28,$ZI Buyout or News Catalyst Incoming? Unusual Activity.,"Very unusual options activity for August, Stanley Druckenmiller and a few other top fund managers heavily increasing their positions. Company is FCF positive, currently running a share buyback, smells like a buyout.

Firstly, $ZI attracted a little retail attention when Stanley Druckenmiller bought in (If you don't know who he is look him up).  After substantially decreasing his position in $NVDA his largest % increase was in $ZI. Bare in mind he was one of the first into NVDA and to actively inform the public why he thought it was such a good bet.

His most recent 13f shows that he increased his position by 500% and has an average share price of $17. Earnings were then released and the stock tanked, pretty common in current conditions for a software name.

He wasn’t alone in his aggressive purchase, infact, the below super investors also increased their positions:

**David Shaw**  by 266%

**Israel Englander** by 129%

**Joel Greenblatt** by 407%

 All of which have solid track records, feel free to investigate them yourself.

 **But this is when it gets very interesting…**

On the 15^(th) May the open interest across most strikes was low, almost no activity, especially the August strikes. Yet that all changed at a very rapid pace.

 15^(th) May the open interest for the $15 August strike was just a single contract.

 16^(th) May this jumped up too 19,315 in practically a single block

Fast forward to the 11^(th) July and it jumps up to 39,380

 That’s just for the $15 strike..

 The $16 strike had 171 open interest on Monday last week, today it's 20,700 and again looks to be  a single buyer. With just a few small orders copying the buy.

Now $14 is getting scooped in large quantities and the $13.

Leaving the following for 53 days out:

13 strike - 10,221 OI (1,000% increase in 10 days)

14 strike - 15,362 (500% increase in 10 days)

15 strike - From 1 to 41,033 in 30 days

19 strike - From 0 to 37,136 in 30 days

The rest of the chains have very

To me this indicates that somebody is obviously aware of a catalyst that's due to happen before that date, otherwise you’re likely to go further out (longer dates) or closer to in the money when putting on such size. My best bet would be a buyout target of $18-$19 based on the strikes chosen. Like I say, this is a calculated guess. Had this play been made for much further out contracts I’d be less suspicious. However, buying 70,000+ contracts for <60 days out clustered around the same strike is a huge green flag.

Now they're hitting the shorter dated too, July's, check todays flow so far. It's getting completely absurd at this point and to me it looks like block orders (a small group of buyers).

https://preview.redd.it/ijoj92d08q8d1.png?width=1087&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2087ca6f142390108e75a8480f701a204a68e80

  


As the saying goes, somebody always knows.

What gives me more confidence is the company continues to outperform, has a healthy balance sheet and produces more and more free cash flow each year.

**Free Cash Flow:**

2023 $408

2022 $388m

2021 $275m

2020 $152m

2019 $30m

Cash on hand: $400m 

Current Share Buyback plan still operating.

The company is founder-led by Henry Schuck, rather than me regurgitate a load of information you can view the companies latest results here.

[https://ir.zoominfo.com/static-files/d7e521f0-7040-460b-bfd6-3d1940ac7a5d](https://ir.zoominfo.com/static-files/d7e521f0-7040-460b-bfd6-3d1940ac7a5d)

32.57% of the float is held by insiders with very tiny activity this year. If they were concerned about the companies share price being a real reflection of the business, I’d expect to see some of that enormous interest exiting. Given the latest numbers, I’m not surprised they remain bullish.

So what I’ll be doing is simple, positioning with some short dated calls accompanied by shares. I've gone for shorter dated because I'll buy again in 30 days If the buyout doesn’t happen.

Notes: I may be completely fucking wrong about everything above.

I promise I'm not here to just serve you purple and orange kool-aid like some fucking 7 year old on the street corner of a walmart parking lot. Here's a list of the negatives and positives

1. FedEx has reduced costs by eliminating daily overtime and double time

2. Weekly guaranteed minimum pay for non-driving positions has been eliminated

3. The 5B share buyback plan is only halfway completed. This meaning that FedEx still has $2.5B to buy back

4. FedEx is implementing a new wave of AI cameras in the contractor trucks. Everyone knows that AI is bullish.

5. FedEx has closed many stations over the last year, with many more likely to come. These closures included layoffs. Both of these are bullish

The negatives

1. The loss of the USPS contract will decrease yearly revenue by $2B. However the contract was not that profitable and FedEx will be able to reduce expenditures on the extra mail flights that will be eliminated

This has me wondering… is it time for me to ape my entire margin account into Tesla?

In addition to Tesla, the Boeing hate has been rampant. Do you guys realize that at any one moment, thousands of Boeing aircraft are flying in the air? Flying a Boeing across the globe is safer than driving to your local Wendy’s. Yes, the company has glaring issues and I am not discounting the several hundred people who died due to the company’s negligence. But are we forgetting that Boeing operates in a duopoly with $500B in backlog? Do you really think this company is so regarded they won’t be able to turn it around? At one point, Boeing had a stellar safety record and was the crown jewel for America. I believe now that they’re getting anally pummeled by everyone and their mom, they will fix things.

People citing GM and Citi Bank as behemoths that failed are absolute morons. Y’all realize that Boeing sales aren’t falling the way they did with GM, right?

1dntryk,2024-06-25 01:10:01,Money rotation by the funds,"After briefly becoming #1 by market cap, Nvidia has shed the tag and has dropped by few percentage points every session since 20th June. 

Rationale:

1) Bearish engulfing pattern: but bearish engulfing pattern has occured few times [latest being on 10th March, 2024] and the stock has rebounded strongly to scale new ATH
2) PE stretch in AI/Tech : PE multiples of Nvidia and related tech co [Broadcom, SMCI, Micron etc] have expanded sharply and there are concerns if revenue and profits can keep pace. But this may be revealed in next earnings cycle only.
3) General exhaustion with tech/AI: investors are taking profit and looking to invest in different opportunities. The fact that DOW rose and S&P remained steady [since 20th June] means the money still remains in the market.
4) Pull backs are healthy: it allows market/investors to reassess  the stock. Short term traders exit while provides attractive entry points for long term investors.

*I had pointed in one of my previous posts to shed concentration in AI/tech and to seek different opportunities.

Funds have been reported to rotate money out of tech/AI into energy, [surprisingly] bank, and other defensive stocks.

Crypto, cryto ETF, and crypto related stocks have tumbled because of  no rate cut expectations for Q3, '24.

I believe Gold may stay range bound or face a mild correction in weeks to come.

Meme stocks seem to have lost steam as investors attention shift to other opportunities.

What to do? 

Nvidia [now at pre split level price] and others now are attractively priced compared to previous week. This correction presents an attractive opportunity for long term investors.

Keep AI/Tech concentration < 50%

Seek different opportunities and even defensive stocks [Berkshire, Walmart, Mondelez, General Mills, Chubb, 3M etc]

1dnpym8,2024-06-24 22:11:26,NVDA YOLO Update - Still an Easy Hold - Do you Regards Ever Zoom Out?,"So I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dl1jco/nvda_easy_hold_yolo_update_140k/) post after last week's dip about holding NVDA leaps after \~30k intra-day drop on Thursday from $172k to $140k.

I knew the gheys would be out and about in full force especially after today.  Sure enough, I get out of work and see there already are some unhinged DMs/comments waiting, or asking for an update.

I sold none of them, and in fact added a couple more Nov '24 leaps during lunch today.

I've already made \~10 posts at this point over various NVDA news/announcements in the past quarter, along with DD posts on the progression of this YOLO that started from \~$38k, went to as high as $172k and is now down to $105k.

I'm not repeating all that again, or listing more objective reasons simply because there's been no fundamental reason driving this sell-off other than:

a) profit-taking

b) quarterly-end rebalancing

c) sell the news factor after NVDA briefly toppled MSFT

All I'm gonna say is - Blackwell revenues for this year are going to be nuts, and it'll become clear in the next earnings call. If there ever was a time to load up on the dip (and I mean either leaps, or shares -- not regarded weeklies), it'd be now.

1dnncz2,2024-06-24 20:21:54,NVDA has room to drop further,"NVDA goes on amazing runs, but it also has had its fair share of corrections. It’s such a hot stock that their corrections have usually a bit more volatility than a standard defined 10-20%. 

Below corrections I could note in between their epic run:

Nov ‘21: $32.98
Jan ‘22: $22.84
Correction: -30%

March ‘22: $27.69
May ‘22: $16.69
Correction: -39%

Aug ‘22: $18.71
Oct ‘22: $12.08
Correction: -35%

Edit: Aug ‘23: $49.36
Oct ‘23: $40.50
Correction: -18% 
thanks for checking user u/cchud

Mar ‘24: $96.77
Apr ‘24: $75.61
Correction: -21%

Jun ‘24: $140.76
Today: $118.11
Current correction: -16%

I could see NVDAs current correction still having 500 bps of downward movement. If the investor relation event wasn’t this week I’d be even more certain of it. 

Positions: I recently scalped $1000 off NVDA with 6/21 Puts, and sold 10 shares at $138. 

In short, I think NVDA corrections usually will be greater than 20%. Not financial advice - do what you will with this. Cheers

FedEx is facing challenges just like every quarter, weaker demand, etc, despite these hurdles, FedEx has been focusing on cost-cutting measures to improve its bottom-line performance.

What they have done to improve these challenges? 

Cost-Cutting Measures:

1. DRIVE Program: FedEx launched the DRIVE program, a comprehensive cost-cutting and efficiency-improving initiative. This program aims to streamline operations across its transportation segments, lower overhead costs, and enhance digital capabilities. These efforts are expected to result in significant long-term savings and improved profitability. 

2. Operational Efficiencies: FedEx has focused on improving operational efficiencies within its various units, particularly in FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. By optimizing routes, reducing unnecessary expenses, and leveraging technology, FedEx aims to enhance service levels while cutting costs.

Strategic Adjustments

1. Volume Management: Despite a weaker demand environment, FedEx has been actively managing its volume levels to match capacity more effectively. This includes adjusting flight schedules hedules and reducing underutilized assets to better align with current demand trends.

2. Rate Increases: To offset some of the financial pressures from declining volumes, FedEx has implemented rate increases for its services. This helps to maintain revenue levels even as shipment volumes fluctuate. 

FedEx and artificial intelligence… 

FedEx has indeed been integrating artificial intelligence (Al) into its operations to improve efficiency, enhance customer experiences, and streamline logistics processes. Here are some key areas where FedEx is utilizing Al:
Predictive Analytics and Automation

1. Routing and Logistics: FedEx uses Al to optimize routing and logistics. By analyzing large datasets, Al helps FedEx predict the most efficient delivery routes, reducing transit times and fuel consumption. This improves overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.

2. Package Sorting: Al and machine learning algorithms are employed in FedEx's sorting facilities to automate the process of package sorting. This enhances accuracy and speeds up the handling of parcels, particularly during peak seasons .

The debt that accumulates from these loans is referred to as “phantom debt,” because it’s unclear just how much is out there and how well consumers are paying them back. Juniper Research estimates these transactions could reach nearly $700 billion by 2028.”

My take: since there’s no visibility into BNPL, it will be abused by consumers and lenders all the way to fookin’ Valhalla. Also, seeing offers for installments on DoorDash. 💀

l6omry,2021-01-28 05:06:14,"An Open Letter to Melvin Capital, CNBC, Boomers, and WSB"," **Mods do not delete, this is important to me, please read**

&#x200B;

I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.

Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.

To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.

To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.

To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.

To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.

We just have to hold until they fold. Today's actions by several brokers just show how desperate the hedge funds are getting.

Hold with your immovable diamond hands for all that you hold dear and we will be breaking Wall Street **TOGETHER** while making gargantuan tendies in the end!

**WE LIKE THE STOCK.**

Comment with brokers that aren't corruptible and that we can move to fast!

**YOU CAN STILL BUY ON**  
**Fidelity** (10k instant deposit, accounts can be opened quickly)  
**Others:** Vanguard, Revolut, TastyWorks, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Webull, Degiro, Wells Fargo, M1, Public, etc.

*Edit*: It seems like TD Ameritrade, Webull, M1 Finance, and Public have removed their restrictions. Brokers are folding to the political support we are receiving.

We've got so many comments and submissions that we can't possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators. We wrote software to do most of the moderation for us but that software isn't allowed to read the Reddit new feed fast enough and submit responses, and the admins haven't given us special access despite asking for it.

We're suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad. That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don't get to hang out with your friends anymore. Discord did us dirty and **I am not impressed with them destroying our community** instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts. That is pretty unethical.

To add to this, people are co-opting our name on twitter. I won't mention their accounts, but lots of handles with ""wsb"" and ""wallstreetbets"" in them are pretending to speak for us. They're saying things that we don't agree with, driving traffic to derivative communities and shitty pixelated merch stores, and generally making it harder for us to define who we are. There's also too much political bullshit in a community that was never *ever* political. The only way I want to occupy Wall St is in a suit myself or rent-free in the mind of a blown up short.

~~That is why I'm throwing my support behind the Twitter handle in general. We need a way to PUBLICLY reach out to the staff of the infrastructure that is failing us so the world can see that we aren't doing anything wrong here if they don't respond. We need to be able to respond directly to a reporter that is lying to the world about our clubhouse. We can't be expected to meet any expectations when we aren't given the tools we need.~~

~~That's not to say I approve of every message or will even be in the loop for all of them, but it's clear to me we can't do nothing and we need a megaphone.~~

~~We'll do our best not to pretend to speak for you, but to try to speak with the volume our name now seems to command to get shit done for us.~~

lajk83,2021-02-02 01:05:33,Today wasn’t a bloodbath for $GME or $AMC. WE watched LITERAL insanity as Hedgies sat and traded their trash BACK and forth to each other in order to cause YOU to panic. HOLD. BUY.,"DD I saw posted elsewhere: hedge funds are trying their hardest to short ladder $AMC and $GME. Just hold your stock, buy more if you can afford to! 

Check out real time trade stats by googling: ""Nasdaq AMC real time trades"" and you'll see all the trade orders are 100 share volumes every millisecond. 

These are desperate hedge funds trading their stocks back and forth for a lower and lower price, driving the price down. The price drop means absolutely nothing AS LONG AS EVERYONE IS HOLDING, this will explode!

The shirts tried their damndest to drive down the share prices of both $GME and $AMC today. Specifically look at $AMC. With all that volume traded you’d expect a shitload more movement. What they got was **resistance** You could see them continuing the ladder attack after hours when YOU can’t trade. On BOTH stocks. 

The way forward is to tell them to go fuck themselves and BUY that shit up tomorrow. Let them keep punting the football back and forth to one another all day. If they can double down and play the long game SO can we. 

This is not financial advice. I’m just a retard who REALLY likes these stocks.

lalucf,2021-02-02 03:03:05,I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions,"TLDR; **Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit. They've been illegally ""closing out"" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.**

So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.

I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.

What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.

Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf

In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:

""Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.""

It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.

I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.

I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.

Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner

EDIT: Ok, so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up:

* The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively. So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million. What I'm doing is summing all the *debits* to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range. This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts

* I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock. However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor. Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about ~10M. We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME.

* My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect, I got mixed around when I wrote this initially. The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was ~80%. The 120 figure for S3 was correct. 

* Please checkout the linked DD - it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can. 

* Share this post and the related DD. We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word. 

* I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow. Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening.


If I take an L to 0, I take an L to 0. I don't invest what I can't lose. But you can bet your ass I'll be holding till this blows open.

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926–2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt’s 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers’ Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged—March 27—silver fell to $10.80, the metal’s biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, “A billion dollars isn’t what it used to be,” the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978–91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",86022,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1o04/there_is_no_silver_short_squeeze_happening_none/,wallstreetbets

laikd0,2021-02-02 00:17:47,I feel like clarification is needed about Today,"There’s a lot of new people on here that don’t really understand the play going on right now on both sides and I felt like we need to clear up some misconceptions so you can make your own decisions. 

**Why no spike today?**:

First of all, we can’t know on what day the Squeeze happens / they cover their shorts. 
All we know is it has to happen sooner or later since the hedgefunds are losing millions if not billions EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON’T COVER. 
They use several tactics to delay it, but they can’t circumvent it.
They’re bleeding, and all the retail investors holding are slowly sucking the blood out of their fat ugly bodies.

It might take just a few days, or weeks...
But eventually, when they cover, WE retail investors get to set the price.
That’s why you keep seeing 10k (or 69420$) is not a meme. Because it’s not.

We also know they’re down BAD. Why?
Because they’re attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.

So let’s see what tactics they are using:

**Short ladder attacks**:

What is a short ladder attack? 
The big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it ""looks"" like the stock is plummeting. It’s only effective if we would sell. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ay2s/short_ladder_attack_explained/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Just look at the volume. People are not selling:
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont_panic_and_just_look_at_the_fucking_volume/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

**Infiltrating WSB and other social media**:

Here are some random screenshots I took of WSB Synth. Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There’s tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again. All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started, just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell:
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahqex/notice_the_two_obvious_melvin_employees_time_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

**Manipulating the Media**: 

Here are some News channels caught lying / manipulating the market: (SEC if you read this...)
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8n7o/fake_news/
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6e16/cnn_back_off_this_is_a_lie_literally_a_5_second/

Now let’s get some clarification on **SILVER:**

There is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver. People don’t seem to realize 3 things:

1. **Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.** GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO) 
2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make. 
3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that’s why they’re pushing this narrative in the media. 

SLV inverting GME: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.

**IF** you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that’s just my retard opinion. 

**SILVER ISN’T “REDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY“.** You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.

Silver squeeze not happening links:

Well. Let’s see to what extend they fucked up exactly: 

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails–to–deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

Long version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

**At these levels it’s NOT about the price, it’s about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession. That’s why they want you to sell so bad.**

🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎

Last but not least I’m holding because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I’m holding because I hope to see a better future and I’m holding for all you out there. 
To the Moon or zero.

I was reading 2 articles in Wall Street journal and it made my blood boil- first article was saying “random penny stock went up 30% with no news or announcement”- the people that are paid to predict and report and are the expert at stock market are saying this shit. The second article right after made me want to fuck the writers wife: “GME and AMC, Reddit favorite stocks, plunged after apparent loss in interest from retail investors” LOSS IN  INTEREST? MOTHERFUCKER WE CAN ONLY BUY 5 FUCKING SHARES EACH. 

WE LIKE THE STOCK. THOSE FUCKS JUST DON’T LET US BUY IT. How is GameStop and AMC and BB not already suing robinhood? Is any stock expert really gonna act like had they not restricted in Thursday, it would have went down that much? 

What the fuck is this gaslighting? That last week didn’t happen? Why are every news channel acting like they called GME or BB or AMC falling like it happened organically and not deliberately by everyone involved? 

Is GME worth 400$? FUCK NO. But since when was the stock market about actual worth? Stocks have become fiat currency in themself, doesn’t matter than company quarterly earnings, or its news, if people buy it, it goes up. When you restrict that- it goes down. 

We were up against billions of fund, trading platforms that we do not own or have a say in, our weapons, controlled by the enemy. Those fucks in TV acting like they actually called GME falling like this or acting like this is perfectly normal are trying to gaslight us about what happened in Thursday. 

FUCK THEM. We still got GME to go up and caused international fevor- we made the right call, we had the right stock, we had the right people, our enemies just had control of the only weapon we could use.",77284,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8lwf/why_the_fuck_are_we_acting_like_we_lost_we_made/,wallstreetbets

l78fuh,2021-01-28 20:52:00,"I just bought $5,000 in $GME. I would not have done this if the brokerages didn't try to manipulate the market.","I've been following /r/wallstreetbets for years. Usually just for a laugh as I am a stodgy buy and hold guy and don't speculate often. When I saw the $GME shit happening a week ago I thought it was pure stupidity and was not planning on investing. In fact, I bought some $GME puts (which I've since sold since somehow they've gone up based on volatility) betting against the crowd here.

However, what has started as a decentralized short squeeze has morphed into a class movement. I'm a big populist and think we need big changes in this country, especially a transfer of wealth and power from the elites to the people. When this morphed into a class movement I became obsessed. However, I still wasn't going to buy in because I shy away from speculating on ultra risky stuff like this. But when Robinhood and all the other major brokerages colluded to cause a massive sell off, that's when it became a matter of principle. I've watched all day as the stock has remained relatively stable on very little volume. People are holding despite wall street twisting your arm and trying to make you tap out by only allowing you to sell. It's a beautiful thing to see.

l82y7u,2021-01-29 20:17:25,How to Buy GME Above Broker Limits,"How to Buy GME etc [Loophole]

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that ~~will work.~~

**Update Feb 1 [Loophole Closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/la6sll/rh_blocks_exercising_of_gme_call_options/?utm_source=adioking&utm_medium=your_mom&utm_name=golden_fuckboy) **

1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today).
2) Scroll all the way down the call list.
3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark).
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!

P.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~

_Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.

_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._

EDIT:

1) This works for pretty much any stock.

2) There’s a catch. You need enough money (please don’t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.

Example:

- $GME is $300
- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000
- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).
- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)

After exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.",75147,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82y7u/how_to_buy_gme_above_broker_limits/,wallstreetbets

This would be roughly equivalent to the $700 billion bank bailout in 08 that was necessary to prevent ‘systemic risk’.","The short positions put on by the hedge funds are posing a systemic risk to the market.  Bail out both sides by liquidating the hedge funds, but not the brokers or clearinghouses, but also put a buy order in for $10k per share to allow GME shareholders to exit.  Isn’t $700 billion better than a financial meltdown?  Just like last time you can ‘put rules in place to make sure this won’t happen again’

In 2008 the banks held risky assets and got bailed out because they said the innocent normal people would be hurt even more if you didn’t bail them out, so the government did it.

We posed a risk to the liquidity of the hedge funds, brokers, and clearinghouses yesterday.  By bankrupting them it would probably cause a temporary stock market crash as they liquidate their positions.

Are we not now in the same position as the banks were in 2008?  Buy us out of our positions for $700 billion to save the rest of the market and the normal people right?

Edit because it got attention:  if this ever was a reality it would in the form of a loan to clearinghouses and brokers to cover any losses up to $10k per share.  They would have to pay it back over time.  The government would get the money back and reimburse taxpayers, while at the same time collecting taxes from the gains of the retail investors. Long term the clearinghouses and brokers recover, the market continues to function,  and then they never let hedge funds put on a risky play like that ever again. The hedge funds involved are deservedly bankrupt, and the retail traders get the reward they deserve by playing the free market game by the rules.",74740,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7sx9e/its_time_for_a_government_bailout_of_gme/,wallstreetbets

There are quite a few wsb-logo Twitter accounts pushing this. This is BS & the straight up the ANTITHESIS of who we are. 

By buying silver/going long on silver, you would be directly putting money into the pockets of the EXACT HEDGE FUNDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF $GME 🚀 🚀 🚀 💎 🙌  The hedge funds are LONG silver NOT short silver.

The media, Wall Street, normies, and every other non-WSB autist are trying to push you to buy silver. This would be a tragic, irreversible decision that not only will most likely not make you any money because the squeeze is fake, it will put you on the sidelines from this righteous and glorious war we are in. 

If you are looking for alternative investments to GME, I’d recommend simply getting in on the $BANG GANG- Blackberry, AMC, Nokia, and GME. 

For the feds and the media and all the dumb people reading this, I am the last thing from a financial advisor and am a complete, 100%, full retard autist. 

BANG GANG CHEEEEEEEHOOOOOOOOO

Edit: I am not talking down on silver as an investment, I am not saying it's not a good hedge, I'm not saying anything bad about silver in any form. I'm simply pointing out that right now, this ""squeeze"" that all these people are referring to is definitely not a ""squeeze"" at all and is an artificial hedge-fund driven attempt to reduce the GME momentum and we should all be cognizant of the media manipulation and happening everywhere including right here. For all you that want to buy silver, great, buying the bullion directly in my humble autistic opinion is better than shares in a fund that supposedly buys it but don't trust some autist on the internet. BANG GANG

Edit #2: Fellow autists, we have ascended to the #2 post on all of reddit. Our $GME gains this week and beyond will carry us to the gates of Valhalla.

I can see comments of single mother putting her life savings in and college kids borrowing money at a very high interest and going all in.

This is not a joke. Losing money is not a joke. If you get a loan and buy a stock, you are at a risk. Only buy with money that you can afford to lose. Don't put your life savings or retirement corpus on this. 
For people who are getting emotional and going all in against the hedge funds, the hedge funds will have a small scratch and you would be destroyed in the end. The concept of YOLO with buying stocks works only till you don't go bankrupt.

I know this sub is now filled with a lot of new people telling you to buy the dip. Don't get emotional with money. This sub is for people who like to invest money that they can afford to lose, and not your life's savings when you are a single mother.

I know Ill get downvoted to oblivion saying a statement like this, when the whole sub would be filled with ""to the moon 🚀""
But please don't put in money you can't afford. Don't get loans and buy stocks. Money ain't coming easy and all the money you lost is earned by the hedge funds you wanted to destory in the first place.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: 

__We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.__ Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1.	⁠Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.
2.	⁠Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.
3.	⁠Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.
4.	⁠Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.
5.	⁠At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.
6.	⁠Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.
7.	⁠The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  

__I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user ([u/zshub](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/gl5vgof/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)) who said a market sell order executed at $2600 for him.  Also, someone else for over [$5,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7em07/coworker_had_a_limit_executed_of_a_little_over/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) per share. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?__ It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

[Listen to this ](https://youtu.be/7RH4XKP55fM)to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

__TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.__

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",68600,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/,wallstreetbets

Edit 02/04 #2: [We did it Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcvluc/an_update_on_the_wsb_coup_d%C3%A9tat/)! 


tl;dr on tl;dr: Founder bad, greedy, got banned for being greedy. Being greedy again with new spotlight on the sub. 

tl;dr, in 2020 the original founder (after being gone for years and did nothing to contribute to the sub), along with a couple of mods, attempted to monetize the sub for personal gains. Users and other mods fought back. Hundreds of users got mass banned for speaking out, mods who spoke out got removed as mods. With some help from users, mods found precedent of another sub creator getting banned for trying to monetize a sub and sent plea to Reddit admins. Reddit admins banned offenders and gave sub back to the good mods. 

u/SpeaksInBooleans (RIP) investigated the circumstance of the events and made video exposing the offenders:

[Mega thread after the victory](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx5zwf/ladies_and_gentlemen_we_got_him/) for reference. 

It's important to know/remember this now, because the same person that got exiled for being a tyrant is doing a media circus, trying to ride the current spotlight for personal gain, again. Hey CNN and WSJ, stop interviewing that dipshit. The sub has always been about its people, and what you guys wanted to do (as retarded as you are). No single person speaks for the sub and controls its destiny. It is in good hands with u/zjz aka u/SwineFluPandemic

Edit: He is spreading complete lies about the sub and the mods that got him removed:

>	Despite being its founder, Rogozinski was kicked out of the forum in April for trying to eliminate the hate speech plaguing the community.

>“There were a handful of mods who were straight up white supremacists,” he said.

>“I have really thick skin and people can say whatever they want to me, but at some point there’s a moral standpoint — like with my kids, I don’t want them to think, ‘Well, they can say whatever they want about you,’” he told the paper.",67273,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7b1b7/a_dark_part_wallstreetbets_history_and_why_its/,wallstreetbets

False media reports about “Reddit traders” moving en-mass into silver, SPACs, or whatever is benefiting hedge funds at the moment is getting out of control.

My email to him. 
Hi Gary I have read many articles similar to Yours in the past day that reddit users are behind this silver push. I'm sorry to say this is not the case. I understand you implied that according to CNBC reports it isn't understood whether it is longtime reddit users or perhaps larger organisations at play here. I don't consider myself a long time user but I joined the community at a mere 1.8m members. That number in the few months I have been a wallstreetbets member has ballooned to 8milion+. I would urge you to check out the site and see for yourself the overwhelming sentiment that silver is simply a distraction. We love GME stock, we are not bored of it and the due diligence shows evidence that an extraordinary short interest DOES still exist for it. It would be wonderful to see a detailed article on this and I'm CERTAIN this would attract a lot more attention and clicks than another WSB LOVES SLV article. I'm not trying to demean your work in any way. 
Hope you have nice day, all the best. 
Yours, Jordan. 

P.S I really appreciate that your email address is on your article because even if I don't get a reply it makes you seem very easy to contact... A feature not shared with a lot of journalists. So thank you!

Let's send journalists some love and welcome them because we need all the help we can get against MSM

Edit - I've had quite a lot of messages concerning WSB's interest in silver dating back from long ago, long before I was a member so I just wanted to clarify something. 
Here is a clarification : 
I wanted to reflect the disparity between how few silver posts I was seeing on wsb in and around the time of the media hype and how so many media outlets were pushing the "" WSB's next target is silver!"" agenda. Of course this community is so big that there must be lots of diversity and it was a little ham-fisted to suggest nobody on the sub is buying silver. The important point in my mind was that MSM as I saw it had blanket reported something about the subreddit I believed was an inaccurate representation of the real sentiment.",58614,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbm1ks/i_emailed_a_journalist_to_let_him_know_that_wsb/,wallstreetbets

l97ykd,2021-01-31 08:10:30,The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situation,"I have been following GME since mid-September and over that time I have banked myself a %1300 return in the process. However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. ""The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!"", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**

Here is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

For you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper [""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, ""strategic fails–to–deliver."" Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.

This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more.

Moreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets\~\~. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME.\~\~ **Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**

GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's fails–to–deliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \~$125B market cap) had 13,960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 295 shares fail to be delivered.

How many shares of GME failed to deliver? **1,787,191.** As the white papers points out, the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock:

[Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \(x-axis\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \(y-axis\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/g723jvyhine61.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bad6c47b428d364de36e9888de35b79572d1da)

I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. **No real shares can be found** **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.**

*TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*

EDIT 0: Looks like I truly belong on this sub. On the first version of this post I didn't read the file description properly and summed a cumulative distribution. My numbers were wrong, but I have updated the plot and post with the correct numbers.

EDIT 1: You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers, not the entire NYSE. I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though.

EDIT 2: Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares: [report](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf). Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME.

EDIT 3: A lot of people were hung up on the ""3 shares per wsb subscriber thing"". I know many accounts are bots, I was intentionally underestimating that number. I have adjusted to 10 shares per ""legit subscriber"" to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns.

EDIT 4: What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say ""Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**"" We're not going to go back to mud huts, people.** This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems, possibly bankrupting some of them. Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary. Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again.

EDIT 6: I am getting thousands of messages. I won't be able to respond to all of them. Here is an FAQ:

1. *How do I learn investing?*I am not an authority on this, but my personal opinion is to first learn how to read a company's financial documents and value businesses and only then start thinking about putting your money into specific stocks. Read ""the intelligent investor"" by Benjamin Graham for this. Then learn how to think about picking stocks. I like Peter Lynch's books for this.
2. *What is going to happen this week?*I have no idea and I wouldn't dare to guess.
3. *Are you going to be killed?*I don't know where people are getting this idea. I have no special knowledge or insider contacts, and I am in no way, shape, or form an expert on the market or the system behind it. Please treat my tinfoil-hat conspiracy theories as just that. There is nothing to gain from harming me and I have no doubts about my safety. These are just personal opinions and I don't have any schemes to ""take down the shorts"" or anything like that.

[I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)  
  
  
[How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above.

laferl,2021-02-01 21:58:21,15 U.S.C.A. § 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight),"Dear SEC and President Biden,

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States. 

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member  of a national securities exchange -- **(2)**  To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, *a series of transactions* in any security registered on a national securities  exchange, any security not so registered, or *in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement* with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such  security, or **raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""**

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here

check this out

Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.

Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in  violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, **shall** be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price  which was affected by such act or transaction.""  


I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.

Sincerely,

Your Average Retail Investor

Well, I finally built a tool to do the same tracking and analysis for the US House of Representatives.   
[housestockwatcher.com](https://housestockwatcher.com)

The reason this took so long is that the House exclusively files their disclosures in PDF that vary wildly in quality and format, so for this project I have been transcribing every transaction disclosed. I am nearly done with 2021. I am sure 2020 will uncover lots of interesting trades.

I thought his message was so powerful that I asked him for permission to translate, post (can share chat with Mod if required or check directly with him) and fuck his wife (ok didn’t ask for permission) after and he agreed to ~~all~~ most of this wholeheartedly – like a true Autist. I am trying to catch the message – so don’t expect a word by word translation as you can never catch the greatness of the text in it’s entirety and I got to translate it in a way that even a US degenerate can follow it.

As usual no financial advice, I more or less just copied the text because I liked the text and I like the share. In general I have likely lost more than I won and the stock market is a mystery in itself to me. So make your own due dilligence and don’t trust financial advice of others (the argument for that you can read to a certain extent below).

**Autists, Degenerates, Idiocracy of the World – let me get this straight!**

In the coming days I don’t wanna see all this whining and bitching on this sub and espescially in the daily GME threads anymore. On every fucking corner of this sub I smell doubt, you read messages the likes of „this is over“, „we missed the squeeze“, „I am going to loose it all“, „entered at 320$ - I am doomed“. What the fuck is wrong with you retards, did you fucking wanker your wifes boyfriend dick all night and lost your mind over the effort to do so? I think I got to get this accross the Buddy Stephens way to get you down to fucking earth and get your attitude right.

**1) You come to a sub called** r/wallstreetbets **and yolo your hard earned money in $GME**

You realize what you are doing here - you true fuck - dont you? This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET – yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet-B-E-T-S!!! – and follow DD posted by people with names like „SHOW\_ME\_YOUR\_ANAL\_TITS“? You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry „One-Wish-comes-true“ show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn’t exist in this world? This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading (and we even don’t trade stocks normally!). This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado-masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in. Yes we have some (maybe a lot) DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long-term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments – this is about „get rich or die trying!“. This is not r/investing!

**2) Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up, hihihi**

If this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train? (and even you might get this image from all this „Saudi Arabia calling, China calling, Africa calling posts – but please they invest into BABA, Aramco or I don’t know what’s the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now – could be though the next big thing – got to see if I can find a DD on this). So why is this not happening? Because it is a fucking BET – the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r/investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red, while we always go for the magical zero. It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls (or boys) on the beach! The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand! And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize – you are potentially fucking with the system itself (by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn’t do if you like the system).

**3) Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen? 😓**

So there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME. It’s a fucking global movement now (or not – could be also the same 50.000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place) and according to the DD we just need to have 🙌💎and the shorts a bleeding their panties, their balls feel squozen (and not in a good way) and they are completely in defensive mode. What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi-billion $$$ HF are going to do? How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation? Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church (no offense if so)? What is wrong with you? Seriously! Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy – we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven’t understand the concept or how this works – speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up – desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors – shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious – you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let’s be fucking honest – most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody – I even don’t remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).

**4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**

Deal with it – we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That’s it. If we are right – this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock – do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought – hmmmm makes sense – I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don’t want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) – no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the 🚀 is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.

So please – no post without 🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🚀🚀🚀 and if you want to fukn leave the party – leave – but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon. This is the way and I fkn love GME and if this means I need to hold onto this beauty for another 25 years I am going to do it.

P.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I’d rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  – I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have 🙌💎

Edit 4: Heading for dinner. Crazy times. Will check later and decide whether to buy more tickets or not. But maybe good advice for some others to make a break. Chillax :)

Conversely, when the Oreo team reduces the amount of icing in their treats, markets tend to have great bull runs until once again society demands to push the boundaries of how much stuffing is possible.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Oreo_varieties https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stock_market_crashes_and_bear_markets

1974: Double Stuf Oreo released. Dow Jones crashes 45%. FTSE drops 73%.

1987: Big Stuf Oreo released. Black Monday, a 20% single-day crash and a following bear market.

1991: Mini Oreo introduced. Smaller icing ratios coincide with the 1991 Japanese asset price bubble, confirming the correlation works both ways and a reduction of Oreo icing may be a potential solution to preventing a future crash.

2011: Triple Double Oreo introduced. S&P drops 21% in a 5-month bear market

2015: Oreo Thins introduced. A complete lack of icing causes an unprecedented bull run in the S&P for years

l8lxuy,2021-01-30 13:42:15,"If your friends and family are wondering why you're buying $GME @ $300, maybe you can explain it to them like this:","There's a rich kid in town. Let's call him Melvin. He thinks he's really smart. He finds a coupon for $20 off the new Nintendo Switch during the holidays with no limit on number of units. This is easy. I'll go ahead and sell the Switch now for $200 and then buy it for $180 with the coupon. Easiest $20 I'll ever make. He goes and tells all his parents' friends at the Citadel Country Club that he can get them the new Nintendo Switch for their kids. He collects $200 each from 150 parents. He now has $30K and will use that money to purchase Nintendo Switches for $27K. He'll have earned $3K in just a few hours. His parents will be so proud.

There's another kid watching Melvin this entire time. Let's call him Keith. Keith doesn't like Melvin. Keith is good friends with the guys over at Gamestop. He finds out that there are were only 100 new Switches shipped to the entire country. Keith and his 99 friends buy all 100 Nintendo Switches on the spot.

Later in the day, Melvin goes to Gamestop with his $20 off coupon and says, ""I'll take 150 Nintendo Switches please."" Gamestop guy looks at him and says, ""Sorry, we're all sold out."" Melvin goes to the next Gamestop. Same story. All sold out. He goes to all the Gamestops in the city and can't find a single Switch. He won't be able to fulfill the orders.

Meanwhile, Keith is telling all his friends about what Melvin promised the members at the Country Club. Nobody sell him the Nintendo Switch that you bought, no matter how much he offers you. Nobody likes Melvin, so everybody holds on to their Nintendo Switch.

Melvin is in trouble. His parents rich friends are all asking when they are getting their Nintendo Switch. Melvins parents are angry, but they don't want to lose their standing in the Citadel Country Club. They have to help Melvin gets 150 Nintendo Switches. Now remember there are only 100 Switches in the city, but Melvin has created the expectation among the parents that there are 150. This is how you get a short percentage over 100%. Melvin has promised more than actually exist.

The price of Nintendo Switches in the city skyrockets. Melvins parents were able to get a few units from Keiths friends, but they had to pay really inflated prices for them, first $1,000, then $2,000, now $3,000. It's nearing Christmas, and every rich parent at the Country Club is desperate for the Nintendo Switch they promised their kids. They can't trust that Melvin will be able to get them one. They all start bidding against each other for Switches. Everybody in town is in on the action now. Everybody wants to get a Nintendo Switch to sell at the country club for $10,000. Meanwhile, Keith and his friends are just hanging out and playing Animal Crossing.

\[Edit 1: Thanks for all the love and awards. I'm really grateful. I'll try to answer as many question as I can on the thread and in the DM's\]

\[Edit 2: A few astute monkeys have pointed out some flaws in my story. The example above is an oversimplification and I left a few important elements. So here's an expanded version and I've had to adjust some of the numbers above to make room for new wrinkles.

In a more accurate version, Melvin went to his brother Steve's high school and borrowed 150 Nintendo Switches from the high schoolers. He tells them all that if he doesn't give them back within 24 hours, he will give them each $5 per day. The high schoolers know that it's not likely that Melvin will give it back in 24 hours, so they will be perfectly happy to collect $5 per day. He sells the 150 Switches to the Country Club parents for $200 each, but now he owes 150 Switches to the high schoolers. This is a naked short. He sold Switches that were borrowed but didn't own. Let's assume the Country Club parents wrapped the Switches and they are now under the tree and out of circulation. Although there are 250 Switches in the city, there are now only 100 Switches in circulation (Keith's friends). So you have a situation where Melvin owes 150 Switches to high schoolers and there are only 100 available (150% short position of float). Melvin is overconfident and thinks he will get 150 Switches same day or at the very worse case, the day after, and maybe have to pay 150 Switches x $5 penalty = $450. He'll still have made $3,000-$450 = $2,550. The $5 penalty due to the high schoolers is interest or Melvin's carrying costs, so the longer Melvin cannot get the Switches, the more expensive it's going to be for him. After 4 days, he's at break even and will lose $450 for each day he cannot get a Switch. It gets very expensive for Melvin and his parents very quickly. This is what's happening for the past week or so for GME. The hedge funds are bleeding money every day they cannot fulfill the IOU.

For those who are asking why Melvin doesn't just pay off the high schoolers with money, let's say that the new Zelda game is coming out and they all want to play. They also know that the price of Switches is rising. Even if Melvin offered $800 or $1,000 to cancel the IOU, they know that they can no longer get a Switch on the open market. In addition, the high schoolers are probably aware of the rising trend in Switch prices. They may think that it's better to wait for a Switch that will be worth $15,000 in a few days than to get paid off by Steve now for $1,000. So while it's possible that Melvin could buy his way out of it, it's very difficult.\]",53076,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8lxuy/if_your_friends_and_family_are_wondering_why/,wallstreetbets

Over the past few days, this subreddit has seen an absolutely insane amount of growth. In the past week, subscribers have quadrupled, pageviews have surpassed 1 BILLION, and the potential financial gains are unlimited!

We wanted to take a moment and teach all the newcomers what wallstreetbets is all about.

Wallstreetbets is a place of high risk, high reward, trades. Some are well thought out... but not usually.

#**We've got [losses](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair%3ALoss&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=top&t=all)!**

There was the guy who [bought gourd futures and lost everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzoh1c/i_am_financially_ruined_agricultural_futures/), the guy who [turned a $5,000 investment into a $58,000 loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aeqcvt/i_dont_know_when_to_stop/), the guy who [put everything on the Argentinian peso, hours before it collapsed](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpcao5/the_guy_that_called_argentina_to_tank_was_right/eworkdq/), the guy who [had to take physical delivery of oil](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5e3e5/i_bought_oil_at_32_yesterday_and_made_26000_sort/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=wallstreetbets&utm_content=t1_glamjdk) and [""GUH"" which is a video you just need to watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/). You can check out some more of [those losses here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair%3ALoss&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=top&t=all).

#**We've got [gains](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair%3AGain&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=top&t=all)!**

Like resident GameStop multimillionaires u/deepfuckingvalue, we had the guy [who accidentally made $110K](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7w6cq0/i_somehow_made_110k_this_morning_and_im_still_not?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=wallstreetbets&utm_content=t1_glamo3x), there's the guy who [shorted the powerball lottery](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3zvxp5/shorting_powerball_update/) You can check out some more of [those gains here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair%3AGain&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=top&t=all).

#**We've got general craziness!**

Like when [we found the ""infinite money cheat code"" on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drt5tr/guh_of_fame_2019/), forcing [Robinhood to post to WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4r0sy/robinhood_statement_on_options_collateral_and/) and push an update disabling options, we had [the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, Martin Shkreli](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3q38qg/iama_martin_shkreli_ceo_of_turing_pharmaceuticals/), regularly posting, livestreaming, and even becoming a moderator. We've got [Mr. Beast investing $100,000 in whatever the top comment said to invest in](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hrorfa/i_will_invest_100000_into_whatever_is_the_top/). We've got [Pokimane, asking what to invest in and becoming a moderator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f75eod/thank_you_for_giving_me_moderator/) and subsequently crashing the market in March. We have people who lost bets and had to [drink their pee](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gak2gf/i_said_if_spy_closed_green_today_i_would_drink_my/) and [tattoo our logo on their butt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/io8i5z/im_back_bitches/) (NSFW).

So if you have an insane trade idea, **post it here**! We look forward to roasting you like we did u/deepfuckingvalue when he posted about GameStop in 2019. He's worth 8 (9?) figures now, so who knows, maybe you'll be next?

What you won't find here are political discussions, self-promotion, and other nastiness is not related to our single and most important goal: making money. 

For those new to the subreddit, you'll notice that we use [some ""colorful"" language](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7fr21/basic_guide_to_wallstreetbets_culture_for). Rest assured, we mean you no harm. It might take a while to get used to how we talk, but you'll quickly find that this subreddit is surprisingly kind.

#**And we've got you!**

The community here is incredible. Each and every one of you make this place great and better than it was the day before. 

For those who have been around for a while, please reach out and help the newcomers. For those who are new, please don't hesitate to ask questions and get involved. 

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for being here.

fxw3uz,2020-04-09 17:00:59,Why should any American company ever act responsibly again?,"Whats the point of good corporate governance and fiscal responsibility? The companies that leveraged themselves to the moon, did stock buybacks to hyper-inflate their stock price, live on constant debt instead of good balance sheets are now being bailed out by unlimited QE. Free money to cover your mistakes. Why would anyone run a good business ever again? Just cheat and scheme and get bailed out later.

Edit: I am truly honored to be the number 1 post on WSB. To get validation from you autists and retards, the greatest American generation, is the peak moment of my life. Thank you all.

Edit 2: Many of you are saying this post is socialist. It is anti-capitalist. It is anti-wall street. It is none of that. My post is in fact about fixing capitalism so it is done the right way. Don't reward companies that are managed poorly and don't invest their profits wisely. Capitalism is about survival of the fittest and rewarding the winners not the schemers and cheaters. I'd rather have a profitable company that pays its workers livable wages, doesn't use sweat shop labor, doesn't pollute our environment, gives good quality healthcare, paid family leave, sick leave, maternity/paternity leave, reinvests in improving infrastructure, keeps low debt to equity, and has a 12 month emergency fund for a black swan event. Not companies that give all the money to the CEO and Board and nothing to the workers, do stock buy-backs with profits instead of improving infrastructure or saving for emergency funds. Let the greedy poorly run companies fail so we can invest only in good quality companies that treat their workers well. We will all make tons of profits in the market with well run companies and main street America will also be able to live a decent quality life. 

Edit 3: I am not a salty bear. In fact I want the market to do well. But this is not the way. Bailing out weak companies that didn't save for a black swan event because of CEO greed is just making this bubble bigger and bigger and it will only pop worse later on. JPow will ruin our market and the economy with this fake bubble with his printer. Let the market be free so we can shed weak companies and true capitalism can see a rise of the strong companies and the market can moon again.

JPow and his printer are really helping the Wall street elite. Jpow doesn't care about you. Now the tax payers are bailing out shadow banking. Junk bonds are risky loans that private equity, hedge funds, and other shadow banking institutions give out to desperate companies that can't get loans from regular banks anymore. That's why junk bonds are shadow banking instead of traditional banking. JPow is using his unlimited printer to BAILOUT and give free money to the shadiest and greediest characters of wall street and society in general - private equity, hedge fund managers, shady billionaires.

PE, hedgies, shady billionaires were screwed because the economy just halted and companies were going to default on these risky loans since they had no revenue coming in. This is who JPow is helping. He just bailed them all out by buying these risky junk bonds on the back of the American tax payer. You may become homeless and starve, but private equity, hedge fund managers, and shady billionaires will be made whole by the fed.",50009,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxw3uz/why_should_any_american_company_ever_act/,wallstreetbets

ll68pc,2021-02-16 15:32:02,"The SEC Just posted the new numbers for Failure to Deliver. Guess What, GME is failing to deliver every day.","Hey 'Tards,

The  New Failure to deliver data is JUST OUT from the SEC.  Here is a simple pivot table.   It's still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  I'm sure people will analyze this better than me.   But I wanted to get this out to everyone ASAP.

Edit: Failure to deliver is how many shares were not accounted for at the end of the day.  GME has been failing to deliver in some capacity for weeks now.  This data is posted by the SEC Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA).  It is only posted every two weeks, for the previous two weeks.  But this is the most recent data that everyone has been waiting on.

From the SEC regarding this data

>""The   figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that  includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.    In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific    point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's    aggregate fails.""

&#x200B;

SEC FOIA Site: [https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)

Data File: [https://www.sec.gov/files/data/fails-deliver-data/cnsfails202101b.zip](https://www.sec.gov/files/data/fails-deliver-data/cnsfails202101b.zip)

&#x200B;

GME had 2 million shares failed to deliver one day totaling 300 million $

EDIT: Because so many people are bringing up XRT.  Which contains a lot of GME. Here is XRT.  Hmmm.  Notice anything interesting about Jan29th between these two??

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There is also AMC... AMC is still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  This continues the trend for both of these stocks not being delivered every day.  AMC had 27 million... yes million shares failed to deliver.

&#x200B;

I'd like to ask everyone to do what they can.  I am not recommending buying any of these stocks.  But there is for sure, something still going on.  We need to try and get this data daily.  Contact your reps, etc.

&#x200B;

There are links to information about Failed to deliver.[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm)

Is GME considered a Threshold Security? ✅

>In   order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the   restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified   fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.    Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold   securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for   a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ✅

>As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (""participant"")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically,  the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position  by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

&#x200B;

Edit:  I wrote a quick post about this last report.  I'll copy some stuff here.  AS requested, here are some data snippets for ""normal"" stocks.  note the number of failed to deliver is way lower.

Just remember that when DFV was buying $GME at prices as low as $4 per share he wasn't signing up for the 'diamond hands never sell' club and he never got into the play for reasons like smashing hedge funds, curing cancer etc. That stuff has all come about from us and people jumping on the bandwagon.

WSB before this crazy week that has changed the sub forever was all about taking on risk to try and make money fast. DFV has achieved that on a scale we haven't seen before and if he decides to take profits we should support him doing so and not get upset that it may affect the price etc or say he betrayed a cause he never signed up for.

My positions are 80k in PLTR options mostly expiring next year/2023 and 40k PLTR stock.

Edit: Obviously none of this was financial advice anyway but seriously NONE of this is financial advice I'm just a retard on the internet and if you listen to me for it maybe you're also retarded

WE ARE ACTUALLY FUCKING CRUSHING IT.

It’s genuinely incredible. And it deserves to be said. It is *astounding* the uniform resolve people are showing right now.

The price action today is complete bullshit, short ladder attacks mostly. And we are getting to the end of their bag of tricks. 

I’m not even worried anymore, and I almost never trust crowds. But when you look at the volume you see that we are overwhelmingly DIAMOND HANDED MOTHERFUCKERS.

Y’all have amazed and inspired me. I am going to sleep well. 

And when the hedge funds inevitably break because they basically have to, I am excited to have a beer on Mars with some of y’all.

Cheers to becoming astronauts together. 🚀 🚀 🚀

rjjecq,2021-12-18 23:27:36,We should buy Reddit.,"Not the stock. The **actual company.**

If we all get together and own 51% then we will own this entire website.

We could make the rules, profit from the advertising, and finally get paid for the memes we make.

I've even come up with a list of things we could do as new owners:

1. Reddit mods can apply for paid-internships at Reddit. This is much closer to having a real job than what they currently do and would benefit the organization.
2. Your flair is your official title at the company. IE: instead of ""CFO"" you'll be ""PotatoFart""
3. NSFW posts will receive special protections--and if you happen to work in our new skyscraper then NSFW posts are automatically considered SFW.
4. Everyone gets a turn in the corporate jet.
5. Elon becomes a mod. He can also apply to become a paid intern.
6. We have a monthly party on our company yacht: *The S.S. VisualMod*.
7. Our corporate cafeteria is a dining hall with fast food restaurants along the side--but they're all Wendy's.

I think this is a great idea.

Keep it high and tight.

👖🚀👖🚀👖🚀

Edit: Well, if you guys are going to spend money on awards for this dumb post IDK how we're going to buy enough Reddit shares to own the company. Mission aborted. 

Also, it seems that roughly 23% of Redditors don't like a fun joke--so we wouldn't want to share equity with you losers anyway.",45142,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rjjecq/we_should_buy_reddit/,wallstreetbets

Deepfuckingvalue, who was unfortunately outed, is increasingly looking like that person. 

He is now in more danger than any of us. I doubt that anything will acruallly come of this, but now real heat is coming out, as tends to when traditional power dynamics are upset. 

Not to mention; despite the fact that he was acting as a private individual and not actually acting in an official or financial position, the optics are being set up against him. 

Do not attack him if he decides to withdraw all today. He has his own life and family to protect. He’s also much more vulnerable than anyone here, and he doesn’t have the polemical connections like citadel does. Not to mention he just screams boomer bait. 

I suspect he’s feeling pressured into not selling because of the cult status he has here. But his own personal life comes first. Chances are, he may never be able to work in an official financial position again. 

I’m not crying for his financial future or anything, he’s worth 8 figures. But again, he needs that money given his position. For the rest of his life he will be a political prop. Please respect his decisions and most importantly realize he’s a fucking human being with his own life

lai796,2021-02-02 00:00:52,Please stop promoting Belfort,"I get it, a famous person doing memes in our favor is fun. We all love the wolf of Wall Street movie. But let’s be real here. 

Belfort is the epitome of what we’re up against as retail. He’s a convicted con artist who actually did so much fucked up shit he didn’t just get a slap on wrist from the SEC, he actually went to prison. 

He was just anti-GME a few days ago, and now he’s meme-ing in its favor? A meme repeating the sentiments being echoed in this sub? 

It’s pretty clear to me. Belfort came to the realization that this is the next generation of decentralized hedge fund. There’s power when a bunch of apes all like the same stonk. He sees the popularity and realizes the potential and impact that crowd sourced DD will do. He knows communities like this will grow. And he wants to use you. 

this is nothing more than seedy opportunist bullshit because Belfort realizes you’re the exact type of person who makes him rich- a retard who yolos into risky investments at the idea of massive % gains. he wants to capitalize on the popularity of GME and this sub. He wants to sell you his shitty motivational book and the idea that he can teach you how you can be rich and famous with his “miNdSeT” when really he got rich by scamming people, and famous for being caught. 

Please. Stop. He is not your friend. I wouldn’t be surprised to see him try to leverage popularity gained here to a “trading community” of his own: 

> “Belfort will share his favourite market sector in “Wolf Report” and give 10 lessons in “Wolf Mentality”, which includes tips on “what it takes to be a trader, how to handle emotions, the intangibles of success, how to take advantage of opportunities, and how to learn from your mistakes”.”

I don’t know who you are or where you live or what your living situation is like or why the fuck we haven’t sold for massive tendies yet, but I do know that this isn’t about money anymore. It’s about proving a point. 

Call it an opportunity, call it revenge, or justice, I know we are on the right side of this. I’m proud to be holding next to you fellow brothers and sisters in arms. I will not sell. I will hold until Melvin and Citron and any other fucker who think that they can get away from the inevitable by using dirty tactics and mis-information to de platform us fails at their own game.

But they fucked up. The mods here got shit cleaned up and fixed in a fuckin amazing amount of time because they’re apart of this too, this community of fucking freedom fighters, stone cold killers, average fucking joes who are staring these hedge fund “eXpErTs” in the face and saying “Stonks only go up” and won’t sell until they bleed them dry.

Hedge funds get paid more by fraudulently creating more shares when the stock goes under. They cannot cover anywhere near this price level because the shares don't exist. Manipulating the number of shares also dilutes the reported short float. Retail is holding on to shares they need and just not letting go, as some of those shares retail has are fraudulent.

lkzviy,2021-02-16 08:54:09,I am going to short the whole country of South Africa.,"I assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts South Africa is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.

Under the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.

That is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American.

Edit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock.

I first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA ([EZA](https://www.bing.com/search?q=eza+stock&cvid=0d411debffed4d50b06fa54733b0bb0a&FORM=ANAB01&PC=DCTS)) wasn't an accurate representation of SA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of SA (mostly to other parts of Africa). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.

My new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the [South African Rand's inflation](https://www.inflationtool.com/south-african-rand) was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting US Dollar inflation to stay between 1-2% a year while the Rand (ticker ZAR) stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for SA to implode.",41948,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkzviy/i_am_going_to_short_the_whole_country_of_south/,wallstreetbets

My father was 57 years old, and had a lot of issues. Nobody really thinks about all the good things until someone is gone. My father wasn't a man of means, but during the early stages of my childhood fought hard to provide us an amazing life. And did so without ever really letting us know. 

After a divorce from my cheating bitch of a mother, after multiple back issues, multiple surgeries, and multiple risks to his day to day life, I think he just went downhill. 

I haven't gotten an official answer from the coroner since he's over 3 states away and it's all being communicated mostly through texts with his girlfriend right now, but honestly I'm not sure I want to. 

I came here to say, my father believed in me with all of his being. When I told him I owned 4 shares of  GameStop and that it was way over priced when I bought it, he just told me how proud he was. Pretty convinced he didn't even know what I was saying. But in that same way he believed in me, he believed in every single one of you too. My father would've loved this cause and would've rallied with us till the end.

I had a cool ass dad and you guys all deserve to have a cool ass dad too. He believed in me, and he believed in you too. Whether you're winners, or losers, or damn dirty apes. 

We love you dad. Thank you for believing in us.

Edit: 
1.)Thank you to everyone who has left me their condolences. Believe it or not, I attribute a lot of my ability to move past some of this because of your support. I don't have a great relationship with a lot of other members of my family, and my girlfriend has been great at supporting me through this as well. 

2.) Thank you for all the upvotes, even if you didn't leave a comment. I don't really care about the karma (as I pointed out to a few rude people here), but seeing that so many of you got to read the thread and appreciated my dad the way I did REALLY means a lot. Thank you for that. Also want to point out that I have been taking all of the coins I got from the awards (That I ALSO didn't really care to receive but they manifested nonetheless) and giving out awards to members of this subreddit for all of their devotion to the cause.

3.) I didn't realize I would be the one executing my dad's estate however after I wrote this post I started becoming inundated with calls and text messages from funeral homes, coroners office, investigators, and family members. To anyone who has not gone through this process before I would advise you to have the hard conversation with your parents and ask them what their final wishes are. While my father ( dubbed ""poppawallstreetbets"" by another user here) didn't really have much in that department I believe we have put together an arrangement he would be happy with. We will be having him cremated(which at least that part WAS vocalized), flying out to his home town in Carpenteria, California, and having his Ashes spread along the pacific ocean where he spent his younger years surfing before injuring himself. I have done my best to invite as many of his friends and family as I can. But for anyone in the immediate area, I invite you to attend as we finalize more of the details over the next 2-3 months.

ldjbg1,2021-02-05 22:39:28,"Analysis on Why Hedge Funds Didn't Reposition Last Thursday, Why They Didn't Cover on Friday, and Why They Want You to Think They Did. (GME)","Fellow Apes, I have seen a lot of discussion on the possibility of hedge funds covering and whether or not they could have covered during the RH shutdown. I have done some analysis and would like to shares my results. This is not investment advice and should not be construed as such.

I know you guys can't read, but I highly recommend learning how to read and reading this.🚀🚀🚀

**Part 1: What Happened on the 28th?**

As we all know, last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze. This is a significant day because it broke momentum, and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions.

[Here is a graph of the 28th with some of my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/XyG9sfV)

[Here is a tweet from Ihor (S3) stating the short interest data as of the 28th](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20)

Per S3, Short Interest was 62.9M as of the 27th and 57.8M as of the 28th. The net SI is (57.8M)-(62.9M)= -5.08M. This means the net short position reduced by 5.08M shares, however, many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down.

Well lets say that's what happened, and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly. We will also assume this happened in a vacuum, i.e. retail did not contribute to any volume, so that we can get a liberal estimate.

To establish a short position at a higher price, hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $482.85. If the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling, than they would have opened 15.8M more short positions. ~10M in volume happened in the first 10 minutes, so at best they would have 10M more shares sold short between $275 and $350, and the remaining 5.8M positions would be opened between $350 and $480.

This means that if shorts added to their position at this time, the best they could have done is add ~15.8M short positions at an average ~$300. This is assuming **no covering** was done during this period of time, which is highly unlikely considering the price **went up.**

Now, during the freefall following RH trade restrictions, there was only 10.4M in volume. If hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price, they would have only been able to cover 10.4M positions, and 5.7M of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300, only 4.7M could have been between $300 and $112. This is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time, and it doesn't even account for that fact that **covering would drive the price up, not down.**

Lastly, after the nosedive there was a bounce of ~9.2M in volume. If we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average, they would only be able to add 9.2M at an average of ~$250. Once again, however, adding positions would have drove the price down, not up.

So even in the most ideal situation using RH's restrictions and ignoring market mechanics, shorts would have only been able to add 25M ideal short positions at an average of ~$280, while covering only 10.4M at exorbitant costs.

This likely didn't happen, for several reasons. 

First, S3 reports that short interest decreased by 5M on the 28th. Now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading, however, they would be at non-ideal prices.

Second, this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass, the price would increase not decrease, and when shorts sell en mass, the price would decrease not increase. 

Third, this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother, also highly unlikely given the hype at the time. 

Fourth, in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share, and we know that, at that time, GME was **hard to borrow.** 

What is more likely is the **inverse** of the above, which would mean shorts covered 15.8M shares at an average cost of $300, then short sold 10.4M shares at an average of $250, before further covering 9.2M at an average of $250. **Despite ideal circumstances, that is not an ideal result for hedge funds.**

That means hedge funds **are not** kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points, that would be impossible.

**Part 2: What About Last Friday?**

Now this was an important day, GME fought hard and closed at above $320. What makes this day confusing, however, are the claims that short interest drastically decreased.

[Here is a chart of the 29th with my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/nU0JOXs)

[Here is a tweet from S3 claiming short positions decreased by 30M shares by the end of Friday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356018482471718916?s=20)

Now I won't get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question, you can look into those on your own. What I want to go over is **how could it be remotely possible?**

S3 claims 31M shares were covered on the 29th, however the share price had a net decreasing trend. There were only 2 notable upward rallys, and combined they only account for 24M shares. If hedge funds covered the whole 24M in volume it would still be 6M shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves. Where did the other 6M shares go? I find it hard to believe they could cover 6M shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday.

[Also note that Short Volume was 17.6M on Friday](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

So on Friday there was 50M in volume. 17.6M of that volume was due to shares sold short, so SI would be (57.8 SI as of the 28th)+(17.6M shares sold short) = 75.4M. In order for short interest to have decreased to around 27M as [S3 said](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752?s=20), it would have required the covering of (75.4M)-(27M) = 48.4M shares. **How do you cover 48.4M shares when there is only 50M volume and 17.6M of that volume was used to ADD SHORT POSITIONS?**

**There simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31M shares. At most, 32.4M shares TOTAL could have been covered if EVERY single purchase of GME was by a hedge fund with a short position, which would make SI (75.4M)-(32.4M) = 43M. It is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor, insider or institution purchased GME shares on Friday, so the actual SI is likely much higher.**

Furthermore I want to draw attention to **other times shares were covered** and their effect on the price, and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31M NET shares last Friday.

[S3 claims](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20) that from Jan 12th to Jan 14th, the SI went from ~69M to ~62M, a decrease of 7M shares. On the 12th GME was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43, an &gt;100% increase.

They then claim that from the 14th to the 25th, there was a slight steady increase in SI as the share price crawled towards $50. From the 25th to the 27th there was literally **exponential growth** in the share price **despite no change in SI**. But then, all of a sudden, on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5M short positions and a significant reduction in price, and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31M shares along with a steady decline in price. How could that be remotely accurate?

There was 50M in volume on the 29th, how could the purchase of &gt;31M shares by a single entity, not even accounting for retail, result in a net decrease in share price? 

**Part 3: How Could They Do It?**

[Read this post, and the sources within it, in detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5rd9/evidence_pointing_to_shorts_did_not_cover/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)

Shorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered **when they have not**

There were $43M worth of mid March 800c purchases, you do the math.

Why was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday? Why is the media still aggressively spreading FUD? Why are there bots everywhere in WSB? Shorts haven't covered, they can't cover and they wont. They also **did not** shift themselves into an advantageous short position last Thursday, there was only 19M in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances. They want you to think they covered, they also want you to think they have a better short position. 

They want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to. If there were they would have repositioned on Thursday. Brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldn't find the shares to cover, nor could they find enough shares to reposition. They really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail.

TLDR: Seriously, read this whole thing. I know you won't, but do it. Hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the RH fiasco last Thursday, it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts. They also did not cover 31M shares last Friday, it would have been impossible based on volume alone. They want you to think they did, they need you to, but they did not.

I want to alarm you retards and the mods this is how propaganda infiltration works. The first one comes out of the blue and everyone likes the post without considering the guys hidden agenda. Watch the coming weeks another user claming ""chinese citizenship"" giving his perspective because we liked it. This is CCP (Chinese Communist Party) shit to have more influence over investors (users here underestimate how much influence this subreddit has).

lco5he,2021-02-04 19:44:06,This is 100% Proof that GME is *literally* in Countdown-to-Launch Phase,"Ok, fellow mongoloids.  I truly believe I've figured this shit out. 

I've been neglecting sleep and insufflating copious amounts of Colombian blow just so I can remain symbiotically attached to every shred of current market data I could find about GME and its current trajectory. 

So, I'm basically an expert at this point (and so is my cousin who used to work for a NASA contractor in Cocoa Beach, Florida). 

This basically puts me on par with that Cramer guy or whatever. 

Anyway, here's a snapshot of where we stand today: 

&#x200B;

[A concerning uppy\/downy thing for some, but a harbinger of extreme, stratospheric ascension for the better-informed among us](https://preview.redd.it/vhlskfppfif61.jpg?width=966&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f7426badc70e80e2ef9e342b4a2bcd622b40b704)

&#x200B;

Now, I want to draw your attention to to the dimensions of a three-sided polygon (aka triangle) that I created by referencing a few points that seemed highly sus and therefore worth referencing.   


The result of my wizardry is thus:

&#x200B;

[I used black because it's the color of my soul when I think about how evil the HF guys are in comparison to the paragons of virtue here on WSB](https://preview.redd.it/3rragnyjgif61.jpg?width=966&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da2182d457dbe697f52406c689f7660c9a9a62fd)

Now, this is where shit gets interesting. 

I knew there was something uncanny about the shape of this triangle. I fucking knew that I'd seen this EXACT same triangle before in relation to advanced rocketry, but I wasn't sure where. 

So, I contacted my dealer, boofed another eight ball of the Devil's dandruff, and got to work meticulously pouring through all the available data until BAM. I found it. 

Feast your eyes on this: 

&#x200B;

[Just another fancy firework from our friends at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab? Not so fast. ](https://i.redd.it/6ss1u9u1jif61.gif)

Notice something peculiar? 

You don't? Of course you don't, because you haven't fucking studied this shit to death like I have. 

If we focus on JUST the first half second of this gif, we get this:

Then, when when zoom and enhance, we get this: 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

See where I'm going with this? 

If not, let me make shit CRYSTAL fucking clear so that you don't have to marshal all six of your brain cells to see what's going on here: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m5zmgco2kif61.jpg?width=1016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d676e2f976c639fe5c8afc958c64dbd6ff7a1f0

These three-sided polygons are the SAME. I mean, not ^(exactly) but fuck, it's goddamned close enough to call it. And I'm calling it. 

Motherfucker, if you're not 100% convinced that GME is LITERALLY about to go fucking vertical, then you simply aren't paying attention. It's not my fault if you can't understand basic math, geometry, and astrophysics. 

Ok. My work is done here. After we've all made our millions, I wouldn't mind being handsomely compensated for the selfless efforts I've expended just so you mouthbreathers can have some fun money to throw around at your retirement parties.

But this situation is the first time I've felt like I have any sort of purpose since my wife passed away earlier this month.

All i have is one share, but thank you for letting me feel invigorated.  I don't have my livelihood riding on this.  But for the first time in a long while, I feel a fire inside me.  Thank you for this.

She always used to tease me for my obsessions with meme stocks, but I know she'd have loved to hear me rant about this bullshit in endless anti-establishment screeds.  I won't get to hear her laugh at me for it, but the least we can do is burn Melvin and Citadel to ashes.

She was stubborn as hell, and I hope everyone else here will join me in stubbornly refusing to sell.

Please don't send me money, thankfully, medical bills are not an issue as she had excellent insurance until the end.   I will be ok financially, as well even if im still making adjustments.  If you wanted to fund shares for me, buy them for yourself, because we're all in this together.  I love this stock and i want everyone to have some! However, if you want to give, I've been directing people to give to the American Cancer Society.  If that's cool, awesome.

l93dum,2021-01-31 03:27:41,"Days ago, Robinhood had the potential to be a major brokerage and a top IPO. Now there's a significant chance they won't survive","Bringing **millions** of new agents into the market, disrupting the whole industry with commission-free trading, an intuitive UI that any ape like us can use, becoming the #1 downloaded app across most app stores...

Without Robinhood, this whole thing probably wouldn't have happened and WSB would likely be stuck at 100k subscribers like it was 3-4 years ago. Because lets face it, a hugee percent of WSB use(d) Robintard because we're too low-functioning to use brokerages that use >4 syllable phrases like ""money market fund"" or ""moving average""

Something like this happening right before going public was **GOLDEN** for them. All they had to do was not be a corrupt sellout bitch, keep their huge influx of new users happy, and they would've been set to come out of this a more respectable, even larger brokerage, as well as a high-value public company.

Instead they decided to expose the raw underbelly of their shitty business model and go exactly against their entire mission statement. Even if capital/margin requirements was the reason for the restrictions (it was definitely a factor but protip: it wasn't the full story), it doesn't change anything about the end result. Who the fuck wants to use a BROKErage who can't guarantee functionality during historical black swan events that usually result in the largest transfer of money? And then, **even if** they can't maintain capital requirements to execute trades, they could have handled it better. Just fucking pull the money from somewhere. Take out a huge loan from somebody ASAP. You can always get instant money if you don't give a fuck about interest rates, which they shouldn't because it's short-term and like I said, it would've been **HUGE** for the future of the company. Another one, they could have restricted both buying &amp;amp; selling of the trending tickers, or just go down altogether (RH users are very familiar with the app being down and losing full functionality, why is this time any different?). Yeah it would've sucked but at least it would've fucking stayed consistent with their mission statement of fair, democratic trading for all. I fuckin work at Wendy's and I can still imagine several better alternatives than the BS ""difficult solution"" they did.

And speaking of their mission statement, it's complete BS. It's just a sugarcoated way of saying ""lol we allow poor people to trade and have pretty colors"". They clearly don't give a shit about DeMoCrAtIzInG tRaDiNg FoR aLl. Because if they did, their business model wouldn't have been a Wall Street megacorp keeping the lights on by frontrunning user trade data.

And yeah another reason why ""volatiilty"" and ""trade volume"" excuses are BS is because they **increased** restrictions on Friday when both volume and volatility **decreased** lmfao. Screw this POS jokerage.

Edit: And the lawsuits up the ass. They just finished a $65m SEC settlement **LAST MONTH**, think their rainy day fund is big enough to handle something like this immediately after? Lmao gl


Edit: Tbh this fuckery was such a double win for Citadel because they get to force RH to manipulate the market while also signing their death note, which for Citadel means less retail investors....

Having been here since before GameStop in January ( not by much), all of a sudden this sub is all about teamwork and taking down the corporate elite and “please we need help for stock XYZ!!!” or “ignore ABC!! You fools!! It’s all about 123!!!” All from accounts that are made in the last three to four months.

For fucks sake, this is not a team effort. This is not a bunch of masked individuals here to help you get out of the hole you dug by betting your rent money or your fucking aunt may’s entire pocket book on stocks that rise and fall by the swing of your dick! We are all here to make money and I wish everyone could remember WSB in its prime where you only posted actual shitpost memes from gladiator or some high quality material once in awhile to break up the real and massive loss/gain/yolo porn. That made it a little better when sifting through the scum of posts with ass DD to find that diamond in the rough of someone who posted something NEW or actually added info instead of repeating the same echo chamber of a false hope that “___ is the next BIG SQUEEEEZE” 

How about you gamma squeeze these nuts, shut the fuck up, and read instead of posting more bullshit for the mods to wipe clean like a triple-ply once-over clandestine shit sweep. These mods are heroes for listening to this cringy begging ape shit for months now, so try to make their lives easier and learn something in the process. 

Today was a bloodbath for memes, so welcome to fucking Valhalla you shit for brains monkeys, the keys to get out are on the next play if you managed not to lose it all or have another aunt to short squeeze. 

End rant 

Sorry for probably breaking the rules mods, you guys rock.

EDIT: first off, thanks for the awards and support blah blah blah I knew you guys were still hanging around like me, wading through the seas of bullshit posts to find my own bullshit post! But I’ve let you down, I forgot the first rule I ever learned here, which I learned before GME, before the “thanks u/CumFlakess”, before the Purple Mattress King, or low battery, etc..

la6vcb,2021-02-01 16:16:30,"WALL STREET PLAN - Trying to psychologically scare you with MANIPULATED BIG DIPS and then a SMALL recovery. They want to MAKE YOU DOUBT, that the NEXT BIG DIP, you could’ve SOLD at Recovery. This has been going on since Thursday for GME & AMC","Everyone,

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. They’re running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They’re just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there’s a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that’s why they’re playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That’s why there are lawsuits. 

1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

4)HOLD AND BUY🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕

5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️

6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN

7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS. With the restriction, this strategy is not plausible

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock won’t be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

10) think positive of the BIG REWARD. You CANT lose more than your total investment but  GAINS ARE LIMITLESS and this is what’s SCARING wallstreet. (Example if you invested 10k, all you would lose would be 10k but could be walking away with 100k, 1 million , 10 million depending on the resilience of all of us to BUY AND HOLD🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕)

We understand why this might have made you suspicious, but we're excited to put those suspicions to rest today.

Reddit Admins care deeply about the stability and continuity of the community, and so do we. At the end of the day, WSB is not defined by who is at the top of the mod list, it's defined by the conversations we create.

Even in the absence of zjz, we saw awesome discussions happening. Tons of great DDs, insane YOLOs, and beautiful, beautiful, gain and loss porn.

Now, with zjz back, we can take things even further. We can relax posting restrictions on account age and karma, which we use as proxies for post quality, and instead focus on the content of what's being said.

The truth is, I am very, very, optimistic about the future of WSB over the next 3-5 years. We have the absolute best mod team the subreddit has had since inception. Everyone who is part of a team now is someone that has played a big role of either the subreddit, or discord, community for years.

We appreciate your patience with us and the admins. We were all blindsided as we were thrown into this shakeup. No doubt mistakes were made at the beginning, but we're getting better every day to bring you the WSB you probably don't deserve.

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails–to–deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

Turns out he needed knee surgery that costed $4,000.00. I broke down because I didn't have that much, didn't qualify for the payment plan, and it was either the surgery or wait till his other knee blew out then put him to sleep.

I put all the money I did have in GME around $97/ share & AMC at $4.84 Tuesday morning (a little less than $1k) with an exit plan to get out once I had enough for his surgery. This morning after market open I was able to sell enough to pay for his TPLO surgery! I am in tears and really grateful. Thank you everyone and good luck!

lemfzi,2021-02-07 13:28:53,------------- Dear Elon -------------,"GMEs gone down I'm wondering why

I got out of bed at all

The morning short ladder attacks cloud up my portfolio

And I can't see at all

Even if I could it would all be red

But your picture on my wall

It reminds me, that it's not so bad

It's not so bad at all

\-

Dear Elon, I wrote you but you still ain't buying calls

I left the DD, my eviction notice and a rocket at the bottom.  🚀

[u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) uploaded 2 GME videos back in Autumn you must not have got em

There probably was a problem with the algorithm or something

Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit the Hedge Funds back,

Just a smack, truly yours, your biggest fan

This is Stan

>!\-6 days pass: also credit to u/jo9793 and u/ItzLog!<

Dear mister “ I’m too good for calls or buy GME shares”, this will be the  last bullcase I ever send your ass, it’s been six days and still no  tweet, I don’t deserve it?

I know you got the last charts, the media published them perfect.

So this is my DD I'm sending you I hope you hear it I'm in a Tesla right now, dare me to drive?

You  know that song by Darude? Forgot it's name.

About that guy who could a  saved that other guy from drowning, but didn't, then Phil saw it all,  then at a a show he found him?

That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning in debt

Now it's too late, I'm down a thousand dollars now, I'm drowsy

And all I wanted was a lousy investment or a call

I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall

I love you Elon, we could have been on Mars together, think about it, you ruined it now.

I hope you get shorted and you dream about it, and when you dream I hope you get shorted more and you scream about it.

I hope the hedgefunds eats at you and you can’t breath without GME

""BUY SILVER, BUY SILVER""

SHUT UP CNBC I'm trying to Talk

Hey Elon that's the hedge fund managers making them talk

But we didn't fuck them up yet, see I ain't like you.

Cause if they buy more shorts they'll suffer more and then they'll go bankrupt too.

Well gotta go they are taking my laptop and my car now

Oh shit, I forgot how am I supposed to send this post ou-

\------------------

\---------

# EDIT: Elon's reponse:

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy

You said your wife's pregnant by her boyfriend now, how far along is she?

Look, I'm really flattered you would buy TSLA calls like that

And here's an autograph for your Mother

I wrote it on the Tesla cap

I'm sorry I didn't see you at the annual stockholder meeting, I must have missed you

Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you

But what's this shit you said about you sold your GME when it fell too?

I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?

You got some gambling issues Stan, I think you need some counseling

To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when your stocks get down some

And what's this shit about us being ""in this together""?

I'm a billionaire lol

I really think you and your wife need each other

Or maybe you just need to treat her boyfriend better

I hope you get to read this message, I just hope it reaches you in time

Before you sell again, I think that you'll be doin' just fine

If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan

Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do have diamond hands

I just don't want you to do some crazy shit

I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago so I bought GME in the dips

Some dude was high on PCP and drove his car to a Gamestop

And ""STONKS"" he screamed, for 24 hours outside the closed shop non-stop

And in the car they found a phone with 0 GME left, but I forgot who it belonged to

Come to think about, his name was, it was you

Damn! 🧻 **✋**

l7xj5z,2021-01-29 16:54:21,A Small Reminder of Some of the Risks Involved,"There is a prevailing mis-understanding among people fresh to the market that you can buy and sell as much as you want at the ""market price."" This is false. You are buying and selling from real people or algorithms that believe they can scalp your order. The idealized scenario is that GME rallies, Melvin covers, and everyone at reddit gets out at the top. This represents a misunderstanding of market mechanics. Melvin will cover before we truly know it, and the crash will happen as quick as the rally.

So with recent events, you must ask yourself:

# Who is Your Counterparty?

Nothing is a sure bet. How confident are you that your counterparty is who you think it is? Thousands of redditors & new traders beyond have been buying stocks fully confident that Melvin Capital hasn't  exited their trade. This is also supported by some analysis provided by two different firms, although their estimates differ some amount. Confounded in this is the interpretation of the data: Does this include market makers and dealers that are short stock but covered with calls or options deltas? Is their information fully accurate in an event the likes of which has never happened? It's tough to know for sure. 

# Know Everyone's Hand

Your guess on *how much they've covered* and *when they covered* has a massive effect on how you perceive the value of this trade. Buying if you think Melvin has $10b notional to cover is a much better bet than if they only have $2b to cover. You also have to consider how much notional the rest of the market has bought in anticipation of a squeeze. The difference between the two represents your effective edge.

Remember, we don't *actually* know Melvin's current position. We don't know what's going on behind closed doors. We only know the hand they're showing us via media. Has their clearing firm taken over? Has a much bigger collection of firms absorbed the position? Have they been buying since Monday? Have they covered and have new funds entered the space at a much better level? 

You are fighting Goliath at a poker table in the city of Gath. The pot is worth $25 billion dollars. Ken Griffin has *never* lost. Melvin's prime brokers Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche are not used to losing (well, Deutsche is). They will do whatever it takes to take the pot *from you* and leave you holding the bag. They will not blink twice because there is a *lot* of *fucking money* on the line.

# Know What Can Go Wrong

Nobody could have guessed everything that happened this week. Prepare yourself for the unexpected. Your brokerage will undoubtedly close out your position at the worst possible time. The stock could be halted for days. You could be assigned on ITM options. Your stock could get delisted. Your stock may get diluted.

# Only Spend What You're Willing to Lose

This one is self explanatory. Your investment could go to zero. Even if you think you make money on every trade, if your bet size is 100%, the long term value of your portfolio is **zero*****.***

# Don't Take Out Loans on Emotional Capital

If you are new, you really don't know the gut-wrenching, stomach-turning feeling of seeing the possibility of your net liquidity hitting zero or negative. It fucking sucks. You just know the highs. You're buying along the speculative frenzy and frantic rallies, wrapped in anti-billionaire & pro-underdog themes. It may even feel good to think that a guy who cut his teeth at a firm notorious for an insider trading scandal is getting his comeuppance. We love the feeling. **If you are fully invested financially & emotionally, you are completely overleveraged and will pay the price.** Make feeling good your goal, and set limits that you can stomach. 

There are several feel-good stories of people making life-changing money to pay off their student loans or their family members' surgeries. Please think twice about this, and only spend what you can afford to lose. If placing a bet makes the difference between your pet living or dying, you may have a gambling problem. These were success stories because they got in at a much better level and could have had a much sadder ending.

Secondly, don't take it personal. There are people on the other side of your trades, your brokerage support line, the subreddit, the media. They are all playing their own hand to the best of their knowledge. It's easy to blame a broker, yell at their support desk, hate-tweet at a company, or even rage-text that guy you know who develops APIs at ETrade. A lot of people across the industry are *rooting* for you. Fuck, even Ted Cruz and AOC are *rooting* for you, because this transcends politics. If you're mad at Melvin Capital or Ken Griffin or the guys who crashed the economy in 2008, keep it that way. They will try and misdirect your anger in every single direction: brokerages, the media, and reddit. If your enemies are a few guys at the top holding a $25b short position and moving levers, keep it that way. 

Thirdly, if you don't want to be a human being for the sake of the person on the other side, be a human being for your wallet's sake. You make better financial decisions in the absence of emotions.",35618,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7xj5z/a_small_reminder_of_some_of_the_risks_involved/,wallstreetbets

lbaktb,2021-02-03 00:07:53,SOBER REVIEW TIME - what are the actual data we can use to assess GME as of today?,"*Edit: There's a lot of great responses and info about my questions in the comments! Will try to incorporate that into the post as I go, or make a followup tomorrow!*  


  
First off, my position: 1900 shares of GME @ 30, plus 5 calls @ $250. Peak value was nearly 500k.

https://preview.redd.it/96g5d07z45f61.png?width=1007&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e983f8d1a6b56bcf4201d32a56b0c2535886d5b

*This is not financial advice, I'm not an expert, etc*

\*\*WHY SHOULD WE STILL HOLD?\*\* I know there's a lot of sentiment around solidarity, and sticking it to the man, and 'fuck it, I'm down so much anyway'. NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD REASONS TO HOLD. I'm here to talk about the actual reasons to hold.

Here's our biggest problem: **Misinformation**

There is a lot of information being spread around like manure. Mostly unread, mostly un-disseminated, basically just a whole bunch of positive sounding claims meant to serve as confirmation bias.

How do we ensure we're not just buying into bullshit? **By determining exactly what data we have available to make decisions as of right now**. That is what I intend to review (and hopefully gather from you apes) here today.

**A REVIEW OF THE FORCES ACTING ON GME**

1. **Fundamental Value:** This isn't relevant right now. GME is presently a $20/share company, even with Ryan Cohen shooting magic rainbows out of his ass it's not worth more than $60 until they actually start changing their business model. When that happens the value will go up, for now 30% above expected online revenue growth doesn't mean shit in the bigger picture.
2. **Momentum:** This is the biggest reason we hit $500/share, and the biggest reason we're still at $90, way above fundamental value. Here's something to consider: **Momentum, not the squeeze, is why the share price is where it is -** rather, the growing global awareness of the squeeze provided the evidence needed for everyone to rush to get onboard.  But, people are also idiots. Momentum can change directions quickly from an upward to downward pressure, and can be easily manipulated, as we've seen.
3. **THE SHORT SQUEEZE:** What actually causes the high short interest to result in raised share prices? Short sellers who are actually (not theoretically) pressured into closing their positions at an overall loss, and en masse. If most of the shorters can wait out or hedge against their losing positions, then there never has to be a mad rush to buy up shares at whatever price. *Do you actually think Melvin Capital was at any point margin called?*  If/when they exited, they did so in an orderly fashion that best served their interest, to the point that they were straight up given a multi-billion dollar bailout by their competitors! These people don't play by the same rules as you, you fucking braindead monkey.
4. **The Gamma Squeeze:** Last Friday, for the second Friday in a row, a vast majority of calls expired In The Money, and a bunch of call owners were owed shares by today (T+2 rule). The theory behind the gamma squeeze is that call sellers didn't have good risk models and didn't hedge their calls well enough, and so didn't actually  own enough underlying shares to hand over, and now need to rush to buy them at market price. Could that be why there was a massive spike from 80 to 150 this afternoon? Maybe. **But a gamma squeeze can also backfire**. All those people assigned shares may not have the tens of thousands in cash ready to buy, or the margin to borrow. That means all those shares get dumped back on the marketplace.
5. Straight up motherfuckin dirty illegal manipulationOh, best believe it happened, and is still happening. Just to review the hits:
   1. DTCC and/or Retail brokers prevent buying, artificially suppressing demand for Thu price drop and locking up people's money till they could transfer elsewhere.
   2. Sudden increases to margin requirements and severe margin calling
   3. A massive media campaign to announce shorts closed positions and everyone is in Silver
   4. Retail brokers cancelling orders, restricting limit prices, enforcing unwanted stop losses (eToro),
   5. Illegal coordinated short ladder attacks to drive down price and fish for stop losses and paper hands.

&#x200B;

**OK, BUT YOU KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS**

***WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY?***

&#x200B;

No, really, I'm asking. Our advantage is in our ability to crowdsource information. I will edit and update this list as information is shared. Meanwhile I'll try to flesh out a framework as best I can.

**Argument #1: The Squeeze is not Squoze because Short Interest is still high**

* Claim: As long as the Short Interest exceeds the Float, there is a supply problem for short sellers. This *may* translate into pressure from lenders on short sellers over time, driving the squeeze.
* Evidence needed: What is the current short interest?
   * S3 partners provides estimates using a model, and as of today claim it is only **51% of free float**:Source: [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752)

&#x200B;

* Ortex data provides another estimate using another model, and as of yesterday claims it is only 27 mil shares, only a million shares difference from S3Source: [https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts)

https://preview.redd.it/yo2s5e2cg5f61.png?width=1691&format=png&auto=webp&s=d83701a452b5aaa079e3a3948cecbbb3feb77b5a

&#x200B;

* **REAL DATA:** The SEC releases reported short interest twice a month. The most recent data we have is from Jan 15, and wasn't released to the public until Jan 27.\*\*On Jan 15 the SI was 131%.\*\*The next report for Jan 31 won't be available until Feb 9.Frankly, we can't rely on the REAL data, because it's delayed too long to be relevant.
* Evidence needed: What is the actual free float?
   * I still need help finding this. I know 71 Million shares have been issued overall, but a lot of that is locked up in institutions that would have to report any selloffs within 3 days. If 27 million shorts still need to close, how many shares are readily available?
   * Yahoo Finance puts Float at 46.89 mil shares, FWIWSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)

**Argument #2: There hasn't been enough trading volume for shorts to possibly close**

* Claim: assuming \~27 mil shorted, not enough shares exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions.
* Evidence: Someone explain to me how this isn't enough volume for shorts to cover. Mark Cuban said pretty much the same thing in his AMA today.

|Date|Trade Volume|
|:-|:-|
|2/2 Tue|77.8m|
|2/1 Mon|37.3m|
|1/29 Fri|50.5m|
|1/28 Thu|58.5m|
|1/27 Wed|93.3m|

**Argument #3: Short Sellers will are under pressure to close, so the squeeze is coming**

* Claim: Short sellers are bleeding money trying to outlast us with their losing positions, and will eventually prefer (or be forced) to close out the loss rather than be caught in the squeeze.
* Evidence needed: Shorts are (on average) in a losing position at current share price ($90), and can't just close right now at profit
* Evidence needed: Any external pressure on shorters to close their position at a loss rather than waiting us out for the price to drop further

&#x200B;

**Argument #4: Market manipulation shenanigans didn't work, and retailers didn't sell off en masse, creating the liquidity shorts need to close cheaply.**

* Claim: Price dips happened during low volume trading (short ladder market manipulation etc), and the longs are holding fast.
* Counterevidence: THE MOTHERFUCKING $300 PRICE DROP YOU DUMB FUCKING NUGGETS
* Evidence: This popular screenshot of Fidelity's order ratio:Source: [https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)

https://preview.redd.it/5jnmtl00l5f61.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9e676fbd3e0811f826463f14d4b9c12971ed6b2

* Counterargument: Order counts don't mean shit. For every share traded there is a buyer and a seller. So 100k buyers buy one share each, and 40k sellers sell 3 shares each. Or 20k buyers place 5 buy orders for one share each, and there are less buyers than sellers overall. WHO KNOWS? This strikes me as very insufficient evidence for bullishness, serving only as confirmation bias for bagholders.
* **Evidence needed:** Something more concrete that better proves that more shareholders held than sold.
* Evidence needed: other brokerages data on buy vs sell orders. Fidelity is just one broker, and a retail broker at that. Hedgies don't trade with Fidelity.

&#x200B;

**Argument #5: The biggest dips were driven by short-ladder attacks during low volume periods**

* Claim: the decrease in price from 500 to 90 is mostly fueled by artificial suppression of demand and fake selling (short ladders), and not so much by change in momentum.
* Evidence: At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors. Essentially, round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual\_representation\_of\_a\_short\_ladder\_attack\_4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/)
   * [https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg)
* Counterargument: short ladder attacks are straight up not real, conspiracy theory confirmation bias invented by WSB itself: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short\_ladders\_are\_not\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short_ladders_are_not_real/)
* Evidence needed: I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts (100 shares at a time), could use that. \\
* Counterargument: The artificially reduced volume from Robin Hood and other brokers limiting access has now been largely removed, as RH allows 100 shares and by now people had time to transfer funds to another broker. Damage to momentum was done, but if there is still a valid thesis it should just mean people can buy the dip, right?
* Evidence needed: That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by massive trading volume. I'm seeing a lot, especially compared to Thursday's artificial suppression:

https://preview.redd.it/77a0euotp5f61.png?width=1884&format=png&auto=webp&s=62b0af04608cb5fb235895d8bbd03b9e19a00588

&#x200B;

**Argument #6: 'You are here on the VW short squeeze chart'**

* Claim: See how the famous VW short squeeze also had a massive price drop before it blew up? That's us right now.
* Evidence: A single, solitary chart

https://preview.redd.it/mx6fs2f5r5f61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=60cc9096c46097b7328c59c2572b3466e5241131

* Counterargument: the VW scenario was not the same as the GME play. VW share liquidity plummeted literally overnight when it was revealed that Porsche had bought up 90% of the float (check me on that fact, I'm repeating secondhand info). See the big dip AFTER the squeeze? How do we know we aren't *there*?
* Evidence needed: IDK, some kind of coherent explanation of why VW dipped like that, and why a similar dip would be expected in the GME Play

##If you haven't noticed,  all eyes are on /r/wallstreetbets right now and a certain narrative is being pushed around to make it seem as if this community is disorderly and reckless. What I think is happening is that you guys are making such an impact that these fat cats are worried that they have to get up and put in work to earn a living.    

##Some of these guys traditionally used the media as a tool for them to manipulate the market have failed to further line their pockets and now want to accuse you guys as being manipulators. This is complete nonsense because **ALL** content in /r/wallstreetbets is organic, created only by its users. You guys choose what you like and do what you want to do as individuals.

##There is **NO** organized effort by those us who moderate this community to *promote, advise or recommend any stock*.  It is against our policy to do so and we feel it is crucial to allow members to be able to share their ideas amongst each other with autonomy.  

##The only time we intervene is when we notice any unscrupulous characters appear thinking they can take advantage of our members.  We do our best to identify them quickly and remove them from our community.


##There have been accusations of some inappropriate conduct coming from this community. These are baseless accusations as I have not seen any evidence of this taking place here. You guys know better but I'm going to say it anyway for those who have only recently joined this community that we don't do that stuff here.
  
##People like to talk shit about you when you're a winner, it just comes with the territory.  The way a winner responds is by keeping your head up high and enjoy living rent-free inside the minds of those who doubted you. They'll stare you down as you walk by them with a smile as wide as the sky. You don't even notice them because you're too busy basking in all the glorious tendies you've made.  They hate that you played by the rules and still won.

##That fuzzy sensation you are feeling is called RESPECT and it is well earned.  Wall Street no longer dismisses your presence anymore. The smart ones know that you guys do things differently and will adapt in ways to accommodate you and how you as the next generation want things done.  You should all be proud of yourselves.

And I’d like to short it.

My plan is to withdraw cash like 100$ from them and deposit it with a different bank then transfer it back to them and withdraw the same 100 $ until they run out of physical cash. I would then go around and let people know that when I tired withdrawing money from them that there was no cash to withdraw. 

This in turn should cause a bank run and I’m assuming a decent amount of people would close their accounts leading for the stock price to fall.

la3ddb,2021-02-01 13:45:36,We should be compiling links of sources claiming WSB is for silver,"We’re not. Plain and simple. Anyone who frequents WSB knows this. 

This means whatever media source is indicating this to be the case is a sellout and their credibility should be in serious question since they either 1) don’t do their due diligence, or 2) are okay with getting their strings pulled to be used as tools by the wealthy to manipulate masses.

If there was any doubt of these hedge fund’s influence and manipulate, this whole “WSB going silver” just put that conspiracy theory to rest and only does more to confirm that the game has always been rigged against the average person.



**Edit:** You know what would be AMAZING?? This was an idea already thrown out there, but if the mods could use twitter (and by pinning a statement on this subreddit) to invalidate the silver BS... That would be SUCH a great fucking move. Maybe a message like **""There is no sentiment among WSB members to buy SLV stock and the little that exists is under scrutiny of WSB members""**. That would just slam the door on any sources propagating that false information and call them out on their BS (because it's just so obviously untrue). It would also make it clear for those checking the credibility of this fake news that the silver hype is a fabrication by variables outside of WSB and inform them of how convenient it is for hedge funds if people pulled from GME, and supported a stock they own massive shares of.

This goes without saying that I'm holding GME till the very end. Given how the media and some brokerages have gotten involved (and in a not so subtle way that benefits the hedge funds), it's not even about the money anymore. And that's coming from someone with student loans who stands to profit by exiting right now. Money comes and goes, but getting to witness firsthand just how rigged the system is and knowing **who's** involved in keeping people in line is just something you can't put a price tag on.",34141,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la3ddb/we_should_be_compiling_links_of_sources_claiming/,wallstreetbets

How stupid are people that they can actually believe this? YEAH when I'm talking over collusion and market manipulation with the fucking white house I make sure all my IT people can hear me. YEAH totally normal for low-level people to know the intimate details of highly-sensitive conversations.

I can literally make a post right now that suggests your mom traded a cut of that ass to robinhood to restrict buying gme and it would be just as credible. Hell it's even more plausible

Why do you keep doubling down on your short positions? Why are new hedge funds are coming in and scooping up new short positions? What the fuck are you shitstains on society doing? What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you understand who we are?

We don’t fucking play here. We lose money for fucking breakfast. Every day. And then we come back and lose even more fucking money. We buy out of the money weeklies on fucking THURSDAYS. We don’t give a fuck. This is what we do. We do this. We don’t fucking play around. We come here to risk it all. We come here to YOLO our children’s college funds away just to post memes about it.

Your plan was really just to put us in a position where all we have to do is hold SHARES? Say less fam. I haven’t owned a share in four years. I sold AAPL AMD and ENPH calls last week just to buy shares of GameStop and fuck you up as much as possible so we can make memes about it.

Double down, triple down, quadruple down, take every penny of your rich boomer clients money and put it on the table. Sink the entire already artificially propped up economy over it. We know you will. And because we know you will, we are going to make you do it. Just like the coyote blindly chasing the roadrunner off of a fucking cliff. Chop off your whole head to spite your face. 

Take all your boomer ass money and put it on the table. We are here for it. My shares are available for $10,000 before 6 pm today. For every hour after that, Im asking another $250.

l7q1et,2021-01-29 11:11:53,Robinhood Is Lying - You Are Blocked Acquiring More Than 5 Total Shares,"Vlad, CEO of RH and chief mod at r/cuckold, went on national news outlets last night and swore RH would open trading of GME. 

That is not entirely true. 

RH is allowing anyone with ZERO shares of GME to buy up to 5.  Anyone with currently less than 5 shares can buy more up to a total portfolio of 5 shares.  Anyone with more than 5 shares can not purchase shares. 

This is important because these fuck clowns know that those of us carrying greater numbers of stock likely have the capacity to buy greater numbers of GME shares and reduce liquidity. 

They are simultaneously:
1)  manipulating the system
2) taking advantage of people with less funds
3) preventing a greater number of shares from being purchased

They did this so they could have a talking point in the media and during their congressional investigations and say “We reopened stock purchase of GME” and nobody will dig deeper. 

This is fucking dirty ass pool and fucking outright manipulation. 

Here’s the video proof:  https://imgur.com/a/AV3IGMa

Edit: and yes.  I do have other brokerage accounts and those are working fine. Shout out to my homies at SoFi, Fidelity, and Vanguard. I have GME stashed in those accounts too.

Edit 2: I’m not giving a pass to those fucks at other brokers too. Thomas “The Shit Engine” Fluffer at IBKR can eat a bag of fucking rotten cocks too.  Saying GME is worth $17 and the stock should be restricted until it drops to $17 because it’s overvalued.  Fuck you Fluffer. You know what’s overvalued at $17? Your shitty blowjobs. You give really shitty head you old lemon party fuck. ^no ^homo

Edit 3: RH has now dropped the shares you can buy to 2 shares. If you hold more than 2 shares you can not buy shares.  Go use another broker.  Fuck IBKR, Fuck RH and fuck the hedge funds and brokers.  They are gaming this entire thing.  Go ahead share this post with anyone not on reddit.  Everyone needs to know they are being bent over and violated without lube.  Market got caught doing retarded shit (shorting over 200% of GME) and now we all are suddenly the retards.  GO GET FUCKED Vlad the Cock Impaler and Thomas Fluffer and all of you fuck clowns.

Edit 4: Dear SEC - When GME was trading and trending above $350 is when RH and others dropped the share buy limit to 2 shares.  This is coordinated and planned manipulation.  $350 matters because if GME continues to trade consistently above $350 then gamma squeeze occurs for todays closing options.  This is coordinated and premeditated manipulation.

Here’s the proof of the new 2 share limit: https://i.imgur.com/RhwgoRu.jpg

#Edit 5: I made a comment that RH was stealing a share from my account.  We all have moments of retardation.  Some of us, like me, dwell in the retard.  I was wrong and I appreciate other redditors pointing out my mistake.  I've delete the comments and posts I made elsewhere.  RH has done enough shit wrong but disinformation, unintentional or not, is not what we are about.  I apologize for the honest mistake.  But fuck RH, IBKR, and the hedge funds anyway.  Nothing changes.

#I'm NOT FUCKING SELLING.

I started off with 32k. I was selling puts on DWAC for a couple weeks and that was gaining me about $500-$1000/wk. i then started selling puts on the SPY and realized I could do an iron condor and sell credit spreads on calls as well. I sold spreads $1 apart in strike and put up $100 in collateral for each iron condor chain. 

On Tuesday I had an iron condor which closed OTM on both sides but robinhood still closed my position for a loss of 9k before expiration (when I was due to collect all premium). I let this go, because I realized it was an oversight on my part to not realize robinhood would close them out. 

Wednesday, I made back 25k

Thursday, the s and p dropped and my spreads became deep ITM. At this point I was only selling put credit spreads, no longer doing iron condors. By end of day Thursday, my account dropped below 25k. I deposited an additional 10k

On Friday, I received a notification that because my account dropped below 25k Thursday, that my instant deposit limit was reduced from 25k to 10k.I started rolling my spreads from 12/16 to 12/23 for either a 0.0 credit or 0.2 debit. Mid way through this, they put a restriction on my account and did not let me trade until I closed out my 12/16 and accepted the loss of collateral, rather than roll the positions. I spent hours on chat support.

I sold my position. And cleared up the call.

Today, after market I received this email stating I need to deposit $4.4MILLION or close all my positions by 12/20 eod. When my deposit from last week, clears on their end 12/21. My app says I only am in a deficit of $776. I don’t know how I’m in a deficit at all. All my positions are covered and nothing has been exercised.

I'm known for never getting the fuck off this sub and collecting tax payer money as I do it. Seriously you'll see me here 24 fucking 7 even when I'm ""working""

I'm going to give you the quick rundown on Wallstreetbets culture for you newcomers to get acclimated or if you're a CNBC boomer not knowing what the fuck is going on in this sub.

# First of all lets go over lingo/slang:

**FD** (stands for ""f"" word (no not fuck the other F word) delight)

\-*To buy an FD is to buy a weekly option that is so fucking retarded it might just work*

**Retard**

\-*It means your fucking stupid and don't know what the fuck you're doing*

**Autistic**

\-*Use autistic to describe someone that actually does due diligence and knows what they are doing*

**First one is free**

\-*A phenomena where you are so retarded and don't know what the fuck your doing you somehow make money on your first trade*

**Ban**

\-*When you say or ask something so fucking retarded someone has requested a mod to ban you*

**Diamond Hands** 💎✋

\-*It means you never sell. Your hands are literally made of diamonds*

**Toilet Paper Hands 🧻✋**

\-*You sell at the slightest red tick because you're overleveraged and are a pussy.*

**In Scrambles**

\-*when somebody has made a poor decision and is regretting it*

**Europoors**

\-*When the European stock markets open up and they start selling because they lack economic stimulus.*

**Ameririch**

\-*When US stock markets open and they buy up what Europoors sold*

**YOLO**

\-*$400 into GME weeklies is not a YOLO you dumb fuck. A YOLO should be atleast 4 digits and represent 98-100% of your account*

**$ROPE**

\-*what you buy when you make a poor decision*

**Smooth Brain**

\-*apparently the grooves in your brain determines your intelligence. To have a smooth brain means to have no grooves which means you're fucking retarded.*

**FOMO (fear of missing out)**

\-*when everybody getting paid and you feel left out.*

**Guh**

\-*when you account goes from $4000 to $0 in 30 seconds*

**DD** (Due Diligence)

\-*It means doing your homework on a specific stock or the overall market*

**BTFD** (Buy the Fucking Dip)

\-*Something Warren Buffet said*

**Plunge Protection Team (PPT)**

\-*When the money printer gets turned on and prevents a drill from drilling further*

**Tendies**

\-*money*

**Mooning 🚀🚀🚀**

\-*Either means a stock went up 0.05% or 600%*

**Drilling / Drill team 6**

\-*Either means a stock went down -0.05% or -50%*

**Pleas fly again**

\-*what you say when your stock takes a shit*

**""We like the stock""**

\-*Recent meme popularized by Jim Cramer in regards to Gamestop when he tried to imitate Wallstreetbets users*

**Jerome Powell / Daddy**

\-*The chairman of the Federal Reserve. Blessed us with 0% interest rates causing stocks to only go up. Literally prints money.*

**SEC (Securities exchange commission)**

\-*Stock market police*

**Black Swan**

\-*when your chillin and some shit pops off that makes the stock market moon or drill*

**Deepfuckingvalue**

\-*Autist who held GME for nearly 2 years*

**Mods are gay**

\-*self explanatory*

**Buy High Sell low**

*-what you do as a newcomer.*

&#x200B;

No you don't need to report users who call you retarded.

No you don't need to report users that say they fucked your wife while her boyfriend watches

No you don't need to report users for saying you probably do blowjobs behind the wendys.

If somebody says ""nobody tell him"" they are not being a dick you are just so fucking retarded because your question is probably basic shit you should know before investing.

# Gang Life

On your adventure throughout Wallstreetbets you'll notice some retards representing different types of ""gangs"" heres a quick guide to what they stand for.

**Bear Gang / Gay bears / Virgin traders 🌈🐻**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go down*

*Note: ""gay bear"" in NOT an alternative to calling someone ""retard"". Being called gay bear is 100x worse, true story.*

**Bull Gang / Big Dongus Crew 🐂**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go up*

**Kang Gang 🦘**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go way up and then way down*

**Theta Gang θ**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go sideways*

**Cash gang 💵**

# Surviving as a newcomer

Don't ask retarded questions that are basic such as:

* ""What is an option?""
* ""Should I buy X stock?""
* ""Is it too late?""
* ""What is IV?""
* ""Why can't I trade"" and the market is fucking closed
* ""What are futures?""

All this basic shit will piss off some degenerates because if you don't know any of this there is really no reason for you to be throwing 10k at weeklies you'll lose 99% of the time.

&#x200B;

Not only is it against the rules but nobody gives a fuck about your political thoughts. The only thing we care about on this sub is fucking gay bears and losing money. With this much people in a sub there is bound to be political commentary and I'd advise you to take it to a different sub.

I think the large players are starting to realize they need to take the retards on reddit seriously. I think they're attempting to astroturf the investing subreddits by giving awards to tickers they have a vested interest in. And at this moment, that's anything that isn't GME. They know that once the prevailing enthusiasm subsides they'll have the opportunity to close.

Stay wary and stay vigilant my comrades. This is a war of attrition.

When you think of WEBER you think all things American: summer days, hot babes in bikinis, beer, hamburgers, & dads, & dad bods. 

Are you even American if you don't BBQ on a Weber?

[Weber Grills $WEBR](https://preview.redd.it/x9vtnvh7zat81.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bcf9c194d022e863cd86ee66286aa27607d98be)

Weber only IPO in Aug of 2021. Since then this stock has gotten beaten down. 

**52wk high: $20.44**                                              **52 wk low: $8.56**

Hedgies decided to short America's favorite past time: BBQS & happiness. We must do this for the American Dream & short squeeze gains. 

**We going for a short squeeze, boys.**

**This short squeeze has an absolutely perfect set up: we just need volume.** 

Weber $WEBR has a **2.83 billion dollar market cap**, but the **float is only $16.82 million shares**. The current short interest is at an **egregious 40.08% short interest (6.74 million shares of the free float).** The cost to borrow avg is 32.38% with the max at 74.75%. There are no additional shares available to short.  This stock is primed and ready to be squeezed.

What does this mean? It means we're having grilled tendies on our new Weber.

Let's squeeze these shorts for dads who throw back beers & sling steaks. For the babes who eat bubba burgers. 

**For the American Dream.**

181snlr,2023-11-23 04:15:56,NVDA is cooking their books. And so are others.,"Here is their latest earnings report: https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/NVIDIA-10Q.pdf

Their net income for Q3 2023 is $17B.  However their account receivable has gone up to $8B from $3B in Q1 2023. (page 4-5)

Which means they have declared net income of approximately $5B this year which are ""account receivable""

> Accounts receivable refer to the outstanding invoices that a company has or the money that clients owe the company. The phrase refers to accounts that a business has the right to receive because it has delivered a product or service. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivable.asp

Their AR is increasing every quarter which means they are lending out their products to customers .
AR is negative for Revenue Recognition Practices: This situation might raise questions about the company's revenue recognition practices. There could be concerns about whether the company is aggressively recognizing revenue without a firm basis for believing the receivables will be collected.

So what's happening: NVDA is handing out products on credit to customers. There is no guarantee the revenue will materialize especially if the product is given on credit to startups that fail.


Historical Precedents:
Dot-com Bubble: During the dot-com bubble, many companies reported high revenues but had equally high receivables. This was a red flag that revenues were being recognized aggressively without ensuring collectibility.


Million dollar question: Can you short it? NO.

The stock market is like a Quantum Mechanics. Observing it will change the outcome. That is, the stock market will ALWAYS move against retail bets. Do you feel like you are in a truman show where every play you make moves against you? That's because the stock market is designed algorithmically & psychologically against the herd. 

The market news (almost 100% of them are owned by hedge funds) and all the technical signals exist just to gas light you into playing a position that is guaranteed to lose.

This is not exclusive to NVDA. A huge chunk of companies reporting have significantly higher Account Receivable in their earning reports pumping up their ER.

But there is nothing you I can do. 

It's all just the same thing over and over; we can't help ourselves. And you and I can't control it, or stop it, or even slow it. Or even ever-so-slightly alter it. We just react. And we make a lot money if we get it right. And we get left by the side of the side of the road if we get it wrong. And there have always been and there always will be the same percentage of winners and losers. Happy foxes and sad sacks. Fat cats and starving dogs in this world. Yeah, there may be more of us today than there's ever been.

nsgeln,2021-06-04 21:47:13,AMC target is $20 (don't hate the messenger).,"I have no DD to share. I care about price action only. Price action for me is now bearish.

1. Parabola broke today. That's a big problem imo. Parabolic advances tend to retrace 70-80% of the advance.
2. $44.80 is the 5MA on the daily chart and in after hours were now trading below that.
3. We've broken the support level at $46.50.

When the parabola broke today I did buy some puts on amc (at a ridiculous 500% IV) . So I do have a bias here. My target on AMC is $20-$24 area. I'm sure I'll get downvoted into oblivion but thought I would share my position and my reasoning behind it.

Peeps asking for proof of position. Here ya go. Positions opened yesterday when AMC cracked the parabola. Plan is to exit by Wednesday with around a 50% gain if all goes well. Depending on how it plays out I might open a long spot position on AMC at $20 next week. I don't hate AMC or anything just see an opportunity to profit on the way down and just as content to profit on the way back up.

Hello silver surfers, clang gang, and monkeys who enjoy shiny things

Thank you for helping [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) go viral and make it on Zerohedge (dreams fulfilled).

Before I get GME hate mail, let me clarify I am still long GME and am looking for the moon in GME.  I also have a small long silver position.  Both positions are quite small as I am unfortunately not super well capitalized.  Many of the comments about buys on the previous post referenced order sizes I can only dream of at the moment, but I'm damn glad we have so much conviction behind this trade.

I created an official [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/Thehappyhawaii1/status/1355663208774836228?s=20). Not sure if I’ll use it, but didn’t want anyone to impersonate me.

Clang gang acted so fast, that all the bullion dealers sold out over the weekend which is incredible, and overnight futures are spiking as we speak.  I continue to support the purchase of physical silver as a way to continue the short squeeze if you can find any of course.  The short squeeze thesis is built upon tying up as much of the physical silver into our diamond hands as possible.  With that said, I thought I would add some clarity to my position on the various options out there to play the silver squeeze.

**It is organized into 2 sections:**

**1. the futures market (for big players)**

**2. alternatives (for smaller players**)

&#x200B;

**1.**

**The futures market:** for the squeeze to really happen, we desperately need some of the bigger pocketed players who have access to the futures market to purchase silver contracts on the open market.  **If you can play in the futures market, it is imperative that you do so.**  I have been trying to find a retail broker who will allow customers to take physical delivery rather than force cash settlement but have had no luck so far.  If anyone knows of such a retail broker, please let me know so I can update the post with the info.  This is by far the most important piece of the short squeeze equation.

Let me explain:

When traders hold long futures contracts to expiration, they are making a statement that they want to take delivery.  Taking delivery does not mean the silver is transferred to your house, but rather it goes to the CME warehouse.  You can go pick it up from the warehouse or arrange transfer, or you can pay $8.50 a month per 1000 ounces to just store it at the warehouse (which is quite cheap at that scale).  The futures market allows players to use extreme amounts of margin and leverage, which is where the 'naked shorts' come from.  They are able to sell massive amounts of silver with very little collateral to back it up, and no actual silver on hand.  **This also explains why institutions such as citadel or others hold positions in the ETFs like SLV.** If you have more than 50,000 shares in SLV, you can request to have your share of the silver delivered to you.  They are hedging against their naked shorts in the futures market by trying to gain access to a source of silver should they need it.  The thing is, if the short squeeze occurs, even their holdings in SLV will not be enough to meet their obligations.

In order for the buyers to call their bluff they need to not use their margin power, as tempting as it may be to do so.  They need to only purchase as much silver in the futures market as they actually have money in their account to cover the final purchase (the price is locked in at the time of the futures contract purchase).  Then as expiration approaches, refuse to settle in cash, and pony up the money to actually buy the silver and have it delivered.  At that time the seller needs to find silver fast, and tries to purchase it from somewhere else to meet their contractual obligations.  The rush of all the naked shorts to try and find physical silver is what massively drives up the price and causes the short squeeze.

There may even be dips in the futures market if the buyers are planning to do the squeeze.  This is because they will not be using margin whiles the seller are.  The sellers may be able to push the price down temporarily, but when expiration comes they will find themselves in one hell of a bind when they find out all of the buyers actually have the cash in their accounts to take delivery and refuse to settle in cash.

As the supply of silver dries up and literally there is no way to fulfill the obligations of the long contract holders, the silver futures market will actually be effectively shut down.  The CME will force settle all remaining contracts for cash at the current market rate (which will have spiked dramatically).  This is the last thing the CME wants to do, and will only do it as a final last resort.  If this occurs we can declare victory at having exposed the silver futures market for the fraud that it is.  A futures market is built on the trust that the sellers can actually deliver the product they are selling, and if they can't then that trust is destroyed.  If you go long and they don't have the silver to give you, you will still be paid the money for that amount of silver at the going rate.

Following this collapse the futures market will relaunch at a 1-1 margin requirement.  This means that for every silver ounce sold, the seller will actually have to have the silver or at least the collateral to cover that exact amount of silver on the open market.  The futures market will have moved from 250-1 paper to physical, to 1-1.  The massive banks who were naked short will have lost tens or maybe even hundreds of billions of dollars collectively.  In my previous post I implied it was likely JP Morgan naked shorting.  They have a history of doing so and being fined for manipulation, but we don't actually know which big players are the current naked shorts and who might even be net long.

**2.**

**This is where the rest of us come in...** if you can't play the futures market, you can still purchase and tie up physical silver where the naked shorts can't access it.  Thus setting up the environment for the squeeze to occur.  Whether its WSB players or some other big fund who sees what is happening and does the futures part themselves, they will only be able to do so because of the smaller purchases of silver by millions of smaller players.

**Physical silver:** by purchasing physical silver you are taking silver off the market that the shorts will need when the squeeze occurs.  You aren't directly causing the short squeeze, you are helping to set up the environment for the squeeze to occur, and you will have the silver to sell after the squeeze happens.

**Silver ETFs (SLV, PSLV, SIVR):** this is the same concept as the physical silver.  By purchasing silver ETFs you are locking up physical into the ETF's vaults, which wont be able to be able to be purchased by the shorts in the futures market because they belong to the ETF shareholders.  There has been a ton of chatter about whether ETFs should be used at all, and of the ETFs which is the best or most reliable.  Frankly if you have doubts about the ETFs, just don't use them.  All of the physical silver is already sold out so this is the easiest way for most people to play at this point.  If you prefer physical but it’s sold out or selling for ridiculous premiums, just buy the ETFs until the premiums come down and then sell the ETF to purchase more physical. It is possible that at some point SLV (or other ETFs) will no longer create new shares as silver becomes impossible to find (thus they cant create a new share because they can't the silver to back it up).   At that point the ETFs will likely trade at a hefty premium to NAV and it may no longer make sense to purchase them.  But that hasn't occurred yet so I'd say it still certainly makes sense to buy these ETFs.  We have no proof that they are lying about their silver holdings, and if they disallow new share creation, I'd say that means they really aren't lying about their holdings, otherwise they would happily take as much investment as we would give them to collect management fees.

**Call options on Silver ETFs:** Calls will have a similar effect to purchasing the ETFs as the market maker will have to purchase the underlying ETF to be hedged.  It has a levered effect that can both hurt and help the squeeze depending on which direction the silver price is headed.

**Miners:** miners will benefit from the squeeze but buying them doesn't help the squeeze occur in any direct way.  People buying miners will benefit if we are successful, but the more capital that flows into them rather than the alternatives, it will lower the chances of the squeeze being successful in the first place.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

**if monke have lot of money, long futures with no margin and take delivery.**

**If monke not have lot of money, buy physical silver bullion and PSLV**

Hopefully this answered some of the questions that flooded my inbox from the previous post.  Good luck to all.  GME and SLV to moon.  Lets squeeze the naked shorts, expose the manipulation, and take our tendies from the hedge funds.

I am not saying the populist anger isn’t justified or that our system is not flawed or that these hedge funds didn’t fuck up by shorting something with such a large short float. But sometimes it’s good to stay calm and analyze things rationally and consider the following opinions from someone who was burned by the short selling ban in 2008 and lost my shirt with my puts in 2012 betting on a cascading bank failure in European when Draghi announced LTRO. There are a lot of things that can go wrong with the infinite money machine thesis.

The more the price of GME rises, the likelihood that the SEC will institute a short term trading ban on the stock increases. But vegaseller, you say, we will just Hold and when it resumes  our infinite money wormhole will work again, time is on our side, the shorts have massive margins interests which are compounding.

The problem will be when a private deal is negotiated between GME management and a short seller consortium. It is highly likely there are already negotiations underway between some individual short sellers and the company on a private deal to issue new shares at a significant premium, although much lower than the current market price. Management will be happy to double the shares outstanding at anywhere from $20-100 shares/share, a considerably discount to the current share price. Their concerns are retiring their existing debts and generating cash on their balance sheet for a pivot rather than maintaining their current shares price.

And the higher the run-up in GME share price, the greater the incentive for short sellers to form a consortium and reach a private deals with management and the greater incentive for management to close a deal towards a higher price range. Once a deal is largely settled, they will loop the SEC in to institute a temporary trading halt on the stock. 

If this happens, you guys would be left holding the bag and the share price could easily drop to $10-$50.

There is no shame in taking some money out. Just here to point out how the shorts can still get out at a much lower cost than you think.

So. I've been daytrading since around June of last year. As you can see from my all-time chart, it was a rough journey. I started in 2017 and found wallstreet bets, I was originally trading JNUG and shit like that, which was pretty popular on the sub back in the day. I evolved my strategy to basically ""buy calls on big tech"" and yeah...it worked out. I actually cashed out on a downswing because Merril Lynch gave you access to a higher quality trading platform and information if your account size was over 75k or something like that, so at the end of the day on that original push I ended up making enough to buy my house for cash, around 180k. Think it was facebook calls?

After that, I thought of myself as hot shit and every year around my birthday, I would use the distribution from my family's company as fuel for a robinhood degen spree. Ended up blowing up like 4 accounts? Maybe 60-70k total. Pretty gross stuff.

But then, around 2020 DEC I inherited a fat chunk of money because we sold our family business. Was like 3.4m after taxes. I put a few mil into robinhood and just let it ride. If you check the charts, that was literally RIGHT BEFORE the covid fuckery. I invested at the absolute PEAK of the market. Kinda poor timing with regards to inheriting money and trying to be responsible, but no complaints obviously, free money is free.

After that, I tolerated the pain and was just watching the market. Around my birthday again in June, after getting my asshole reamed for like 6 months I said FUCK IT I can do better than just letting this shit do what it wants to do. I started trading.

Originally, it was mostly theta gang. As you can see, that was relatively successful. That ended when the market climbed over 400. I started daytrading, probably by feb/march of 2023?

Anyway, I've had about two YOLOS where I was 7 figures invested in options a few months out. That first fuckery, I ended up profiting about 85k which was insane. The stress was unreal and I was down A LOT at one point in time. The second yolo was more recently, the charts don't do it justice but I was down about 200k+ at one point in time as well. Ended up selling that second one for a 20k loss.

After that second YOLO you can see I became more disciplined again, its like a 40 degree angle straight up with very little deviation. It was a kick in the ass/wake-up call for sure.

Anyway...my strategy is based both on TA: resistances/support, and being somewhat cautious when getting into a position. I generally will only buy like 20% of what I'm willing to risk at any given time, and if it moves against me I will average into the position. I will sell for about .10 a contract.

I just daytrade, the times when I'm holding overnight are usually because mistakes were made and I misjudged a resistance/support but had enough conviction not to cut my losses.

Usually I will buy another 20% when my original position is down like .10, and continue to average down as it moves in a meaningful direction against my position. Sometimes I will sell for a breakeven or a bit more than .10 profit.

Honestly? A lot of what I do is based on TA that is informed by gut feelings. I've literally spent thousands of hours watching the market over the last 6-7 years even when not trading it. I couldn't accurately explain why I do what I do and its probably impossible to replicate.

But overall? I'd say there are a few over-arching rules that will make you more money in the long run.

&#x200B;

One: Don't go balls deep into a position regardless of how convinced you are of it. Decide what you're willing to risk and only go like 20% max at first to leave yourself room to average down if it moves against you. This will make it so if even you're wrong about the exact pricing, if you're correct about the general movement of the stock you can still make profit.

Two: Be patient. If you've identified what a good entry point for your position is, then stick to that. Stick to your guns. Theres been plenty of times where I missed an entry because it didn't quite hit my price target, you just shrug it off and move on with your life. There will be more opportunities later in the day, or opportunities in other stocks, so don't beat yourself up over it.

Three: Take profits. Just do it. Before you enter a trade, you should have an entry point and an exit point identified and if you sell at your exit point for profit, then good job. Just take profits.

Four: Don't have any regrets. Analyze your decision making process, and if it was based on rationality as opposed to emotion then don't regret your choices. Every trade is a new thing. Even if you end up buying back in at a lower price than you sold your previous position at, if its based on rational choices then don't regret it. Take your profits as they come.

Five: Self Analysis. Dig into why you made the choices that you made. If its emotionally based, then learn to recognize those emotions and what causes them and counterbalance that shit. Otherwise...yeah...always analyze your trades.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Yeah you're a bitch if you can't focus long enough to read this post and you deserve to lose money. Go fuck yourself.",0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15tsz31/daytrading_430k/,wallstreetbets

 Many here will immediately downvote this because they do not want you to consider any potential future other than the rosy, all your dreams will come true picture they've been hyping over the last several days. They want you to hold no matter what happens. That's not because it's in your best interests but because it's in theirs.  They'll tell you to ignore the naysayers. Ignore those trying to keep you from achieving your dreams and that anyone telling you to do anything other than HOLD is a corporate shill working for the hedge funds. Now ask yourself, why? 

What you have to remember is that you are playing against the smartest, most well capitalized and technologically sophisticated people and organizations on the planet.  Yes this is an unprecedented event, but that doesn't mean there aren't ways for this to be resolved and avoiding the infinity squeeze that everyone here is praying for.  You're fighting an uphill battle against a relatively small number of organizations that are playing both sides of this trade already. 

**There's still time to limit your downside risk**

Gains and losses don't exist until you exit your position. Until then, all you have is a paper gain or a paper loss.  If you have gains, you should take some money off of the table. If you have losses, ask yourself how you would feel if you woke up tomorrow and that money was gone. If you are truly ok with that, then by all means, ride this roller-coaster to its end, whatever that end may be. If not, however, you should really think twice about whether you are ok with that.  

**THIS ISN'T FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). THIS IS COMMON SENSE**

I'm ok losing the remaining holdings i have in $GME. This is a small amount of my personal portfolio. Many on here may not be in the same position. I've read countless threads and posts of people taking their last dollar, siphoning credit cards for cash advances, taking loans on their homes...it's insane. Yes it's a unique situation, but the professional traders who have done this and do this every day, all day for years and years can act faster than you, have a strategy and have the capital to chip away at this making money regardless of what happens going forward.  

**Wallstreetbets is not some magical subreddit with inside info and guaranteed path to millions** 

there are some very smart people here, don't get me wrong. I've made a lot of money that i never would have had i not dug into the info that I was first exposed to here.  But, for every legitimately smart investor/trader/autist on the sub, there's a cohort of people who want nothing more than to separate others from their money and have no qualms about manipulating you and your desire for an easy win. It's human nature and it's been happening for as long as people could understand the concept of easy money.  If you've read the recent reports on Silver, that's an example of a small group of well-coordinated people taking advantage of the situation with newbies and others who may not even be on here. That said, im limiting this to $GME. 

**NOBODY IS GOING TO TELL YOU IT'S TIME TO SELL. THEY'LL ONLY TELL YOU WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD**

It's easy to get everyone on board with idea to buy, and when you're being told the price can go to $10,000 (I've actually seen people legitimately saying it could go much higher), the price you buy at doesn't matter. The same cannot be said for the price at which you sell.  Reading the threads, it might feel like everyone is acting in concert, but not everyone on here is honest. Not everyone here is doing what they say they're doing. Not everyone here gives a damn about you, even if they say they do. Don't allow your confirmation bias to convince yourself to do something you know inside is a bad decision. Invest only what you can afford to lose - period. 

**Winning a war against Wall St. sounds great, but you really need to understand what you're up against**

Shares are bought and sold by professionals in fractions of a second. In the time it took you to read this, the price of GME has fluctuated by as much as $60.  Those who want to pull on your emotions are going to do whatever they can to have you focus on the Us against Them argument, but the fact of the matter is Robinhood isn't a very well capitalized organization, which is why they aren't allowing larger share purchases. Other brokers that don't have the volume that RH has had are taking orders without restriction, but that's because they have not yet hit the level of volume where their clearing capabilities and capital requirements will come into play. If everyone from RH suddenly went to WeBull  for example, you'd likely see the same thing happen there once volume in GME spiked. 

&#x200B;

BE SAFE. BE SMART. RISK ONLY WHAT YOU CAN LOSE. 

TL/DR: Think for yourself and make decisions based on your own risk tolerance. There are people acting in their own best interests who need you to act in a certain way in order for it to work. This is a zero-sum game. if there's going to be winners, there have to be losers.",41,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la84a0/if_you_got_caught_up_in_the_gme_frenzy_and_are/,wallstreetbets

CEO Aaron sold 7m worth of stock 

NEW EDIT: AMC just announced in their 10k to pursue dilutive equity raises ( debt for equity swaps)

Citing: 

Other Creditor Discussions. While the liquidity we have raised has substantially extended our liquidity runway, the new debt we have issued, together with the higher interest rate payments that will be required in the future but have largely been deferred, will substantially increase our leverage and future cash requirements. These future cash requirements, like our deferred rent obligations, will present a challenge to our long-term viability if our operating income does not return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Even then, we believe we will need to engage in discussions with our creditors to substantially reduce our leverage. We expect to continue to explore alternatives that include new-money financing, potentially in connection with converting debt to equity, which would help manage our leverage but would be dilutive to holders of our common stock. We expect we will continue to receive from and discuss proposals with all classes of creditors. These discussions may not result in any agreement on commercially acceptable terms.


EDIT: I feel like I should respond here to some comments below:

\- Everything I said is factual. It's all linked to the official SEC docs of AMC or Bloomberg as a reliable source. 

\- Its a fact that share count increased to 450m. its a fact that roughly 50m shares are shorted.. .its a fact that even if you add in all the call options you barely get to any squeeze .. these are all facts

\- the fact that I have access to a Bloomberg terminal does not make any difference

\- If you really think I want to drive the share price by posting here.. sorry you are bloody stupid then. AMC trades like 2.5bn every day!!.. Mr bag holder dildo with his 50 shares has no influence lol 

\- yes my account is new. I looked at this once my friends asked me whether to invest in AMC or GME. I know AMC very very very well. I never looked at GME. 

\- I find it irresponsible that unsophisticated people with little money gamble away all their savings by being tricked into a Hoax

\- I did this post so ppl can get the facts right 

&#x200B;

/End of Edit

I have been flagging dilution at AMC before and I want to touch on this further in this DD.

# 1. AMC increased its share count from roughly 100m to 450m in the last few month alone.

This is a link to AMC latest quarterly release:

[https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0a2146ef-7cb0-43b1-b96f-33c1681e146e.html](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0a2146ef-7cb0-43b1-b96f-33c1681e146e.html)

**Lets count just how many shares have been issued:**

From the above picture: 15+15+20+200+50+44.4 = 344.4 . this compares to a starting share count of 103.8m so total shares out is now 448m (and that does not include all the restricted stock options management issued to themselves)

Which I estimate is another 6m.

 Bottom line share count went up by 4.5x

 And this is all float.. no institutional holders.. (Wanda converted there B shares to A shares to sell them)

# 2. Furthermore the company will keep issuing more shares.

They have another 70m left to issue which will likely be issues in the next days to come.

And … here it comes:

The company just filed an Annul general meeting to increase the share count by another 500m.

See this link:

[http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/9f348412-ec88-4159-a092-631da0404d66.html](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/9f348412-ec88-4159-a092-631da0404d66.html)

# Operationally it’s a severely struggling business:

\- The company burned through 125m a month in Q4

\- That burn will step up to 150m per month in H2 as management has stated at yday call.

\- They have 1bn of cash on hand but that will go down fast

\- Debt is now higher then pre corona and there is another 450m of unpaid rent

\- Share count is 4.5 pre covid .. so today’s share price really means around 48USD compred to pre covid dilution – pre covid it was trading at 6-8USD

\- Remember AMC wasn’t even able to generate any cash pre- covid

\- The stock rally has saved the debt holders because AMC might indeed be able to avoid bankruptcy.. but given the dilution the stock is still effectively worthless

There is not even that much squeeze potential:

# Lets look at the facts:

# 1. Stocks shorted 55.5m ??

That is a whopping ;) 12.3% of float…. And compares to 260m shares traded yday.. so to cover all shorts you need about 20% of the daily volume.

Stock is liquid to borrow

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fof2wnb7edm61.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=c73dcf2434b9d689a2246eabd1af28f5d0359c98

short interest

# 2. But what about a gamma squeeze ???

Again lets look at the facts.

The open interest in all calls is 1.27m .. against that we have 0.684m puts.

Lets totally ignore the puts which have a stable effect on the share price.. lets assume those don’t exist.

1.27m calls are equivalent to still a high number of 127m shares…

Many of these calls are out of the money..

But hey let's assume ALL the calls end up in the money.

That is 127m shares.. add that to the 55m shorted and you end up at 237m .. which is still only 50% of float!!

Also this compares to 1!!!!! Daily volume.. far from critical.

More realistically assuming a 30% delta and 50% put offset its more an extra 17m shares from calls.

This is not going to the moon.. The fundamentals are not there.

The reason why dildos get exited is that they look at outdated statistics about the shares outstanding and think it is sooo highly shorted.. but the fact is it isn’t.

&#x200B;

m7l0p0,2021-03-18 06:47:02,GME DISINFO EXPOSED #1: Why the “$GME MOASS’” post that hit the front page is pure BULLSHIT,"There’s a lot of misinformation going around WSB right now, and the common knowledge is that hedge funds shorting GME are the source of it. Unfortunately, common knowledge isn’t always correct knowledge. The reality is that much of the disinformation being spread on WSB right now is very pro-GME, and the new crowd here, which consists mostly of greenhorn traders (who don’t really understand how the market functions) is lapping it up. The [people — 600 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/) participating in this disinformation campaign often intentionally reach the wrong conclusions after overloading posts with very technical information that most greenhorn traders do not understand, or even just [make terms up](https://postimg.cc/B8W93Yth) — [Source — 18.5k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5zoos/gme_how_the_dip_today_was_due_to_etf_shares_being/)

There are many common tricks they use to positively manipulate sentiment surrounding GME. I wrote about it a bit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m68ybj/comment/gr6asm3?context=3). Unfortunately, that post was deleted by Automod when I edited a YouTube link into the text, and the mod team did not respond to requests to restore the post.

Regardless, I’ve noticed many of the same pro-GME talking points being recycled — often by brand new accounts that have a post history of begging for karma and posting exclusively about GME. You can love the stock, that’s fine, but if you *really* love the stock, it’s important to know how you’re being misled and lied to by posts that frequently hit the front page. In this thread, I’ll be addressing [this post — 21.1k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m79wdx/why_the_gme_moass_mother_of_all_short_squeezes_is/) specifically, and I’ll also be linking to similar shady posts that parrot the same baseless or misleading claims.

**Claim #1: GME is inversely-correlated with the broader market because the squeeze forces institutions to sell long positions to protect against margin calls**

There does seem to be *some* correlation between GME and the broader market, but this doesn’t imply causation (or shorts getting squeezed). It’s not uncommon for meme stocks to do well while the rest of the market is selling off. [Exhibit A](https://postimg.cc/PvGJgzYY) — [Exhibit B](https://postimg.cc/1VpXsnrT) — notice how RIOT’s peak in 2018 coincides with SPY’s trough? That’s correlation, but not causation. Why does this happen? I can’t say for sure, but my guess is that stocks like this have a lot of volatility, so when funds pull out of the broader market, they place their wealth in these volatile stocks as kind of a “store” of wealth until the sell-off is finished, at which point they cash out and re-enter the market. Just speculating, though.

What I *can* prove, however, is that the claim that the broader market and GME are inversely correlated is **complete bullshit**, and it takes only [the barest, most basic amount of research](https://postimg.cc/jDjfQcXS). Here, I’ve overlayed the S&P 500 with GME. If there were any correlation, you would see GME go down roughly whenever SPY went up, and vice-versa. Not good enough? Think GME ought to be valued as a tech company? [Nasdaq similary shows no correlation](https://postimg.cc/VdgMCpXh). Yes, I know the overlays aren’t perfect, but I’m working on an iPad here — cut me some slack. Regardless, you can see there is **no correlation**, proving that this part of Bows_N_Hoes post is **bullshit**.

For the record, I *do* think there was an inverse correlation between GME and the broader market back in February. In my opinion, there genuinely was a threat of system collapse. The IBKR chairman himself admitted that. (Request a link to the vid in comments and I’ll provide. I can’t post it in OP or my post will get whacked). In this case, hedge funds likely *did* have to sell some of their positions to free up liquidity so that they could cover or protect their shorts. This led to the broader market falling while GME squoze. As demonstrated, this correlation no longer exists.

Note: This claim is about inverse correlation is the same as [another unfounded claim — 4.4k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6if56/the_mythical_unicorn_aka_extremely_abnormal/) that hit the front page of WSB, and which one of WSB’s mods similarly dismantled.

**Claim 2: The illegal practice of naked short selling is causing the stock to show over 140% ownership**

The post claims that short shares are being invented out of thin air and sold on the market. While this is theoretically possible (but illegal!), this is pure speculation. So how then, might you ask, can a stock display over 100% ownership? When stocks are shorted, they are *borrowed* from someone who owns the stock, and then sold. Now, the same shares can be lent from one person to another to another. All of the entities borrowind the stock must report ownership of the stock. So, imagine it this way: I lend my dildo to my friend, and then *he* lends that dildo to *his* friend. I would report owning that dildo, my friend would report owning that dildo (albeit temporarily) and *his* friend would report owning that dildo. So you see how one single dildo can become three? [Investopedia even has an article about this](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp ). The same thing is happening to GME, and any claims that higher than 100% institutional ownership being indicative of the illegal practice of short selling is pure speculation, of which no one has yet provided proof.

**Claim #3: No seriously, these “synthetic shares” are real, and are being sold back and forth on the market place!**

Do you know what you get when you Google “synthetic shares”? A bunch of [Indian biomed companies](https://postimg.cc/FYc2syMD) with “synthetic” in their company name. Do you know what happens when you control for these Indian biomed companies?  You get results that are [basically nothing](https://postimg.cc/xcBw2x4X). If “synthetic shares” were a real phenomenon, you wouldn’t have to go digging through this many foreign small-cap biomed companies to find any information about it. And before anyone chimes in, snthetic call options and put options *are* real, but those are **very** different from what OP is claiming.

**Claim #4: Hedge funds are totally getting squeezed by GME’s rise!**

People who make this claim often resort to proving it by:

* using complex calculations

* depend on incomplete data

* make suppositions

* discard any data that disproves their claims

[Source — 600 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/)

However, we don’t need to do any logical loop-de-loops to prove that GMe doesn’t have an exceptionally high level of short interest. In fact, all we have to do is go to [an old fan favorite of WSB](https://isthesqueezesquoze.com/) to see the true story laid out for us in a very clear, concise argument.

Here, we have a few important metrics:

*Short interest — 16% — the amount of shares short as a percentage of the float — while 16% is atypically high, it’s nowhere *near* the purported 100-350% [some suspicious people](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/) with one-month old accounts are shilling.

* Borrow rate — 0.6% — particularly low. Borrow rates — that is, the rate people are paid to lend out the stock on a yearly basis — go up a lot the more a stock is shorted. For reference, RKT was at 20% a few weeks ago.

* Borrow availability — 300,000 shares — the most heavily shorted stocks often appear as “no shares available for shorting” for a long time — *days, even* — since their shares are so in demand to borrow and sell short.

So there you have it. Three very simple, easy metrics you can use to verify that the stock is not as heavily shorted as some people want you to believe. To believe otherwise would mean you would have to buy in to conspiracies about a wide-ranging collaboration between various market participants and entities with differing aims, ethics, and stakes, involving thousands of people, and all to cover up the true short rate of just *one* stock. [Occam’s Razor, y’all](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

**Conclusion**

Now you have to ask yourself — do you like the *stock* or do you like the *hype*? Because if it’s the former, then you should not be supporting the people continually spreading disinformation about it. If it’s the latter, then have fun on this wild ride, but don’t lie or support lying to your fellow WSBers. It’s immoral,  and it;s not cute when somekne points out these lies and incosistencies and all you can say is “tl;dr, buying more”.",45,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7l0p0/gme_disinfo_exposed_1_why_the_gme_moass_post_that/,wallstreetbets

As some of you may know, the powers that be have been on a self-righteous moral crusade around the world. Ireland is putting warning labels on beer. In Australia it is illegal for adults to buy vaping products, Canada has sugar sweetened beverage tax.. you get my drift. Adults are not allowed to do adult stuff, and mark my words if history is anything to look at, next stop is undoubtedly prohibition.

Now I'm not here to argue what people should and shouldn't be allowed to do, I'm here to give the most important DD you'll hear in your lifetime, and I'll keep it so simple a bag holding meme stonk ape would understand. So now that we're on the topic of history, when did the prohibition of alcohol come into play? **January 17, 1920**. If you are not aware throughout the 1920's a long boom took stock prices to peaks never before seen. Why? Because they made everything fun **ILLEGAL.**

People need an outlet as we're all just animals in the end of the day, the same way a lemur sucks on a poison millipede for a high and a dolphin passes the blowfish bong around to its flipper buddies **WE NEED AN ESCAPE TOO**. People were so bored that the only thing they could do is fucking gamble on horse and cart stocks, it's actually illegal to make the stock market illegal in capitalism, look it up. So everyone went balls deep on fd's 20's style and shit only went up.

It was only a full 9 years later when they had the biggest stock market crash ever seen. The great depression of **1929**. With the last remaining outlet for degeneracy gone; the stock market, people turned to crime, and like clockwork they began to unwind the laws that made this mess in the first place. Prohibition ended December 5, 1933.

Before you autists get all frothy at me, I'm not telling anyone to give up their 💎🙌. The beauty of stocks is that you can own more than one.

AMC opened today at 4x the price, after trending up for days. It bounced around half its ATH of $35, before closing at 300% gain for the day.

GME hit $380 today, up six times its all time high of $63. The current GME price scares away non-autist retail investors, and at that price, new buyers will be expending multiples more capital for the same upward pressure.

If you don't believe me, look at the numbers. As GME is hitting mainstream and is the big hotness on this sub, AMC also outperformed GME by 165% by close today.

Also, #saveAMC is already trending as it gains traction across social media. People are actively looking for a new GME they feel they missed the boat on.

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-shares-outerspace

https://twitter.com/reddittrading/status/1354479260363354117

Despite how low the price already was, it has a record number of shorts: over 38 million. This means another short squeeze isn't just on the menu - it's already starting. It's the third most shorted stock out there, despite its clearly viable future. This doesn't distract from GME's slaughter of hedge funds because it's the next wave of their an hero.

AMC has raised a billion dollars to weather out coronavirus, amid an ongoing ""Safe & Clean"" push. Some studios like WB are moving to parallel releases on HBO Max, but AMC is already throwing out deals to get people in the door. Meanwhile, Hollywood has been sitting on blockbusters after watching Tenet and WW1984 eat shit on streaming:

https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean

Their debt/equity ratio has also been trending positively, even as coronavirus has intensified. Just a return to the mean suggests ridiculous gain, even ignoring the likelihood of pent-up demand. AMC has legs not just for the next week, but for the next few quarters.

https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMC/amc-entertainment-holdings/debt-equity-ratio

Coronavirus, the main cause for AMC's big downturn, is on the way out as vaccines will be available to all by spring, just ahead of summer blockbuster season.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-biden-anyone-spring/

In the long term, after hedge fund shorters lose their ass on GME, brick and mortar game stores will have less of a future, with or without coronavirus. It's easier to digitally download games, and hardware can be bought online and received the next day from any number of retailers. There's no way to mount a 20 foot screen in your house. Unless, of course, you buy AMC stock now.

It's been averaging down ever since, until … November 2020. Anyone want to guess what happened? That's right, Biden was elected President.

(Crude Oil Prices 70-Year Historical Chart)

This Graph represents the price of oil. Notice how oil is significantly less then it was in 2008, but yet gas is at an all time high at $5.80 (National Average) why is that? You understand why the argument of ""high gas prices is purely a result of of high oil prices"" would be false, right?

The other argument we hear often is ""Big Oil Companies Are Being Greedy"". Let me show you why that's not the case.

Most of us understand business operate under margins, if they have added costs guess what … They're not paying it, you are. You've probably heard of a term called "" Demand Pull"" but have you heard of the term "" Cost Push""?

(A Timeline of Biden's Actions on Oil And Gas)

**January 20, 2021** : Biden’s first actions was to revoke approval for the Keystone XL, and impose a moratorium on oil and gas leasing federal lands and waters . Roughly 25% of U.S. production comes from federal areas.

Regulation & you've just eliminated 25% of the U.S supply. Does anyone know how supply and demand works? Did he stop there? Of course not!

**February 26, 2021:** Biden updates the ""social cost of greenhouse gas emissions,"" dramatically altering the way the U.S. government calculates the real-world costs of climate change. The administration plans boost the figure it will use to assess greenhouse gas pollution's damage inflicts on society to $51 per ton of carbon dioxide (**Seven times higher**) . This would apply to any new oil and gas lease sale, raising producers’ costs to deliver new supplies.

Another Tax expense on something that can't even be measured  
accurately, $51 per ton (7X Higher) who pays for it? You! Cost push, you thin I'm done? I've only started.

**June 1, 2021:** Eliminating a slew of tax benefits for oil, gas and coal producers. Eliminating these tax provisions imperils U.S. energy security by raising costs for domestic producers and would increase America’s reliance on foreign energy supplies.

Ohh so you removed tax benefits issued by the previous administration, sounds like an added cost. Who pays? You!

**August 11, 2021:** Biden calls on OPEC+ producers to increase supply to help curb rising oil prices, even though the U.S. is one of the three largest producers in the world and can deliver supply with a lower carbon footprint

We're the top producer of oil in the entire world, yet we've become dependent on countries like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia . Not only can we supply ourselves with oil but we could do it with less carbon foot print then the rest of the world.

( The Biden administration has set new requirements that increase the amount of ethanol that must be blended into the nation’s gasoline supply.)

If all this wasn't bad enough now we have people who produce nothing (Politicians) telling the private sector how to produce oil. They want to increase the use of ethanol in gas.

I'll make the argument on why ethanol is a horrible idea in bullet points.

* 95% of ethanol is produced from corn , we have a major corn shortage. This will worsen the already bad food supply.
* Expect increase use in fertilizer also experiencing a major shortage .
* Ethanol can be extremely damaging to engines and high-powered sports equipment, leading to corrosion of the engine and fuel system.

(Biden warns Big Oil over gas output)

""President Biden will warn CEOs of the nation's largest oil companies on Wednesday that he's considering invoking emergency powers ""

""Prepared to use all reasonable and appropriate Federal Government tools and emergency authorities to increase refinery capacity and output in the near term.""

This scared me completely because it sounds like his administration would like to nationalize the oil industry, and we've seen what happened to Venezuela.

uqlki1,2022-05-16 02:28:01,Avoid any stock with China influence or roots. Also prepare for a bear market for a while.,"Sup boys, been taking a break waiting on the crash since Trump miracled 7 trillion into the market.

I thought when Biden got in it would collapse but it looks like it took 2 years.

I dont think we're done though.  Heres why.

China imminent collapse.

War in Russia.  Nato escalations. 

World wide shortages. 

 Cryptocurreny collapse.

Let me start with 🇨🇳 

Chinas economy has run rampant for the last 20 years.  The United States borrows trillions from China.  However, China is in a deeper bubble than we have ever seen.  

Chinas main source of economy is in real estate.   Do you know there are abaondoned sky scrapers in China right now?  Its like detroit had a baby with dubai.  They built a city for 10 million people and cant even get 100,000 to buy the properties. The banks print out real estate loans more than Jpow is printing out singles.

This happened in dubai as well, I'm not sure on current affairs but i remember all the sports cars like Ferrari and Mclarens left abandoned in parking lots and the desert after they defaulted and left country before they got their heads chopped off. (Serious arab law)

Today you can explore abandoned high rises in china, some half constructed abandoned.

In 2021 Q4 484 chinese businesses defaulted on their major real estate payments. (This should be double digits)

On top of all of this, covid has run absolutely rampant to the point they are locking people in 🍎 factories and can't leave.  This may be what pops the bubble but I would not put a nickel of my burger king check into any China owned companies. Have you all tried to buy a car lately?  You cant.  China and all of the nafta companies aren't producing near enough goods.  If you can't sell you cant make tendies.

If and when the bubble burst it will shake up an already rattled global economy with the 🇺🇦 war.   I think this year possibly next the united states will enter into the war. 

Already ships like the USS Kearsarge are in route to the Baltic Sea arrived 24hours ago

I would guess a 5-10 trillion dollar loss on NASDAQ overnight is possible could be this year if announce of the war, I'm sure it will start with a russian attack that hits american troops, a plane or an embassy.  The moment this happens (it will) you need to start shorting before the boomers pull out of their 401k.  

If you already havent pulled out of your 401k consider it, transfer it to a roth ira or something like S&P500 on td ameriteade thats setup for retirement where you can pull out quickly. 

On top of that the ticking time bomb of China we got a goold old great depression cooking.  

Anyways boys

l9gwx2,2021-01-31 17:22:24,"I know that we LOVE $AMC and $GME, but why can't we HATE a stock. I might have an AMAZING short opportunity.","FULL DISCLAIMER

I am a fucking retard so my math is probably wrong, but if its not it proves that $DB is MASSIVELY overvalued and presents an enormous short opportunity for retail investors like ourselves. Also, it just happens to screw over one of the most evil and corrupt banks in the United States, if not the world. (They also have more than 300B in Debt)

Overshadowed by the recent infinite money glitch known as $GME and $AMC, $DB experienced THREE gigantic scandals in one week.

1. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-regulators-press-deutsche-bank-090221050.html?.tsrc=rss](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-regulators-press-deutsche-bank-090221050.html?.tsrc=rss)

Now that we are aware of the fraudulent and scammy work conducted by these assholes, lets analyze their share price.

**Current Share Price:** 10.12

**Historical (12 Month) Earnings Per Share:** \-0.89 (0.1 Q3 2020)

**Annual Sales:** 28.9B

**Annual Dividend per Share:** 0.10

**Historical Price/Earnings (Median):** 16.70

**Book Value Per Share:** 0.2939

([https://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-companys-stock-price-21802.html](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-companys-stock-price-21802.html))

I used two of the formulas presented in the above article Benjamin Graham & P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

1. Projected Price using Benjamin Graham Formula

1a. SQR ((15)(1.5)(.1)(0.2939)) = 0.81 (actual value per share)

2. P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

2a. ((16.70)(0.1)) = 1.67 (intrinsic value)

&#x200B;

This means the actual *value* of the stock is *Drumroll Please...*

Between  $0.81 - $1.67

&#x200B;

If my math is correct (and it probably isn't), then this means that Deutsche Bank's stock is MASSIVELY overvalued and is due for a market correction (hence the AMAZING shorting opportunity). Also, if I am wrong please correct me - I only would like to learn more about the market, so I can eventually lose $5,000,000 in an earnings call.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Current Price = 10.12

&#x200B;

I do not want to mess up the momentum of $GME or $AMC, I am only posting this because in the same way that we LIKE those stocks, I think we should also be open to DISLIKING some of the worst stocks on the market. Especially stocks with ties to CNBC and the other hedge fund assholes who have enslaved us with debt.

&#x200B;

178sdll,2023-10-15 23:39:37,Snapchat (SNAP) Undervalued?,"Snapchat has fallen significantly from its ATH of $83 in Sept 2021 to $8.7 in Oct 2023 without any significant bounce.  
I believe the stock is unfairly valued, especially for the long term. Let's look at why.

  
The Good.  
\- If you are a Snapchat user you know how sticky the platform can be. A lot of your memories, clips, and key moments are stored directly on Snapchats servers. This greatly reduces the chances of people switching the app altogether. Another observation of this that I've increasingly noticed around me is that people open the Snapchat app by default as a camera. This along with its streak concept, keeps people hooked and unwilling to get rid of the app especially if they have a group of friends on them too. And new users every year will only create a snowball effect.

\- Instagram, Snaps biggest competitor has slowly evolved into a very commercial product where people mindlessly scroll through random content. The edge that Snapchat has here is that it has a far more personal experience among its users. 

\- Continuous innovation is also another huge plus in my book as they are very quick to adapt and introduce new features in their platform, such as the AI bot, which it adapted very quickly upon chatgpts release. Plus they have been working on VR and AR for a long time, and are very good at it too. Hence we can comfortably say they are continuously innovating and the future could be very bright for them.

\- The price for Snapchat if you believe in it long term is very attractive at these prices. These low prices have not been seen since Feb of 2019. And the platform has significantly matured since then. 

\- Increasing revenue.

\- Great risk to reward ratio for long term investors, and for short term investors a swing trade to $25 is likely. 

The Bad.  
\- They haven't been making a profit and having a hard time monetizing their platform. But I think this problem will sooner or later be resolved.

\- There may still be room for the stock to fall. Even though the price looks like it has found a floor, the ATL is still -40% away from the current price.

That's about it. I hope I could shed some light on SNAP and why I'm betting on their future success.",1,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/178sdll/snapchat_snap_undervalued/,wallstreetbets
l98q6y,2021-01-31 09:07:49,Citadel bought GME?!?!,"So as everyone knows, the Hedge Fund with the biggest short position on GME is Melvin Capital.  As we also know, Melvin got an emergency cash infusion of $2.75 billion last Monday from Citadel and Point72 to help them with their GME shorts. 

On a post the other day someone sent the following helpful [link with positions hedge funds have](https://hedgefollow.com/stocks/GME).  Did a search for GME and at the bottom of the Top 20 hedge funds that own GME is Citadel With 111.8k shares which is only .01% of their portfolio.  It says their position is new but believe this list is as of Q4 2020.  This is confusing me as this position contradicts their support of Melvin which may be going bankrupt if we have our way.  Unless they are holding to hedge the support of Citadel?   Any thoughts on this?  I want to see both Melvin and Citadel go bankrupt and hate to see one of them profit off GME mooning.

Does anyone have an updated list of hedge fund positions or a list of what stocks hedge funds are shorting?

TLDR, Why does Citadel have a long position in GME?  I don’t want to see them make a dime off of GME mooning.

What I found is actually super interesting, to me anyways. But dont forget, past performance does not equal future performance and this is all just speculative, but then again banks and people do have patterns, so if it is as highly manipulated as they say it is, maybe this is something. Anyways heres my retard document I spent far too long on.

https://imgur.com/gallery/gA6gbZP

So bassically we have a batman pattern in 2008 and were curently on the right ear of a batman patern right now. Whats interesting is the VW infinity squeeze happened in October 08, just to the right of batmans ear. We are currently in the middle of a GME infinity squeeze, and are currently, on batmans right ear. The difference is what side of batman the crashes are, in 2008 the crash is to the right of batman, in 2020 the crash is to the left of batman. So that kills the pattern right? Wrong, in 2008 The fed didnt start the quantiative easing until 3 months after lehman brothers went bankrupt and the worst that could happen, happenned. In 2020 the fed Started QE as soon as possible, thus the reversed sides of batman make complete sense.

With all this said, this could mean that SLV will finish it's batman ear and the gme squeeze will crash SLV and then a recovery to ATH, it could mean that because of the reversed crash patterns SLV will start climbing to ATH without finishing batmans ear, or, the most likely scenario, this means absolutely nothing and I just wasted a couple hours of my weekend.

EDIT: I think I should clear this up, I'm not advocating to dump gme and buy slv. SLV wont start rising to ATH until after the GME infinity squeeze. We need it to happen

**Stock is not down 80 % yet so this shit is gonna come down hard soon (I give it a month max NFA). Easy short, puts into and after ex dividend date = free money (???). Bulls r insanely fk.**

Positions: 12 puts in range 19-22 for september monthly expiry initially. Will scale into more degen bets in the coming weeks. I am not early, but others are seemingly stupid giving us the chance to grab puts on the cheap after news which should have tanked the stock price

POST BEGIN: 

As most of us know AMC had earnings on thursday after hours. It was a sought after earnings as AA had been hinting to something big happening, a “pounce” some might say. What this proved to be was a Preferred stock dividend with the ticker $APE (lol). Most people were let down by this, some were excited, but if you look under the hood it is insane how the AMC stock price as of today ended the day up over 18 % and you might think how the fuck did that happen? Earnings sucked balls!  AMC had a shitton of [FTDs due](https://stocksera.pythonanywhere.com/ticker/failure_to_deliver/?quote=AMC) this week as can be seen below, but thats not important.

&#x200B;

[AMC Failure to delivers due last week](https://preview.redd.it/mxehqxv44ag91.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1bcb882183c29e836484ba4db7642f1de9364af)

Last year AMC sought shareholder approval for an issuance of an additional 25 million shares to raise cash, but shareholders dissapproved of this as the apes had gotten tired of getting diluted. With AMCs current cash burn rate and their deferred rent payments at the time they did not have a lot of runway left before an inevitable bankruptcy unless they drastically improved their business. The most recent quarter AMC posted a loss to the tune of 121.6 million $, no share dilution approved still, but in comes AA with “the pounce”.

&#x200B;

What this pounce actually turned out to be was a big middle finger to all the investors who disapproved of their requested 25 million share dilution last year. He did not only find a way to get this dilution without shareholder approval. He did not double down, not quadruple down but 100x double down by issuing a new stock which have the exact same voting rights as AMC common stock on the conversion from APE to AMC (lol).

This new ticker which we all know as $APE will give AA and the C-suite the ability to dilute it up to 4.5 billion shares after it has started trading on the NYSE. AA says black on white this was his plan B if investors didnt approve of a dilution (He always finds a way to dilute ;) )

&#x200B;

He is also no stranger to dilution. Through the late parts of 2021 and first half of 2021 he diluted like his life depended on it as we see in the image below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9wynx9sd4ag91.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3b7471f7e02b022634b519182b862a4e2e456a1

Some might say “but the APE dilution doesn’t matter as AMC wont be diluted so my shares should retain their value”. This is wrong because the $APE shares have literally all the properties AMC have when it comes to the vote for conversion. The ""vote for conversion"" if passed would make it so that one share of APE will be convertable into 1 common share of AMC. And if that vote passes 1 share of ape is identical to 1 share of AMC. You control majority vote through either APE or AMC you control the company. Its literally the same stock, but a different ticker.

&#x200B;

In the relevant SEC filing on page 2 we find the following: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2cz2w0fj4ag91.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=a74fc0cded085ec7ac68a708ad3544b83e5e95a8

From the same document we have black on white that they can dilute the APE token without seeking any shareholder approval

 So both preferred stock units and common shares get the same voting power and can vote on the common stock amendment. AA can dilute the preferred stock by up to 4.5 billion shares. Assuming retail owns the entire float of AMC (this is not true) that means they will have to buy up after full dilution a minimum of 1.739 billion APE tokens from all dilutions to exclude any chance of being outvoted by any others on the conversion vote from $APE to $AMC common stock. Retail simply does not have that capital, and to be frank they do not own the float on AMC. Last shareholders meeting had a total of 268,775,910 voters as can be seen in the relevant SEC filing.

 What’s even more funny is now during the weekend Adam Aron himself is admitting its a dilution on twitter and is floundering around trying to “calm” his investors stating this is \*\*Good diluton\*\* and not bad dilution.

lu5o0u,2021-02-28 04:15:33,How you're ACTUALLY getting fucked,"Judging from the average post and comment on here, most of you correctly suspect that the financial service industry and financial regulations have generally fucked you over, but you then seem to think that every possible way you might get fucked, no matter how far fetched, is actually true.

I'm here to tell you that a broker doesn't try to trade against you when you execute a trade, the Fed doesn't directly lend money to hedge funds to short, short ladder attacks don't exist, that naked shorting is not happening, and hedge funds generally underperform the market so they're just as stupid as anyone else.

1. Brokers find counterparties to trade with through market makers. They do not want to take the risk of being a counterparty to your trade, because they have no idea whether you are informed are not. They earn money through fees and in the case of RH, by selling order flow and by having poorer execution than most brokers.
2. The Fed lends money to banks through the discount window. Yes, it is true that the most recent quantitative easing has benefited asset prices but not the economy, so it's been a bust from a social welfare standpoint and has basically been a net transfer of wealth from people who are newly saving to the already wealthy. (The first QE in 2008 and 2009 may have been necessary, but that's a more complex story.)
3. Short ladder attacks just don't exist. I don't know what else to say about this one.
4. Shorting goes above 100% of shares outstanding in the following way: a share is lent to be shorted and sold short and the investor who buys that shorted share lends it out again to be shorted. In theory this could go on arbitrarily high. It's fine to want a regulation that limits the amount of shorting as a percentage of shares outstanding. I think this is sensible and would mitigate volatility but there's no naked shorting going on.
5. [Hedge funds have been underperforming](https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/study-sheds-light-on-why-hedge-funds-are-struggling/) by 0.8% per annum on a risk-adjusted basis since 2009.

How are you actually being screwed?

1. While there is not direct regulatory capture of the Federal Reserve, numerous economists that work for the Reserve have thoughts of potentially getting high paying Wall Street jobs. They almost never want to write a paper that just shits all over banks. This and the fact that they speak to banks but do not speak to us directly means that their policies lean towards helping banks. This is isn't some weird backroom moustache twirling bullshit that seems to be pushed around. Unfortunately, it's a bit worse, since it's an endemic cultural problem with incentives that are hard to untangle.
2. High frequency trading firms / market makers like Citadel, Jane Street, and Renaissance Medallion Fund earn their alpha in the most volatile periods for two reasons: they earn wide bid-ask spreads and the market is highly predictable on a short term basis during those periods, so they're effectively front-running the herd that is leaving or entering a position.
3. Less of a problem in WSB, but mutual fund companies launch tons of funds and only market the ones that do well obviously. They rely on survivorship bias and luck to drive assets. They make different bets in different funds and they'll certainly have a winner somewhere.
4. Brokers try to convince you that you can beat the market. The average retail investor does not beat the market. They are the counterparty to the institutional investor who does beat the market.

How do you avoid being screwed? However boring it is, if you buy and hold a global stock ETF, no one can ever fuck with you. It barely trades.

Everyone SEEMS to be super self-aware of their own intellectual shortcomings (let's call it) but ironically, people then state utter nonsense with supreme confidence and everyone pats them on the back for being correct and ""in the know."" (""This guy still thinks that there are two political parties in the United States. Don't you know the parties are owned by the same corporate interests?"" Wow. So insightful and edgy, even though the two parties agree on almost nothing.) It's not that hard to nab a job of some sort at a large asset manager, and the pay isn't bad either. See how it actually is. It's far more mundane and when there's evil, it's banal evil--shutting down the underperforming fund and only mentioning the outperforming ones to prospective clients or trying to explain away bad performance in overly technical terms hoping that your clients think you're smart and don't fire you.

The industry needs to change desperately. It sucks away talent to do useless bullshit. It often acts as a net transfer of wealth from investor to asset manager. But it's not what you guys think it is at all.

We know the media, the banks, the platforms, and the hedge funds have been trying to scare us to bail on GME. It’s not so inconceivable that they’re trying to do the opposite, too: titillate us into thinking that the price will go higher and higher and higher. 

I may have autism but I’m not retarded. Do you really think seeing GME at $1,000 will inevitably mean it will go to $2,000 or $5,000 or $6,900? Who controls the game? Hint: IT IS NOT YOU.

I’m just begging you all to take SOME profit when we hit $1,000, but don’t sit there getting greedy thinking “well if it hit $1,000 it can hit $2,000 which means I can afford TWO orders of tendies!” Some of the numbers I see here are absurd. $30,000 — for real? Citadel and all those fucks probably went long yesterday, or are otherwise trying to figure out how to. As soon as this bitch gets them comfortably in the black they will bail. Meanwhile they hope a handful of retail clutches on the rocket to the sun, forgetting that mother fucking Icarus died trying to get there.

12k2y3g,2023-04-12 23:02:39,Get Fucked Bulls,"Hold the line bears! Bulls are out of steam, and this is where all the gains come from as a gay bear. When the bulls are at max confidence and the rug gets pulled.

Let’s review…

Remember the SPCE news when the flew their shit flight? Rumor was bought, news was sold.

Remember when Elon went on SNL and pumped Doge? Rumor was bought, news was sold.

Remember October lows: we all knew it was going to be hot CPI. It can’t get worse than this. Rumor was sold, bad news was bought.

Remember earlier this week, and last week, when people expected inflation to cool going into this CPI print? Rumor was bought, news was sold. 

Remember how the bulls say it’s “priced in” and they are pricing in a fed pivot? The rumor of cooler inflation, the reason for a pivot, was realized today, we sold off. Why? Why did rate expectations go up?

Remember that energy deflation was the number one driver of overall disinflation? Remember how there wasn’t any rumor for OPEC cut? It surprised everyone and oil was bought immediately. Remember how energy prices underpin all economic activity - and that Biden already blew the SPR?

Remember how the bulls just put together an epic 2 quarter rally from October to today, with rising rates, collapsing banks, and a shit economic outlook? Remember how they bought the dip, deployed their bonuses, deployed their tax returns and are all sitting on unrealized gains?

Remember now that capital was deployed, and is still deployed, on the rumor of a fed pivot and a soft landing? On the rumor of “this time it’s different”? Remember how people are using 0DTE or margin to go all in on FRC shares?

Remember how retail always moves last and the wealth transfer only works when retail deployed leveraged capital at the top - only to be liquidated on the way down - so smart money can deploy leverage capital at the bottom. 

Remember that Powell has delivered on his dot plot, and on expectations, at every meeting. Remember that “no one sees rate cuts for the rest of the year” is what the man said.

Remember money supply is tightening and banks are essentially all zombies at this point. All of them owe their existence to the feds special facility - they do what the fed wants - the fed wants inflation down unemployment up.

Remember that unemployment might be hard to move, a lot of dead old people, no real immigration, no cheap labor. Remember pow doesn’t control unemployment, just the cost of money - so how much HIGHER does the dial need to go until we see 4 percent unemployment?

Remember the money supply has never slowed this fast, to this degree, and remember US runs on credit. No credit? No growth, no more EPS no more multiple expansion.

Remember, policy acts with a lag - nothing has happened yet in the real economy besides some minimal layoffs, SPACs died, and SVB died. A blip on the radar - the impact has been meaningless thus far.

Remember, the smartest of retail will take their gains. Bearish. The dumbest of retail will buy the dip again, with leverage, just loading up positions on the wrong side of the boat. This makes the liquidation on the way down even more violent. Bearish.


Remember that stocks need a reason to go up: buyers > sellers. Remember that bulls need to manufacture that reason (money, greed, innovation, cheap capital, no alternative). Is there more ammo left? Are the call buyers and leveraged longs going to reload tomorrow? Or are they feeling a little unsure now that they got exactly what they wanted?

Fear and greed drive the market.

It’s obvious what was driving the past 6 months of price action: greed.

Are we all still feeling greedy… or maybe… we are afraid of losing those gains?

m6u2km,2021-03-17 06:33:23,Why UWMC is no match for RKT in the long term,"First, I'm not talking about any squeeze potential, which can happen to either/both stocks. I'm interested in the business models of these companies.

**Intro**

I think many people are familiar with the RKT/UWMC feud after the RKT squeeze put both in the spot light. UWMC issued an ultimatum to mortgage brokers to stop working with other companies, which supposedly 90% of their existing broker partners agreed to. Many people here and on other subreddits are invested, and claiming each of these companies are significantly undervalued. I just want to put things into perspective from the business model side and future outlook side. 

**Business Model - direct lending and broker lending**

First, let's talk about their business models. RKT is fairly diversified a number of lending businesses, with their TPO division for brokers but majority of their mortgage lending business direct to consumer. On the other hand, UWMC only deal with mortgage brokers, who make their cut between the lender and consumer. 

In general, consumers with good credit and who has long standing existing banking relations with a bank or credit union will go there first. They may compare a few lenders to get the best rate, but generally working with lenders directly, especially if they know someone in the business. Only when you have a special circumstance on your credit history/rating or when you can't get a satisfactory loan directly from your local lenders, then your realtor may suggest going to a broker. Brokers make money because they may be able to get you a loan that otherwise you may not (or shouldn't) qualify for. This actually contributed a lot to the mortgage default crisis in 08. 

When I bought my first house I had a special circumstance for my loan application and couldn't get the loan size that I wanted with lenders, and my realtor suggested we can go find brokers who can find high interest rate loans of that size, some of them even from private lenders. Luckily we were able to find a credit union that could work with us. But you get the gist - mortgage brokers sometimes work with (and sometimes prey on) people with low credit who can't loans directly from lenders, and this is what they get paid for. Not all brokers are bad, but there is definitely a ""car salesman"" feeling from them. In the end, I would think the loans that brokers push through are in general more risky than direct to consumer loans. I don't work in the business but people who do could find some statistics. When rates starts to rise, and also after the mortgage moratorium end, the first to default will be these higher interest rate loans from brokers. I think RKT is positioned better than UWMC in a higher interest rate environment.

**Innovation and growth**

This will go hand in hand with the valuation section below. Brokers, no matter what they are brokering, are a thing of the past. With information and technology, the trend is definitely for individuals to browse and pick on their own. This is not to say everything should be automated. Especially for a big purchase like a house, professional help is needed and this is why realtors still have a job even with the rise of Zillow and Redfin etc. But professional help is really only need for getting legal things done and for things that requires tacit skills like negotiating prices on an offer. Mortgage requirements are for the most part set in stone and rates are mostly non-negotiable. So what is the job of the broker? They just aggregate information for you, which technology is poised to do just as well, if not better. Technology also brings transparency so everyone's competing on a level field; you don't need to ""know a guy"" to get your loan at the best rates for your situation. This kind of no frills experience is the new way of doing business and led to the rise of Zillow, Carmax, lemonade, etc. RKT is trying to do that and this is what will transform the mortgage industry, not someone like UWMC, who is just trying to squeeze both the brokers and consumers to get more profits in the short term and stay alive.

**valuation** 

A lot of people are talking of each companies valuations relative to many metrics like sales and earnings. You cannot compare these ratios to the tech and meme growth stocks that we are all so familiar with. Just go to finviz and put in P/S under 4 and see how many companies show up. If a company doesn't have high margins and/or potential for exponential growth, they will not and should not carry a huge P/S ratio. For UWMC, I don't see any way this company can grow very fast or innovate, especially given their hostile attitude towards their own broker partners. For RKT it's harder to say whether their technologies like the mostly automatic underwriting process, and also their attempt to have good UI and customer service, is enough to be deserving of a high valuation. But at least I do see them transforming the traditional mortgage business and I think they stand a high chance of maintaining their rapid growth as more tech-savvy people start to purchase homes.

**Summary**

Don't just buy into UWMC because they spiked later than RKT and they ""seem like an undervalued"" stock. A quick look at the different approaches of these two companies clearly reveals who is the innovative ""sleeping giant"" and who is the boomer stock. While both may be good speculative short term plays, if you are serious long term investor I would take a long and hard at these companies.

Prior to the first GME run. There was not a single DD on AMC apart from the rumor it might get buy out by Amazon which never happened. FUCKING NONE.

You need to wake the fuck up and look at both side of the stories. 

1.Wanda group is the largest stakeholder of AMC. All companies in China basically make money for the Communist party. Yes I fucking know it has its advantages but it will NEVER benefit you. 

As soon as AMC got included in the meme stocks and got a boost, they selling their shares at double digits leaving you holding the bag. Did GME do that?

2. Fundamentals. Did you guys know about rating agencies?

THEY BASICALLY DO DD FOR YOU EVERY 6MONTHS AND TELL YOU HOW DANGEROUS AN INVESTMENT CAN BE.

AMC credit rating is at CC,FUCKING DOUBLE C not even CCC. It's so trash it has to sell 200m shares at $2.8 in December to pay off their debt,  now you all want in at fucking $8? Meanwhile GME got upgraded to B3(B-) during the fucking pandemic.

10ldjx7,2023-01-25 23:44:58,"$TSLA is not a buy, it's a HOLD at best and a SELL imo. Here is why.","We got the Tesla earnings and Papa Elon cult is back at it with their ""bers r fuk"" posts. 


I know we're all regarded here but just try looking into TSLA's actual Q4 earnings package. 


Firstly it tells you everything you need to know about Tesla the company. It's all about marketing. That's the only thing Elon is good at... well mostly. 


Numbers that matter are at the very end of the report after 8 pages of photos for you crayon eating monkeys. 


TESLA IS AN AUTO MANUFACTURER! Even in their comparison charts that's what they compare themselves to. But what they don't compare is apples to apples. Automotive gross margin of Tesla is on a decline after a year where they had the highest prices before they had to cut prices at the end of 22 and beginning of this year. 


With lower prices, their margin is going to drop even more. Now add a slowdown in economy to the mix where they will have lower demand, Tesla has probably just posted their best earnings for the next 4-6 quarters. 


This is probably peak Tesla in this cycle. Now let's look at their cashflows. Tesla claims to have enough cash to get through the hard times. This quarter alone, they have used up 15% of their cash from end of Q3. 


Tesla also has an increase in inventory which is not huge but not a great sign. If everything is going so great, we need to see the opposite. 


TL:DR This is a warning post for those of you who think Tesla has dropped ""enough."" When you compare it with other auto manufacturers you see the disconnect. Sooner or later TSLA will be valued just like other auto manufacturers. With limited growth while burning through cash, TSLA is a hold at best and a sell IMO.",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10ldjx7/tsla_is_not_a_buy_its_a_hold_at_best_and_a_sell/,wallstreetbets

1cw9mkc,2024-05-20 07:19:48,"The death of the Iranian president was just confirmed, here's how you could benefit from it.","The death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi introduces significant challenges, given his administration's stringent policies, aggressive foreign stance, and ongoing economic sanctions. This event could worsen internal power struggles and social unrest, similar to past protests. Additionally, Iran's relations with the West, particularly concerning the nuclear deal (JCPOA), might become more strained, potentially stalling sanctions relief and impacting the fragile economy.

Market Implications:

Energy Sector

Iran is a major player in the global oil market. Any instability within the country could lead to concerns about oil supply disruptions, which typically result in increased oil prices. Companies like ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) could see significant movement as oil prices respond to the news. Additionally, WTI Crude Oil futures might experience heightened volatility.

Defense and Security Stocks

Geopolitical uncertainty often leads to increased defense spending, particularly in regions close to the epicenter of the instability. Companies such as Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) could benefit from this increased demand. These firms provide advanced military technology and defense systems that are likely to see higher orders from both the U.S. and its allies in the Middle East.

Middle Eastern Markets

Regional markets, especially in countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, could experience increased volatility. The Tadawul (Saudi Stock Exchange) and the Dubai Financial Market might see fluctuating investor sentiment. ETFs that track these markets, such as the iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF (KSA), could be impacted by changes in regional stability and investor risk appetite.

Safe-Haven Assets

In times of geopolitical uncertainty, investors often flock to safe-haven assets. Gold, represented by SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), and U.S. government bonds are typical beneficiaries. Increased demand for these assets can drive up their prices, providing a hedge against the broader market volatility.",0,0.46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cw9mkc/the_death_of_the_iranian_president_was_just/,wallstreetbets
la74lm,2021-02-01 16:26:53,I think that the Silver hate is actually what they are looking for. Here me out before you nuke me.,"Preface: BUY GME DONT SELL HOLD AND FUCK CITADEL.

I am not preaching for people to buy into paper silver stocks. The criticism that the market is too big to be influenced is correct. There are way more paper silver shares in circulation than there is physical silver to back it up.   


I hope you all realize that the Hedgies understand that this sub will have an adverse reaction to anything they do to try and move people off of GME. They understand that promoting silver will get the reaction that it currently is: people saying that silver is a trick and to forget about it. 

Paper silver shares are not the move, obviously, but Silver still has the potential to be the next big move if we approach it correctly. EMPHASIS ON NEXT\* DO NOT SELL GME OR MOVE INTO THIS POSITION UNTIL THIS WAR IS OVER.

If people start buying physical silver and demanding delivery of their paper shares, it will result in devastation for the Hedgies and Big Banks. This is why they are pushing paper shares so hard to get WSBs to call off the dogs on silver all together. Don't underestimate your enemy, they understand what reactions their actions will get.   


Silver can be the bullet that pops the everything bubble, but it needs to be done in a specific way. If the tutes that are trading all these paper shares that represent far more silver than actually physically exists, then demanding delivery will force them to pay any price to get the material. If the retail market is buying up that physical stock before that happens, they are fucked,   


This is still the long play imo, but I have been in this space for many many years. It is a solid investment regardless of what the outcome is in terms of damage to the tutes. It could be the best next move in this war, but we will see. I am long silver, but I am a physical collector. I think the anti silver hype that has gained traction here is exactly what they are after.   


My suggestion is that we just ignore silver all together for now, but don't forget about it when the GME stage finally resolves. That is what they want. Let's win this GME short squeeze before we promote any other moves, but be extra vigilant of any moves they are making through their media cronies. They are learning what their actions result in, and they will use that to manipulate you away from the things they don't want you focusing on. I truly believe this is a fake out, and we are giving them the reaction they desire by killing any and all moves into the PM space.   


Thats just my opinion though. Do as you see fit. GME to Pluto. GG NO RE",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la74lm/i_think_that_the_silver_hate_is_actually_what/,wallstreetbets
o314nl,2021-06-18 21:49:01,Where was the AMC Squeeze?,"After 2 weeks of AMC hype videos filling up my YT recommendation lists, countless online ""analysts"" completely bullish on the impending ""gamma squeeze"" that was all but assured to hit on Friday 6/18.... today passed with not much difference than any other day.

It honestly feels like we're playing poker at a high stakes table with the Hedge Funds with our cards facing up and looking around the room like we're secretly the smartest guy at the table.

Is it time for us to truly snap back into reality and really look at what's going on here?  Let's be honest... the hedge funds have had weeks/months to learn from their GME mistakes.  Any call options that would have been out of the money today was probably already hedged against days/weeks ago.  Even if they let $40 and $50 OTM options expire today, they are probably recuperating their losses in profits elsewhere in their portfolio.  There may never come a situation where the AMC short squeeze will actually happen.  The gamma squeeze??  Well, that's already happened when it spiked from $10 to $72.  If that's not ""to the moon"", I'm not sure what is, especially for a stock that is 70% over-valued atm.

I understand that this is a ""movement"" and that it's ""ape/retailers vs the big funds"" but I'm also seeing alot of people here yolo their entire savings onto a meme stock.  Am I the only one who thinks that we're doing a complete disservice to the amateur investors here who do not really know what they are doing and \*actually\* thinking they are making wise investments?

At the end of the day, there is no reality where the big hedge funds will just sit & watch and roll-over while we squeeze AMC to $100+ and then tuck their tails between their legs and just swallow the losses without any strategic plan.  I think anyone who is still waiting and believing in this will be the ones left holding the bag.  The same people who held at $20 will be holding at $60, will still be holding even at $120 (if that ever comes) and one day, they will be left holding the bag regretting all of the chances they had to cash out for profit along the way.  Do these ""diamond hands"" actually have an exit plan?

As the old saying goes, it's not a loss until you sell.  But the inverse is also true.  It's never a gain if you hold forever either.  Am I missing something here or are we still all convinced that the hedge funds will stare down an oncoming semi-truck and just stand there like a deer in headlights while retailers rob them blind?

schq5a,2022-01-25 16:33:08,Apes ruined WSB as we know it,"Oh boy, here it goes

GME squeeze in its early stages was a fantastic event, plenty of people that were already on WSB entered positions at 5-10-20-40 dollars and rode to the top, exiting and realizing gains. It was a great event that became pretty popular, and unfortunately attracted 8 million other user, who knew fuck all about investing and just wanted to make a quick buck by sticking it to the hedgies. Problem with them was that they came in and acted like they were the next Warren Buffet, and anyone who disagreed with them was a dumb shill or didn’t understand the movement™️

Stock kept dropping further, going all the way down to $40 dollars, before other 8 million users realized that they were too late for an initial squeeze, and decided that the MOASS is yet to come.

What was initially a calculated plan in a company that was trading as it was already bankrupt became a platform of firing the “establishment” and sticking it to the “hedgies”

Conspiracy theories started spreading, goalposts were being moved, and anyone that disagreed was downvotes into oblivion. There were days when every single post on WSB was about GME. 

That’s fine, no harm in that, if it wasn’t for the mob mentality of literally calling anyone a shill. I was trying to make posts urging new traders to take profits, that trading is a 1 vs 1, not a team game, but my posts were either deleted or I was heavily downvoted.

I started learning about trading on WSB, browsing the sub in 2017. Back then I knew absolutely nothing about options, or trading. This sub was actually a great resource for learning from extremely smart people.
I know there is a stigma that everyone on WSB is retarded, however, back then it was actually smart people with six or seven digit portfolios just goofing around and making risky but **calculated** bets. 
Nowadays, it’s really just a competition in who is dumber and who can write the shittiest DD, than say not a financial advice at the end, and if someone challenges them, they’ll just say “ sir this is Wendy’s”, “I’m just a retard”, or “I eat crayons”. 

Thankfully over the past few months the amount of kids who thought they were some trading gurus for buying a tech stock in March 2020 decreased dramatically, apes moved to another sub that is now ripe with conspiracy theories and constant moving of goalposts. 

I just want to highlight one thing, people are tired of apes flooding this sub, this sub was never meant to be a GME circle jerk. But don’t take it from me, take it from ZJZ, a mod who has been with WSB for many years and kept it a sane place. Even he is tired of apes coming here and shilling a brick and mortar store that continues bleeding cash. 

https://i.imgur.com/oWnUhfT.jpg 

I want to be clear, not a single DD written by apes in the past 6 months has been correct, not one has materialized, and not one date they called led to MOASS. Frankly this sub needs more discussion and DD. You might say, dope, so write DD, be the change you want to see, and trust me I do to.

However, many times DD gets downvotes or you get called for being a shill for a stock that has any sort of cult following, be it WISH, AMC, GME, or any other popular stock.",371,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/schq5a/apes_ruined_wsb_as_we_know_it/,wallstreetbets

veqph0,2022-06-17 21:35:01,The Fed is making a big mistake,"The Fed just raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, the largest single rate hike since 1994. It's another step in the Fed's efforts to tackle the fastest inflation in 40 years.

&#x200B;

I understand the urgency of the Fed, but it has entered dangerous territory. If the Fed continues down this path - as it suggests - the economy will fall into recession. Every time the Fed has raised interest rates so fast over the past half century, it has led to a recession.

&#x200B;

Moreover, the rate hikes won't make up for the main reasons for current inflation -- two years of pent-up demand from the pandemic, shortages of goods and services, Putin's war in Ukraine, and large, profitable companies with enough pricing to use inflation as a cover to further The power to push up prices.

&#x200B;

The Fed assumes that price increases are being driven by wage growth — so-called “wage price inflation.” This is not correct. Wages lag behind inflation. A more accurate description of what we're seeing now might be called ""profit price inflation"" -- price increases driven by companies seeking to increase profits. (See chart below, from the Economic Policy Institute.)

&#x200B;

Recessions are especially detrimental to those most vulnerable to downturns—the first to be laid off (and last to be rehired when the economy improves): low-wage workers, disproportionate women and people of color.

luxlbx,2021-03-01 02:28:46,Snack on the Sneakiest Short Squeeze of all time with UTZ🚀🚀🚀,"I know what you’re thinking. A potato chip company, you gotta be kidding me. I also know you’re thinking another fucking short squeeze, but hear me out… There is something VERY strange going on with this stock and I’m here to shed some light on it. 

Well listen here smooth brain because I’m not kidding and I would never fucking touch a company that moves as slowly as this stock unless I thought I could make a shitload of money. 

There is the sneakiest short squeeze of all time going on here and I’m ready to exploit it and apparently somebody else is too. 

So here it is, laid out as simply as I can put for you dumbasses. Somebody (insider, smart-money, whoever) who knows something we don’t know is betting BIG that this stock is hitting 30$ by the March 19th expiration. They have **OVER 600,000$ riding on this call that sits 5$ out of the money**\- it's the absolute definition of unusual options activity and when coupled with the fact the stock rarely has any options volume and it has ZERO upcoming public events something is about to happen and we just don’t know it yet. 

[Unusual Option Activity on 2\/17 for March 30c](https://preview.redd.it/b95j2t6bubk61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=35b88b935343a21aac7fb5f6d57e75ac2dffbc24)

My thoughts are pretty simple- this stock is on its way up to the fucking moon and with contracts this cheap now after a market slump the opportunity to **10X or 15X** your invest is there. Somebody knows something is going on and with UTZ ‘s recent history of buying up other brands On the Border Tortilla Chips (Second leading tortilla chip brand) and Vitner’s (A Chicago based salty snack manufacturer) a merger is most likely on the horizon and undoubtedly sending this stock over 30$. This merger or announcement would send the shorts running and in an attempt to cover they’d find themselves buying back the stock at insane amounts. 

If you made it this far I bet you already are considering it so why waste your time anymore.

**TLDR: Buy March 19th 30C wait for a big random catalyst event and enjoy.**

For a deeper analysis of what I think will happen here it is:

**The most likely scenario: UTZ 32$+ Per Share 500% Return**

Unlike most of the other companies looked at on this forum UTZ actually makes money. It IPO’d via a SPAC merger and has been on a tear up over 150% since then. However, unlike your typical SPAC this company makes good money and has a good balance sheet with plenty of cash on hand. They’ve been using this cash to buy other brands like crazy in hopes of expanding their market out of the mostly the northeast and midwest to the rest of the country. Their CEO Dylan Lissette has made it known on CNBC that he wants to grow the company and has aggressive plans to do so. This would lend that big better to most likely be anticipating a massive merger in the following weeks which would allow them to cash in their huge position at a massive gain. 

**The rare but plausible scenario: UTZ Short Squeeze 50$+ Per Share 5000% Return**

This will sound a little crazy but at this point I know you guys will believe anything if I put enough rockets and tell you I’ll make you rich- which I am. So listen, **THIS WILL MAKE YOU RICH IF IT HAPPENS AND IT'S WORTH BETTING ON**. There is the possibility for a quick short squeeze and a subsequent gamma squeeze the likes of which would send this **WELL** stock beyond 50$. 

Here is some quick math for you:

15.23% of the stock is held by insiders.

71.26% of the stock is held by institutions. 

There are 2.95 MILLION shares SHORTED.

What this all means is that with the current amount of stock held by insiders and institutions there is only 8 millions shares free float. This becomes a big problem for the shorts very quickly if the stock price shoots up on a merger, not only because they are forced to buy back their shares BUT market makers are now involved due to the larger options orders THAT if soon become in the money will FORCE them to buy shares of the underlying stock to remain delta neutral.

As you know market makers try their best to remain delta neutral when making deals. When this big buyer came in and forced market makers to open 5,000 contracts with a delta of 0.25 they were forced to buy 25% of the shares they owed in those 5,000 contracts- to remain delta neutral as I said. 

5,000 contracts = 500,000 outstanding shares (if the contracts are in the money) 

In order to remain delta neutral they would have to purchase 125,000 shares. Which they did as seen here: When the big buy orders hit the tape at 10:11 AM we see a huge spike as market makers buy in as they need to have 125,000 shares purchased to remain delta neutral. 

[MM Big Purchase at 10:11 on 2\/17](https://preview.redd.it/gso9r544vbk61.jpg?width=1177&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2cff362d577d8fe165cfc3728b8bac6b5e7cef50)

As open interest increases and we now see it nearing closer to 7,000 contracts, as the stock moves closer to 30$ more market makers will be forced to buy in and thus leave less room for the shorts to cover their asses. If buying increases and stock is held then these shorts could be on the hook for a lot of money.

We as humans are fascinated by asymmetrical returns, I see articles people ""Yoloing"" their life savings on these worthless stocks. Yes, the share price does rise, but don't just believe a handful of people on this subreddit are responsible for it. There are hedge funds that run quant strategies which buy and sell stocks based on momentum alone and would have possibly made a ton of money on the AMC stock price run-up. So the whole narrative that you are going to stick it to ""Hedge funds"" or ""Wall Street"" is just plain wrong.

Another thing you haven't realised is these increased share prices have only allowed company insiders to cash out on their holdings, **all at your expense**.  Don't believe me, go check it out here for yourself. You believe you are doing well saving a dying company, but you are just helping company insiders become rich.

Please always do your own DD, and please apply some common sense, it would go a long way in saving, and eventually making some money.

seslmz,2022-01-28 14:54:43,"Explosion of the Memestocks, Address to the Sub, January 28, 2022","Ladies and gentlemen, I'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the S&P500, which is in absolute shambles, but the events of the past several months have led me to change those plans. Today is a day for mourning and remembering.

u/zjz and I are entertained to the core by the tragedy of the rocketship GME. We know we share this joy with all of the people of subreddit. This is truly a global shitshow.

Twelve months ago, almost to the day, we gained millions of subscribers on a brilliant mission to the moon. But we've never lost our shirts in unison like this; we've never collectively gotten crushed like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the holders of the stock; but they, the retarded apes, were aware of the dangers, but bought shares and DRS'd them anyways. We mourn the losses millions of retards who bought high and sold low along the way.

For the families of the apes, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of the knowledge that apes are retarded. But we feel their stupidity, and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, ""Give me a stock, and I'll tell all my friends to buy it."" They had a hunger to explore the markets and discover its frauds. They wished to destroy the hedgies, and they did. They destroyed Citron.

We've grown tired of the conspiracy theories on this stock. It's hard to entertain us. But for 10 years this Monday, wallstreetbets shitposting has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of high quality shitposts, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're 11.5 million shitposters strong.

And I want to say something to the paint eaters of SuperStonk who are holding onto the stock for dear life. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes other stocks exist on the market. It's all a part of having an economy with more than one company in it. It's all part of having a place for discussion that isn't a cultlike echochamber shouting the same thing over and over. The riches of the market don't belong to those who invest without doing their own research; it belongs to the DD posters who can defend their thesis against derision with verifiable facts. DeepFuckingValue and his detailed DDs was pulling us into riches, and we'll continue to do quality research that would make him proud.

I've always had great faith and respect for our DD posters, and what happened with the nonstop ""squeeze DD"" trash that followed GME does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our losses. We don't delete our incorrect DDs after the fact. We review them publicly and learn from them. That's the way high quality discussion happens, and we wouldn't change it for a minute.

We'll continue our quest for tendies. There will be more hilarious shitposts and god tier DD, and, yes, more dumb memes that people upvote for god knows why. Nothing ends once you're bankrupt; there's always someone willing to lend you money.

I want to add that I wish I could talk to every bear who posts on WSB or who submitted a trash tier meme and tell them: ""Your dedication and steadfastedness have moved and impressed us for years. Although we don't understand the nature of your brain damage, we want you to know, stocks only go up.""

There's a coincidence today. On this day 36 years ago, the great explorer Michael Smith/Scott flew the spaceship Challenger. In his lifetime the great barriers to making gains were $45 commissions for trading, and a CNBC analyst later said, ""They got their stock tips from their friends at the pub, which was a lot worse than randomly guessing."" Well, today we can say of the WSB crew: Their willingness to believe in random strangers on the internet was equally ill advised.

The apes of the moon mission GameStop and others honored us by the manner in which they shit all over the subreddit. We will never forget them, mostly because they will probably stick around for years, telling us of their journey, and wishing us losses as we continue to bet everything on companies with zero revenue and huge losses.

mhthzn,2021-04-01 11:43:48,Crash alert. Infra plan is a disappointing trojan horse for taxes,"The details of the Biden infrastructure plan are now out and let's just say that it is a huge disappointment. We were hoping for unbridled spending instead we get one time, highly precise spending items and a reversal of the Trump tax plan and then some more...

The reconciliation was meant to allow the dems to spend without any concession of tax increases but it seems that progressive dems want to raise taxes...for the purpose of raising taxes. The sellside is only starting to catch up to this reality.

First here is a summary of the tax initiatives by GS:

**A 28% corporate rate**: President Biden proposed this during the presidential campaign. Each percentage point of corporate tax rate increase raises a little over $100bn over ten years in tax revenue, so this proposal would raise between $700-800bn/10 years. *We think Congress can raise the rate to 24-25%, but might start to run into resistance among centrist Democrats between 26% and 28%.\**

**Tightening GILTI**: Similar to the Biden campaign proposal, the White House proposes to raise the effective tax rate on Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) to 21% from an effective rate of 10.5% today, move the system to a country-by-country basis that would keep companies from using tax credits from high tax jurisdictions to offset GILTI earnings in low tax jurisdictions, and rescind the policy that applies the tax to income only above a 10% return on physical capital. This would mean that the GILTI regime would apply to most companies with foreign income rather than just to IP-intensive industries like healthcare and technology, and would likely also raise taxes for companies that currently have little to no GILTI exposure. The Tax Policy Center estimated the campaign proposal would raise $442bn over ten years.

**Other international tax changes** The White House release appears to contemplate replacing the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), saying that it would replace “an ineffective provision in the 2017 tax law that tried to stop foreign corporations from stripping profits out of the United States.” It also proposes to eliminate Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII), which encouraged US-based companies to hold their IP in the US by setting an effective tax rate on that income similar to the effective tax rate on IP held abroad and taxed through the GILTI regime.

**A minimum tax on book income** The proposal would also establish a 15% minimum tax on corporate book income reported to investors, which would serve as a check against companies that report large profits to shareholders but no profits to the IRS. The campaign proposal would have applied this globally on a country-by-country basis, but the White House release indicates only that it would apply this only to “the very largest corporations.”

**New restrictions on inversion**s The White House does not define what this would be, but inversions are likely to play a larger role in tax policy if the rest of the proposal were to pass, as the US would then have a high tax on the foreign earnings of multinationals compared with most other developed countries that rely on mainly

territorial tax systems.

**Ed Yardeni**, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, wrote this week that Biden's proposed 28% corporate tax rate, if implemented, ""would reduce S&P 500 earnings per share by $15, to $200 in 2022.""

That 7% haircut is likely more than Wall Street has been pricing in. **UBS** equity strategist Keith Parker wrote on March 9 that he anticipates a 3.6% hit to EPS from Biden's tax plan.

Parker wrote that hiking the tax rate on long-term capital gains from **20% to 39.6% could slice 1.5 points off the S&P 500 P/E multiple,** potentially another 7% hit. UBS expects that not quite half that tax hike will become law.

==============================================

The only reason the sellside isn't outright bearish yet is because they seem to think that only a watered down version of this bill will pass. that's not true. via reconciliation what Biden wishes is what happens there is only one limiting swing vote in practice and that is senator Joe Manchin. Guess what the man is fine with a tax hike of A*T LEAST 25% so he LOVES THIS:*

>While he didn't predict a price tag, Manchin said Congress should do ""everything we possibly can"" to pay for it. He said there should be ""tax adjustments"" to former President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law to boost revenues, including by raising the corporate rate from the current 21 percent to at least 25 percent.

## So for now i definitely don't see how the market can get away with pricing NONE OF THIS. BUY PUTS.

Moving on to other asset classes which will explain why I only anticipate a drawdown of 5% :

the phasing of the plan is problematic in that infra plans tend to take a long time to start hitting GDP while the taxes hit will be immediate hence it will reduce 2022 GDP growth. Without writting a whole article about the situation at the FED, the market is currently pricing a full hike in 2022 DEC. That is the most insane thing this market has ever done since GME. IT IS NOT HAPPENING.

## BUY ED DEC 2022

and the pricing out of these hikes that are not happening will help with NQ's valuation and compensate for a point or half a point of P/E hence the 5% figure.

17rlr06,2023-11-09 20:06:43,Bitcoin is going to the fucking moon.,"Hello dumb fucks,

I’ve been watching Bitcoin and the crypto sphere for quite some time now, I really do believe Bitcoin could see an exponential increase of value here soon. Here are my reasons being:

1. Bitcoin is theoretically the best hedge against inflation. 

2. Current monetary assets are not backed by any real commodity. 

3. The theory behind Bitcoin and the idea of scarcity will be key to keeping this monetary asset as a highly valuable item. 

4. As the internet grows (and I believe it will grow even more within the next decade as we become more interdependent on the web and the innovation behind technology forcing us to keep up with current technological trends) will force us to think about buying commodities that will allow us to have leverage in transactions over the internet

5. Optimism is growing. With the introduction of spot ETFs and the 4 year “halving”, this could realistically fuel a massive bull run as it creates a sense of panic for retail investors to start buying up Bitcoin commodities to not feel left out. 

6. The classic hype surrounding scarcity. As is the same idea with diamonds, gold, and birkins, the price point is driven higher with low supply and high demands.

7. Bitcoin is becoming a more popular transaction method around the world. 

Now, I know many of you have probably come to some if not all of these conclusions on your own, but what do we make of the early bull run rotations and do we think it is feasible?",0,0.46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17rlr06/bitcoin_is_going_to_the_fucking_moon/,wallstreetbets
1cqrsoz,2024-05-13 05:33:53,Blackberry is well positioned to profit from automotive momentum. EV adoption expected to reach 80% by 2030,"Blackberry created partnerships with leading Chinese EV makers. This was a brilliant farsighted move by then CEO John Chen who's original from China. Chen was a big asset to Blackberry because he spoke Chinese and understood the culture. Blackberry partnered with BYD well before they became the top EV seller in the world ahead of Tesla. Other notable partnerships, XPend and Xiaomi. 

Chinese EV sales and production jumped almost eightfold between 2019-2023. China is the world's biggest auto market with 30 million cars sold in 2023. Although EV market share took six years to increase from 1% to 6% of the world global car sales. EV sales is expected to reach 80% adoption in the next six years by 2030. Chinese EV sales adoption is expected to reach 90% by 2030

Blackberry is positioned well to profit significantly from automotive momentum and industry transformation. 

Institutions are betting big on Blackberry in vote of confidence that the company can execute extremely well on the revenue growth strategy. There is a big growth potential especially in the IoT. Fairfax Financial, Vanguard Group Inc and First Trust Advisors LP increased their positions in Blackberry and they continue to hold millions of shares. 

On April 3 during Q4 FY24 Blackberry delivered impressive results beating the street estimates. 

On April 9 Blackberry and AMD announced a partnership on advancing Robotics technology. Lisa Su CEO of AMD selected Blackberry.

17xggdk,2023-11-17 14:36:51,Unpopular opinion: Elon Musk buying Twitter was a genius move,"Most people don't realize how valuable is Twitter in general, and for Musk in particular. 

Let's start with the general value for any owner: 

* Twitter is massive: 0.5 billion monthly users, across much of the world.
* It it especially popular among influential people: Twitter has the majority of top politicians, scientists, billionaires, writers, celebrities, etc. So, the owner of Twitter has the power to influence the people who run this planet. 
* Twitter is a massive data trove for training powerful artificial intelligence (AI). There are only a few bigger sources of data in the world.  

Twitter is especially useful for Elon Musk:

* The majority of traditional media is biased against him and his companies, for various reasons (from oil lobby to the left-leaning journalists being the majority). In the situation, it's nice to have your own mass media with 0.5 billion readers. 
* Musk's account on Twitter is one the biggest ones by the followers count, and it was so before the acquisition. Currently, he has about 160 million followers. And Twitter is the main PR channel for Musk. Buying Twitter allows him to keep it up and running.
* Tesla is basically a robots company, making robots on wheels. And the manufacturing process heavily depends on robotics too. To make smarter robots, you need smarter AIs, and for this you need a lot of training data. And Twitter happens to be one of the biggest sources of such data. This could be especially relevant for the Tesla's android project, which supposedly will have the ability to follow instructions in natural language. 
* As I understand, Musk sees the far-left as an enemy of the Western civilization. Owning a major social network allows him to counter this threat, and to promote his political views at scale.
* And his companies can run ads on Twitter for free.
* It seems that since the PayPal days, he has the idea of building an ""everything app"", something like one of those extremely popular Chinese apps, where you can do practically everything human-related from a single app, from chatting to sending money to do dating to buy pizza to hire people etc. Twitter seems to be an excellent start for that. 

Was it worth 44 billion for Musk? 

His net worth was about 250 billion at the time of the purchase. And his net worth today is again about 250 billion. So, the purchase has basically zero negative effect for him. But he has gained all the listed advantages. 

If I were in his position, I would've made the same decision.",0,0.47,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17xggdk/unpopular_opinion_elon_musk_buying_twitter_was_a/,wallstreetbets

-	Most of the buying movement in GME is personal greed.

-	Bankruptcy doesn’t always destroy a business if the underlying is good. Instead, it reorganizes it.

z20m60,2022-11-22 18:15:44,UPDATE: I may have single handedly saved my local GameStop 🚀🚀🚀,"**This is an update to** [**the original post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ytcgx9/i_may_have_single_handedly_saved_my_local_gamestop/) **from about 10 days ago**

After the rousing support I received from the community, I went back to check up on things at the store. This time, I brought along a clipboard so that I could document my findings and try out the demerit system that me and some of the guys (also ladies ;\]) on the SuperStonk discord server came up with for our retail employees.

I approached the storefront and pushed open both doors at the same time like an old-timey saloon. **They didn't make a sound. Not a squeak** \- GameStop has some seriously high quality doors guys.

""Hey there, welcome in."" shouted an employee from the back of the store.

I confidently strode up to address them at the counter, glancing around the store for any issues with nothing jumping out at me.""Not bad, kid,"" I remarked to him. ""Not bad at all. Looking pretty good in here. Is the manager around?"".

Visibly confused he said ""Uh, I'm the manager. Is something wrong?"".

""No, no, no, just wanted to ensure that we have a manager on duty, as it's part of the checklist.""

""Checklist?"" he asked. ""What checklist?"".

""The checklist that we the shareholders have drawn up for our retail employees. It's mostly the same stuff you've aways done, but now there's a demerit system so that we can track and punish employees for bad behavior/poor performance.""

He began to shake his head & choke out a response, but I abruptly cut him off.

""Anyway, I gotta jet. Keep up the good work, and maybe you'll get a nice NFT bonus for Christmas.""

I turned on my heel to leave when lo and behold - who do I see but the kid from last time, walking in late watching TikToks on his phone.

""Well, well, well,"" I smugly said, crossing my arms with a smirk dancing across my lips. ""Look who decided to show up.""

The kid looked up in surprise and his eyes immediately grew to the size of dinner plates.

""That's the guy!"" he shouted to the manager behind me. ""That's the guy I told you about the other day, the one from corporate"".

""You work at the corporate office?"" the manager asked me.

""Not physically, but I am however a partial owner of the company"".

""Dude, look, you don't work here,"" he suggested. ""I don't care if you own a couple of shares or whatever, you can't be coming in here being rude to us. Why do you care so much about this place anyway?"".

Now, I'm not a very big guy (5'4 ¾), but I sized him up and was pretty sure that if push came to shove I could take him.

""Why do I care?"" I mirrored back to him, stealthily adjusting my feet into a fighting stance. ""Ever heard of a dark pool? How about a short ladder? Maybe a cellar box? No? Well that's is what we're up against, **and it's a fucking war.** You think that hiring little piss worms like this kid right here who come in late every day and allows people steal Funko Pops anytime they want is helping the battle? That's a demerit. Congrats on earning the first one in GameStop history, kid.""

He threatened to call the police, so I chose to be the bigger person and leave as to not disturb any customers when they begin to pour in.

**TLDR;** I was able to weed out a bad manager at a GameStop location who didn't align with our values as shareholders. I will be calling the corporate office to demand his termination, as well as request to participate in the interview for his replacement.

I know what you apes are probably thinking: that this is good, they’re trimming the fat, RC Cola and friends will remain and save the day - the layoff INCLUDES new hires from Chewie and Amazon.  Say what you want about the future of the company, but 20% layoffs are never a good sign.  I have a pretty good feeling that Royal Caribbean’s resurrection plan isn’t going so great.  His success with Chewie is starting to look less like mastery of business and more like right place at the right time.

**Debt**

**Future Box Office Slate**

**Film Exhibition Cost**
 
**A Scumbag CEO Who Exploits Underage Ballerinas**

Before COVID hit they were sort of making a profit and had assets to cover liabilities by a slight margin

That margin tightened in 2019 and by 2020 they were officially in the hole which has grown to $3 billion 

They refinanced most of the debt in 2020 and that starts to mature in 2024 and again in 25/26/27 if they make it that far

Now that they have blown through all the postponed COVID blockbusters and a pretty solid 2023 film slate and still have shitty financials it’s over

Plus all the film distributors are dicking them over on box office splits using streaming platforms as leverage 

If a movie does better than expected they go back and ask for more money 

The 2024/2025 film slate is embarrassing

🇺🇸 As far as specifications go, we know that the four in-wheel hub motors produce a total of 600 HP (608 HP), enough for a 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) sprint of 5.5 seconds and a governed top speed of 80 mph (128 km/h).

The 80 mile per hour limit is a standard set based on feedback from fleet managers.  The true story is that customers and fleet managers can remove the governor 100%.

🇺🇸 There are three brand new stamping presses that are worth about $24M. If we were to replace even one of our stamping lines, it would cost over $30M each.

The factory is comprised of over 6M square feet and fully owned by Lordstown Motors.

🇺🇸 The hub motors will be validated for 100,000 miles and require little maintenance, Post said during the tour: “The hub motor itself will never need service.” 

He then said the motor “doesn’t break,” explaining, “There's no oil, there's no pistons and those are lifetime bearings for the vehicle.”

We are completely confident for the hub motor manufacturing readiness. Hub motor assembly... This area covers 400,000 square feet and has annual capacity for 240,000 hub motors.  all of our manufacturing equipment has been built, validated, and has been shipped.  We will be starting our installation and commissioning process in the next two weeks.   We will be ready to continue producing hub motors, now in house.  - Restated June 25, 2021.

🇺🇸 Endurance Production is September with conservative 20,000 units being delivered by May 2022.   They’ve been clear that the ATVM Loan or asset backed financing will speed up the production ramp up to double.  The van prototype is being completed and will be displayed “by the end of summer.”  Military prototypes were onsite and driven during Lordstown Week.

🇺🇸 General assembly from when we first receive the cab until when we can drive the endurance off the end of the line is eight hours.  Our system is flexible enough that we can change some gapping and line speed, reducing down to as low as four hours.

We can build 30 jobs per hour in the body shop. There are 900 robots, just in the body shop.

🇺🇸 Our battery packs are warrantied for 8 years, 100,000 miles.  We do not expect any degredation prior to the warranty expiration.  Level 2 charging, maximum AMP is about 45 amps, using 11KW charger.  We do have high speed DC charging, which is 470 amps using 150KW charger.

Battery Pack protected perfectly.  Cooling is built in.

The battery shop is led by 25-year experience engineer that came from Tesla.

🇺🇸 There are eight color pallets: electric white, grit grey, titanium silver, and nightshift black.  Premium color: Forest Service Green, Municipal Yellow, Petrol Blue Metallic, and Town Red.

🇺🇸 “…extremely flexible platform that will be the foundation of all future models....""

🇺🇸 Seasoned, experienced management with more coming on board.  Solid orders for two years, 85% retooled and 60,000 capacity by September.

🇺🇸 During the zoom call with Automotive Press Association on Tuesday, June 15th, 2021 Lordstown President Rich Schmidt said, ""We will sell and deliver at least 20,000 vehicles by May 2022. These are confirmed firm orders.”

🇺🇸 Former GM Director, Global Retail & Sales Technology, John R Whitcomb joins Lordstown as Vice President, Global Commercial Operations To Lead Company’s Go-To-Market Strategy 
 
Mr. Whitcomb has over 30 years of diverse global automotive experience, leveraging his broad expertise in strategy, business development, process design, operational execution and information technology to address complex, transformative challenges within the auto industry. Most recently, he served as a Managing Director, Global Automotive and Mobility, at Ernst & Young LLP, where he supported global OEM client innovation and transformation initiatives, and previously at General Motors as Director, Global Retail & Sales Technology, where he was responsible for establishing common, best practice business processes and the supporting technology for GM’s global sales operations, distribution network planning and analysis, and retail execution areas.

🇺🇸 Received FMVSS Penetration Requirements exceeded.  Final certification test will be early fourth quarter.

🇺🇸 LORDSTOWN EXECS CONFIRM... ""We've never seen a broken hub motor... You will break a wheel before you break a motor.""

🇺🇸 Unsprung Mass: The external Legal review including a panel of engineers and the Special Committee concluded that while hub motors have not previously been used at scale in commercially-produced passenger vehicles, the hub motor technology licensed from Elaphe is viable. The Endurance was engineered to address the unsprung vehicle mass attributable to in-wheel motors, including through tuning of the suspension, reinforcing the vehicle structure, and utilizing a heavier truck chassis.

vtn2u4,2022-07-07 16:47:27,GME stock dividend is not the same as stock split dammit!!!,"EDIT:

ok lets go back to basic math.

If there is 1000 share. and gme declare 1 dollar dividend per share

and there is 200 share that is shorted.

short seller need to pay the dividend, which is 200 dollar.

&#x200B;

so now, will GME pay out 800 dollar or 1000 dollar?

clearly only 800 right? because the other 200, already got paid by short seller.

&#x200B;

or are you saying gme pay 1000 in dividend, and short seller pay 200. for a total of 1200 in dividend?

&#x200B;

so what is it? will gme pay 800 in dividend, and short seller pay 200

or will gme pay 1000 and short seller pay 200?

&#x200B;

we all know gme does not pay 1000, short seller pay 200 because that would be an extra 200 of dividend that doesnt go anywhere,

we know short seller has to pay 200 in dividend.

that mean, gme ONLY need to come up with 800 in dividend, not 1000.

&#x200B;

hopefully all the people that say i am wrong can figure out the logic, but then we are on WSB so probably not. LOL

&#x200B;

EDIT EDIT:

ok so 1000 share. 1 dollar dividend. assume only 1 person own all 1000 share.

A get 1000 in dividend.

S borrow 200 share. and they sold it to B

B now own 200 ""borrowed share""

S need to pay 200 to B for dividend.

S need to pull $200 out of his ass, to pay B. does S go back to A and say hey let me borrow 200 to pay B? nope, he get it from his ass. This cost him $200 dollar.

&#x200B;

So now, change it to stock dividend.

A get 1000 stock as dividend from GME

S borrow 200 share, sold it to B

B now own 200 share. and need to receive 200 share in dividend from S

S need to pull out 200 share from his ass to give to B. His ass doesn't have any. he can't get it from his ass. So he goes back to his buddy A, and say he you got some extra share, I need to borrow it also. A goes what the hell? when money was given, you pull it out of your ass, but now it's shares, your ass don't have it huh? and you want to borrow it from me? ok, but it will be 1 million ok? you know, supply, demand, times are changing, inflation, i need to pay my wife's BF??

larxmg,2021-02-02 09:32:16,Going against the grain and looking at possible exits for GME in the worst case,"This is probably going to get downvoted to oblivion but after being very bullish last Thursday I have **changed** my opinion over the weekend and yesterday.

&#x200B;

It seems a lot of people here are emotional and are just in it to stick to wallstreet. 

Personally, I am not part of wallstreetbets to stick it to anyone or to make myself be a martyr for any cause. I am in it to make money. While I personally support a lot of views here and the blatant bs that is happening in form of **market manipulation**, brokers like RH having issues with their **clearing houses** (or so they claim) and **restricting trading**, **media**, and a bunch of other infuriating factors makes me pissed too. 

However, hijacking the sub just for GME and not burying all other DD is just dumb. 

&#x200B;

**But the moment you start investing with your emotions you lose.**

At the moment I feel extremely blind since I do not know what is real and what is manufactured info and we do not know the real short interest. **That plus all these emotions from people here is** making me uneasy.

&#x200B;

# I am trying to look for a potential exit.

Based on the short interest reported being so low, it seems a lot of shorts have covered their positions (this could be manipulated data but we have to go on what we have). It seems they did most of their covering AH and during retail sell-offs that they artificially created by manipulating the price in AH.

&#x200B;

# Retail vs Institution change in the charts:

It does seem that most of retail has gotten in on Monday and Tuesday and that after that it was institutions playing their games. You can see this by how radically different the graphs look for days after Tuesday of last week.

&#x200B;

[Volume and the movement of price is completely different after Wednesday  which makes me think it is institutions and other hedge funds that got it to trade volatility, notice the massive price gaps AH ](https://preview.redd.it/evdnw7xd71f61.png?width=1545&format=png&auto=webp&s=5594df708bbf563cc18f4e1ddf06d53139fdb54d)

&#x200B;

This with the addition of restriction of retail buyers is making me bearish because I believe that the shorts managed to get out during this time and the new shorts got in while the older ones blew up earlier and have covered during AH.

&#x200B;

# Supports to avoid shakeouts:

It seems that the last support level around $160 range if broken is what would trigger me to sell. There was one wick that went as low as $110 on the 28th, this is a problem because during the free fall of the breakers it broke through the $160 support like nothing yet recovered. Setting a stop loss at $160 could cause your position to just be shaken out. But setting your stop loss at $110 or below is too low imo but could be a reasonable stop loss to prevent getting shaken out of your position if you believe the short squeeze is still coming.

&#x200B;

[Trying to avoid getting shaken out at $110, this was probably their test to see how low they can flash crash the price to pick up as many shares if they were to cover their shorts.](https://preview.redd.it/bxtxqa4n71f61.png?width=1543&format=png&auto=webp&s=567bd77db52fe4b7a2bc4b5664664f36944d1e7f)

&#x200B;

# Comparison with VW in 2008

The balancing act here is finding the sweet spot where you will not get shaken out in case the data is manipulated and the squeeze rockets to $1000+/share but also not to be low enough that your losses are massive.

&#x200B;

[You want to avoid selling here and not get shaken out \( I believe that would be $110 for GME\)](https://preview.redd.it/my0icm4s71f61.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=5772850ff659033abbc5e03a3c2bff38976c5e54)

&#x200B;

If you are more conservative I would take the profits around 160, if you want to potentially wait for squeeze and not get shaken out $110 seems like a reasonable stop loss.

Depending on the pre-market sentiment by morning I will be looking to either get out at 160 or holding.

&#x200B;

I am not trying to scare anyone just trying to do my own exit strategy, Do your own research. I do not have a crystal ball. After the official short interest is released I may look to reenter the position in GME if I get out, but profit is profit till then.

Robinhood is probably the most undervalued company in the entire market at the moment.

**A conservative assessment of their balance sheet and metrics:**

Market Cap: $6.90B USD

Balance Sheet (Cash + other assets) : $6.5B USD

Yearly Revenue (forward looking): \~$2.2 B

Yearly Expenses (forward looking): \~$1.9B

Expected Profit (forward looking): \~$300 million

**Adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months : $485 million**

&#x200B;

Now here's the kicker:

Everybody thinks they're losing customers becaue their MAU number is going down. I don't know why they report it the way that they do. The real number that matters is the number of Gold subscribers. That is the REAL number of users. MAUs are fickle and unreliable number that doesn't really matter.

The # of Gold users has been growing at >20% YOY very consistently, and has consistent quarter over quarter growth.

This is a growing business with an extremely strong balance sheet. Also, they are probably the brokerage that treats their customers the best (5% APY, free trades, 24/7 customer support, extremely good UI, probably the best spreads on crypto in the industry).

Conservatively, this should be trading at 20 P/E + $6 billion = $12 billion market cap.

10pjbhi,2023-01-31 00:41:42,"Game Theory: The war will end soon, oil will plummet, Biden will get re-elected","r/wallstreetbets/comments/sshs8f/game_theory_putin_will_invade_ukraine_what_stocks

From my previous prediction (I got shit on predicting Russia will invade and to by boil), I believe everything runs on game theory.

Edit: I didn’t go into the game theory, I briefly mentioned it. Biden and allies vs putin. They have interdependent decisions to make. But ah well, forgot this is wsb and everyone is a regard, ie I should have spelled it out. But google game theory and understand the full context of what is happening 

So from recent events, I’m back to posting about game theory and predict what will happen.

1. The war is nearly over
2. It’ll cause oil to dump hard
3. World will enter deflation since we have supply surpluses and abundant energy and oil.
4. Fed will pivot
5. QE will begin
6. Ukraine will be the next money pit
7. Biden will be re-elected 

Main is number 1. Putin only has 2 options now, nuke or negotiate. US and nato allies know this, so they’ll push until they know they can’t anymore anymore and pivot to negotiations. Biden will “broker” the negotiation. It’ll cause Russia to start selling oil again. Saudi’s will be scared that US and Russia are on talking terms again and begin to let the oil flow. (Not sure if Biden will hold a grudge against Saudi Arabia, they may).

Oil and gas will drop insanely. That coupled with surplus supply and unemployment happening, fed will have to pivot.

Depending on how mad unemployment actually is, fed may have to cut interest rates and may have pause QT.

I expect stock market to fly, but if for some reason it doesn’t, QE will happen.

Biden will use ending the war and reversing inflation. They’ll also blame inflation of trump.

Biden will get re-elected.

Mainly, the conflict only has 2 ways to go now, Putin pushes the button or Putin stops the war. Since this is a 0 sum game, the war will end.

Caveat, if putin is actually sick and doesn’t give a f about anything, buy a bunker! 🤣",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10pjbhi/game_theory_the_war_will_end_soon_oil_will/,wallstreetbets

leqhhy,2021-02-07 17:06:40,"GME, Mob Mentality, and the irresponsibility of Reddit hype.","

This isn't new, but the extremes have moved significantly.  Never before have I seen so many people lose so much out of sheer ignorance. 

**First and foremost I want to establish a fact: Short squeezes are not permanent.**

I made a post a week ago telling everyone that short squeezes were not permanent.  GME opened at over $300 that day.  By Friday it would close at $63.  The mechanics of a short squeeze make this an inevitability.  They are, by definition, a short term event fueled by a sudden spike in demand, an unsustainable spike in demand driven by short covering.  That demand is necessarily going to end.  So, when you see a stock skyrocket from the 20s to over 300 in the matter of a week taking a long position is a less constructive use of your money than just burning cash for heat.

**What this isn't: an ""I told you so"".**

  I don't really care about that.  The red on the ledger is enough for people to eventually learn they were wrong.  Sure, they'll grovel about conspiracies for a bit, Janet Yellen called Vlad and told him to fuck the retail investors.  Hedge funds had a ""short ladder attack"" (for why that's not a rea, [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the_myth_of_the_short_ladder_attack/) or [here](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qdq0y5b79rzb/Wallstreetbets-Conspiracy-Theorists-Claim-a-Short-Ladder-Attack-Brought-Down-GameStop-Short-Sellers-Have-No-Idea-What-They-re-Talking-About).  They'll claim that the DTC intentionally stopped out retail order flow, despite retail orders being [net sells](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop) for most of this endeavor.  Whatever, so you're going to see a lot of blame on anything but the fact that it's obviously not smart to go long at the top of a goddamn short squeeze.  This is the financial equivalent of doing 150MPH on a dirt road then blaming the tires, the loose gravel, the 2mph headwind, or interstellar radio waves altering your tire pressure when you crash.  No, you shouldn't have been doing 150MPH on a dirt road. 

_______

**What this is: reflecting on the mob**

The shameful part of this is that in your foaming at the mouth rabid need to believe in this story you downvoted and ridiculed anyone who brought up risks, you attacked news agencies who called it irresponsible, you barraged threads and subreddits with hype posts.  For the first time in this sub's entire history we actually had to restrict posting

I spoke with a reporter for a major publication working on this story, and he relayed that he recently interviewed a homeless man who bought three shares at $315 hoping to get himself out of poverty.  do you know how much $945 can do for a homeless person??  There's [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/la3bft/emotional_involvement_has_never_been_this_high/glob1kf/?context=3), where a disabled man on government support hopes to build a house with GME gains, again buying in near the top.  These are two examples, but there are hundreds if not thousands more.

20 year old middle class kids blowing their beer money for the month on GME doesn't bother me.  who cares.  But these are people who cannot afford to  a few hundred dollars.  These are setbacks that could have equated to months worth of food, new wardrobes, necessary medical attention, etc. 

We can never prevent those in poor financial situations from making poor decisions, but we can and absolutely should hold ourselves to the standard that we will at least not foster an environment that encourages poor decisions.  Many of you will lay blame elsewhere, but if you downvoted a post discussing risks of GME, accused someone of being a shill, encouraged someone to buy without first understanding their situation, etc. then you are culpable here.  

------

**You can, but should you?**

Much has been said about Reddit's ability to affect the outside world, and now just like with the Boston bombing everyone dove in head first without bothering to examine the risks, the drawbacks, the losses, and the ramifications for those who can't afford them.  

**So, what did Reddit accomplish here?**

Ultimately, nothing aside from transferring a lot of retail wealth to institutional funds, again.  Sure, we can jerk off all day to Melvin's down month.  Perhaps they were hedged and they'll have a monster January, perhaps they were not.  But all of the other funds that took the long end of this early on, with managers that understood the aspects of short squeezes - they bailed out in the 200-300 range selling some to short and some to unwitting retail investors engaged in a fervent and ultimately useless battle against some imaginary foe.  

This wasn't social justice, it wasn't some populist uprising, and I don't care how much AOC, Ted Cruz, Mark Cuban, or the Pope wants to dogpile in on this.  There was nothing that happened here aside from a bunch of retail traders who didn't know what they were doing encouraging a whole lot of other retail investors who couldn't afford it to give away money they didn't have to institutions.  

Next time y'all want to effect change just have a charity drive for UNICEF, or send money to a PAC focused on fighting inequality.  Write your senator, picket congress (peacefully, no mob bullshit), organize a sit in, whatever.  But let's not encourage broke people to give their hard earned thousands to hedge funds.  

**And most importantly, the next time this happens, because it will happen again, for the love of shitt try to understand what the fuck is going on before jumping on the hype train.  And stop downvoting and ridiculing people that do understand what is happening with an opinion you don't like.**

t2y2yt,2022-02-27 21:17:20,Evidence: We are already in 'WWIII' and we are having trouble admitting it,"[Instant Updates](https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/russia-continues-ukraine-invasion-live-updates) reveal that all U.S. ambassadors are leaving Russia.  Russia has also threatened Nuclear War, in raising the readiness to use its nuclear stockpile.  Further, Russia has surrounded and physically encircled Kyiv.  This, eventually will starve out millions of innocent civilians in Ukraine.

Further, in the middle of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russia spoke with Iran, a country which routinely shouts ""Death to America.""  Also, China's #1 grossing film of 2021 was ""The Battle at Lake Changjin.""  Hundreds of times in this film oh, that I personally watched, Americans were being depicted as Nazi-like people. This was a state-driven, pre-conflict propaganda movie.  Everyone should see how 'the West' is being falsely depicted.  And today, we can see that Russia's main propaganda arm, while he invades Ukraine, is to 'denazify' Ukraine, which makes no sense because Ukraine's president is Jewish.

Reports now show China leaked U.S.-provided intel back to Russia.  Yesterday, North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.  Today, China spoke with North Korea, citing [a ""new situation,""](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-message-nkoreas-kim-vows-cooperation-under-new-situation-kcna-2022-02-25/) on the same day that Russia has threatened nuclear war. And finally, it should be noted that China spoke out in its ""support' of Russia during this situation.

TLDR: We are already living in World War III and we are all failing to admit that.  Wake up and BET accordingly. ""The Great Reset"" in global markets will now occur. I'll be looking at the kings and queens of 'meme' stocks to see some particular fireworks there, as I see them now as the best companies with the highest level of support.

Their market share will only decrease from here, Tesla Semi will not change that, in 5 years they will not even be a top 5 EV manufacturer.

Tesla created the EV market, no one can deny that. Companies become market makers by creating and cornering a market before there is real competition, then staying ahead of the newcomers.

New companies try to create new markets all the time. Few are successful. Even fewer create truly NEW markets, most are just iterations past old norms. EV vehicles are not a new market, they are an iteration on the norms of the consumer vehicle market. This means Tesla not only has to defend against newcomers to the consumer electric vehicle space, but they have to compete against very successful consumer vehicle manufacturers altering their established brands in EV's.

The F-150 is best selling truck, for decades, period. In the USA trucks have an exceptionally loyal customer base, and oversized market share. What Loyal Ford or Chevy owner would choose the cyber truck over the Lightning or Silverado EV? Its rhetorical moron, everyone knows there is not enough to be statistically relevant.

Tesla is only #1 in the EV space because they created that market and have not yet had to face real world competition. During that time they have failed to establish a market cornering brand. Right now Ford, Chevrolet, and Hyundai/Kia are all competing to be #2 in the EV market had have openly stated their intention to be #1 in the EV space in the next 5 years or so.

Before trying to mumble something about ""Tesla's innovation"" around Elon's dick, stop and think about this example. When Toyota entered the truck market they created a new ""small truck"" market. The overwhelming success of the Toyota truck that was eventually named the Tacoma launched them to success in the truck market. Nissan and other imports jumped on the small truck market, but the Nissan offering never hit it big in that space, Why? Because Ford launched the Ranger and Chevrolet the S10 and quickly claimed the #2 and #3 spots. Toyota is still a dominant player in ""small trucks"", but only barely and never managed to corner that market, and they were already a reputable and trusted car brand when they created that marked. Toyota is only dominant in the ""small"" truck space, their larger truck offerings cant come close to the F-150 or Silverado. Tesla was not a reputable or trusted manufacturer when they created this market, and I would argue still are not reputable or trustworthy. Look at Elon, he wasted $44 billion buying a social media company, just so he can ruin his reputation faster than he was by just being a social media user, how does that inspire trust in the brand?!?

Tesla Semi is not their savior, it is proof they are the Myspace of the social media world. Tesla created a market where no one thought one would exist (or so oil propaganda had everyone convinced), but now that the value behind the market has been established, how can Tesla out compete Ford or Toyota? All of Tesla's profitable models are in the ""luxury"" space where the margins are higher. Tesla is struggling to produce their still very expensive economy"" model 3, which can not compete against true ""economy"" EV's like the Leaf. Eventually Mercedes EV's will be preferred in the luxury EV space and the model 3 will never be able to compete with a Civic EV or Corolla EV. I am planning to buy an EV in 2024 and if there is a Civic EV, the Model 3 would have to have equal quality, and a LOWER price to even be considered, and would still also have to compete with Leaf etc. Why? Because Nissan entered the EV market years after Tesla, yet their very first EV, offered 2014, still sets a standard for quality/reliability in the EV space that Tesla can not equal even in 2021.

Kenny at the playground sold you 100 popsicle sticks at a markup of 10x for your school craft project because he stole them all from art supply closet..... no one likes Kenny. So you say hey you know what.... I’m gonna take these 100 popsicles and cut them all in half and now you have 200 popsicles and you resell them to Jennifer who really needs to get an A in class. Except Jennifer goes out and buys her own popsicles from store..... and the stores are saying they have at least 900 popsicles ready to go.... so Jennifer says I want 300.... but now the stores say hey.... we really only had 100 and Kenny just bought the last 100.... so now the popsicles are all
Gone! 

NO ONE HAS POPSICLES. So now Kenny can go sell them for as much as he wants because supply States so. 

In summary it takes us to buy the popsicles(physical silver) first in order to reveal behind the curtain that the stores (banks) don’t actually have as many popsicles as they say they do... therefore $SLV squooozeeees and we are all happy",0,0.46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/led04d/slv_this_is_the_way_allowed/,wallstreetbets

gonna start off with saying yeah i do regret not selling at the top as im sure alot of you do as well as much as youd not like to admit that, but assuming just like i you didnt expect it to peak at 30. and my fellow apes who will have to forfeit their wives to their respective boyfriends due to selling at a loss i do sympathize with you but this is where legends are made, right? or legendary autists on the contrary..

btw i have no evidence/TA for this thesis its just a working thesis, im sure there are apes here that are better qualified for the technicals behind this thesis if there are any..

enough words i guess here goes..

Despite MSM fud, BBBY does not announce bankruptcy and perhaps the announcement ends up being a positive one at that, retail starts fomoing in like clockwork, which drives the price up, at this point squeeze has potential, but imagine if and this is pure speculation here, Elon jumps in with a sizeable position, shorts r fuk?? 

now you might be wondering why for the love of god would elon jump in? and that would be a very valid question. IF he did, the simple reason would be because he hates hedgies that short companies to death with naked shorts just as much as RC and us apes, and there is already some evidence of a connection between RC and elon, so just a plausible theory imo. 

TLDR; im a bagholding regard and just speculating for hopium but feel free to throw salt on my wounds if youre a gay bear

tried posting this on the BBBY sub but wouldnt let me, apologies as i know alot of yall here are tired of this stock or have moved on

That was then, this is now, here's what we know:

* Wall street is rigged
* The buy pressure momentum got castrated mid climax 
* The shorts shorting at $10 probably got out at a loss, new shorts probably entered in the upper ranges and made bank
* The cost to all short holders is significantly depressed at the current market price. [Cheap shorts are available](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME).
* If there was a day of reckoning when shorts all had to buy-in at once it would certainly be ugly, the numbers don't lie, there are a lot of shares short out there that may be impossible to cover
* The only way for a buy-in to happen is upward momentum caused by buy-pressure
* Unless you guys have a bottomless money pit or major market participants enter that's probably not going to happen

o49rck,2021-06-20 16:48:36,HEAR ME OUT: WE SHORT EVERYTHING,"Let’s start with the obvious that everyone needs to be talking about; oil. 


The disconnect and overvaluation in oil futures is so fucking nonsensical that I would bet come Oct-Nov the average national US gas price will be in the 2.3-2.4 range, if not lower. The disconnect we’re seeing is something I’ve only found 2 other times in the last decade plus. The last time was in 2018. [In June the price average was 2.98, by Christmas and into early 2019 it sat 2.35-2.45.](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&f=m) Prior to 2018 it was 2008. A year in which the price of gas topped 4.11 avg. and by the end of the year was sitting in the 1.7-1.9 range, obviously the Great Recession contributed to it. Now here is 2021, the national average in May was 3.07 and the overvaluation is greater than 2018 but not as bad as 2007-2008 appeared. Food for thought.

&nbsp;

Next, the stock market is more overvalued than it has ever been. Ever. The [Total Market to GDP is 198% overvalued](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/60/ratio-of-wilshire-5000-over-gnp). For reference ‘Normal’ would be in the 95-120 range. If we look at the Top Stocks by Index weight the sign is not pretty. Tesla has begun it’s crack and it may just be a matter of weeks before its 50 Avg. falls below its 200 Avg. (for the dumb, that ain’t good.) Amazon and Apple have somewhat plateaued in recent months and show signs that a regress is in store. Basically the big weights holding this shit together is looking not good. We can take a look at the Dow and SP500 individually and it tells roughly the same story with the both taking a dump in the last few days.

&nbsp;


[The Fed has already begun to say the will not hike rates next year](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/feds-kashkari-opposed-to-rate-hikes-at-least-through-2023.html), we’re walking on egg shells and nobody anywhere is doing anything worthwhile to prepare for the worst. We’re using a condom we know has a hole in it we put there and know the partner isn’t on birth control. We’re playing with fire and about to get burnt, well poor people mostly because I’m sure they will take the majority of the blame with [the BS stories they’re pushing with UI benefits.](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/07/truth-behind-unemployment-benefits-myth)

&nbsp;


Basically I am expecting over the course of the next year or so for the beginning of a recession on par with or worse than 2008. I believe 2020 will be looked at as the body ache before the actual flu sets in. The signs are all there and will just become solidified over the coming months. Early this year the war was on Short Sellers now it needs to be on the bullish and the greedy because they and the current system are going to fuck us all over even more.

r608hf,2021-11-30 23:14:34,Current Problems with Apes,"Saw this as a comment and it was too good not to post. Reasons why Apes are hurting investing communities:

1. They intentionally try to reach the All front page in an attempt to recruit new people into their Ponzi scheme with promises of turning $200 into $60,000,000

2. They routinely make posts about how they’re forgoing medication, food, and shelter for themselves and loved ones so they can buy more shares

3. They’ve infested every single investing subreddit and control conversation through their brigading. A stock goes down? Well the reason is “crime” of course. That’s the highly upvoted answer on any investment sub. But don’t dare ask them to explain more, they can’t.

4. Remember when there was $1.40 worth of volume on Sears Canada the other day, a 320,000% increase in price? Well they were all over every investing sub talking about how criminal that $1.40 in volume was. What an absolutely retarded take.

5. They’re actively hoping for a cataclysmic market event that will destroy hundreds of millions of peoples lives, through hyperinflation on a scale never before seen, so they can finally be rich. All while claiming they’re just fighting greed. How the fuck does that square?

6. They use drones to spy on employees trying to do their jobs

7. They stalk airplanes and make highly upvoted posts like “hes landing, london apes do your thing”

8. They continually talk about violence, using guillotines to behead those who they deem are manipulating GameStop stock

Nah dude, fuck these cultist idiots. If they kept contained on their cult subs it’d be one thing. But that’s not enough. They need to control every single investing sub with their conspiratorial nonsense and continual efforts to get those with less knowledge to buy into their bullshit.
They’re also infested with a large contingent of Q folks, which will surely spread Q nonsense to an obviously gullible group. That’s dangerous for everyone.

1c2ad4f,2024-04-12 14:19:51,GoPro is ridiculously cheap fundamentally. ,"I think stock is should  atleast trade at 2-3x the current price.  Market cap is just 200 mil ? 

They have bought at least 40 mil in stocks in 2023. Are you kidding me?

Fundamental thesis: 
- Strategic Shift and Innovation: GoPro has evolved its business model from selling just hardware to combining hardware sales with subscription services and premium services launched in February 2024. This shift towards a more service-oriented model aims to provide a steady revenue stream and enhance customer loyalty.

- Financial Performance: GoPro has shown significant cash generation improvements over the years. For example, from an average cash usage of $46 million in the years before 2020, to generating $91 million and $221 million in subsequent years, although there was a slight dip to $2 million in cash generation in 2023. Despite this, GoPro managed to partially repay its convertible debt and repurchase $40 million in stock in 2023.

- Market Presence: GoPro has maintained its position as a leading brand in the U.S. camcorder market, with the HERO12 BLACK being the best-selling camera. The company boasts a strong social media presence with millions of followers and billions of lifetime views on its YouTube channel, indicating a robust market reach and brand recognition.

- Recent Acquisition: GoPro's acquisition of Forcite, aimed at enhancing the performance and safety of helmets, starting with motorcycle helmets, signals GoPro's intention to expand its market presence into new segments, leveraging its brand strength in motorsports and among motorcycle enthusiasts.

- Subscription Services Growth: The company has seen growth in its subscription services, with a notable increase in the average selling price (ASP) of its cameras and a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 69% for its subscription services. The subscriber renewal rates show increasing loyalty, with more than 80% renewal rate by the third year.

- Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): GoPro highlighted its commitment to CSR with initiatives like employee engagement, diversity, and sustainability goals. The company aims to source 100% renewable energy for its U.S. locations by 2026 and has disclosed its greenhouse gas emissions.

- Financial Highlights:  Revenue showed a slight decline in 2023 compared to previous years, but the adjusted EBITDA remained positive, indicating a healthy operational profit margin. There's also a notable shift in the MSRP camera revenue mix, with a higher percentage of cameras being sold at prices above $400 MSRP in 2023 compared to 2019.

Analyzing these points, GoPro's strategic focus on diversification through subscription services, its strong brand presence, and recent initiatives to penetrate new markets suggest a solid foundation for growth. While there was a dip in cash generation in 2023, GoPro's ability to maintain profitability and invest in strategic acquisitions and stock repurchases demonstrates financial resilience. Given this context, a market cap of $200 million might seem conservative, especially when considering the company's assets, equity, and strategic positioning for future growth. The information suggests that GoPro is actively working to expand and solidify its market presence, which could potentially increase its valuation in the eyes of investors looking beyond the immediate financial figures to the company's growth potential and strategic initiatives.",1,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c2ad4f/gopro_is_ridiculously_cheap_fundamentally/,wallstreetbets

Everyone knows “Ford” there’s rumors a merger with Tesla but I don’t think it would ever happen the brand “Ford” is like Disney to famous be acquired but it’s a possibility because Ford has the factories and can pump out tons of cars FAST something Tesla struggles with.

They are doubling down on EV now! Mache-e has the WOW factor which = free advertising for them via social media. Beats out Tesla in almost all the reviews. Seriously go google Mache-e.

The new Branco also has the wow factor! Legacy company and brands which = consumer loyalty. Has factories in place already ready to ramp up EV FAST!🚀🚀🚀🚀

F-150 going electric in a few years this is THE truck there really isn’t any other truck out there because Ford is undeniably the best truck maker in the world.

Vehicles cheaper because of EV government credits which Tesla doesn’t get anymore.🚀🚀🚀🚀

""Yup, Ford has all that, plus:

* 1 billion dollars investment and majority ownership in Argo AI which received a multi billion dollar investment from VW early last year. Argo AI is the team putting together Ford's autonomous vehicle. They must have been doing something right for VW to invest billions in them.
* Partnership with VW that allows Ford to use VW's MEB platform (ID3, ID4).
* 7.6% stake in Velodyne, a LIDAR company. How many autonomous vehicles do you see without LIDAR? No, not even the Tesla's with the ""full self driving beta"" are fully autonomous.

I've noticed that crispr (a very odd and ethically questioned biotech company that most of you have already heard of) has seen shares gone drop down about $49 (23.3%) this month.  Good time to buy?  Its financials actually shock me and I'm not sure if alot of this google data is actuate.  Nevertheless, I have heard from a source that this stock will turn profits of over 400 percent by 2026.

https://preview.redd.it/063s8uhzrmbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=275d71f796a94ef498d1090bdc32cfee474f44d3

Since we went off the gold standard, the stock market has not increased in real value. It has only preserved wealth. This can be further illustrated by dividing the S&P 500 by the M2 Money Supply.

https://preview.redd.it/q56zbzv0smbc1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=55f52f44ab422f53ce554e52a9b9c79ac6216a6c

But we have had gains in productivity over the last 50 years - Computers, The Internet, Automation, Globalization, Artificial Intelligence – where have all the gains in productivity gone? To the middle class? Obviously not, but let’s illustrate it anyways.

The government has effectively taxed all productivity gains in society at an average rate of 100% over the last 50 years - since we went off the gold standard.

If enough people care, I'll post a part 2 explaining how I think they've done this.

*Edit: I had no idea so many people invested in the S&P just for the 1.5% dividend, nor that they were able to perfectly reinvest their dividends without incurring any commissions, management fees, or taxes, for the last 50 years. You’ll all have to tell me your secrets.*

umyjua,2022-05-11 01:48:19,"Did some digging. Did you know the theories GME investors have about naked shorting are the same, recycled conspiracies from over a decade ago?","https://imgur.com/a/qDdRfD1

http://imgur.com/a/ffJNaC0

TL;DR: investors have been blaming negative price action on illegal naked shorting for decades. Modern day apes are using the same, rehashed arguments as their predecessors who fell for similar pump and dumps.

I recently went down a rabbit hole after reading the recent posts on SS about CMKM. Apes claim this case is evidence that trillions of ""fake shares"" are possible. I found the above article which perfectly describes the similar situation some CMKM investors found themselves in after the fraud committed by CMKM execs was exposed. Rather than accept their losses, they held onto the lie that it was all the fault of naked short sellers.

To be clear, I don't believe there has been any fraud at the GME exec level. The parallels I draw are between the investors that refuse to accept reality, and rather blame everything on naked short selling. In GME's case the fraudsters, in my opinion, are the DD writers. They recklessly mislead apes in fields they have no experience in. They misinterpret data and con the unknowing into believing a financial conspiracy. Not to mention the shameless self promotion of their paid services and fund raisers that we have seen from some mods.

Further parallels can be seen in the below article which states ""Some pranced around the offices of the villainous Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. in 2005 (I work there, according to these morons), made damned fools of themselves and diverted scarce police resources.""

http://garyweiss.blogspot.com/2009/09/indictments-in-cmkm-diamonds-naked.html?m=1

The article references another similar case, that of Universal Exchange. This is another example of a company exec using the excuse of naked short sellers to defraud investors.

https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/what-will-you-bid-for-a-lawsuit/

I find it quite hilarious that in the comments of the above article there are people making the same arguments as modern day apes. There are references to rule changes, rigging allegations, references to FTDs and allegations of people working for naked shorters.

The former CEO of Universal Express was sentenced to prison for securities fraud in 2014, by the way.

https://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/news/2014/05/06/ex-universal-express-ceo-altomate-prison-sentence.html

I also found the fantastic article below. I'm not sure when it was written (I think around 2010), but it details this sort of thing happening since the 1990s. I particularly like this quote: ""many fall prey to hysterical hoopla purporting to explain how naked shorting is responsible for the untimely deaths of “tens of thousands” of worthy startup companies, and will even one day cause the collapse of the global economy.""

lc33yg,2021-02-04 00:44:23,Losses and Bagholding on Robinhood: A Retrospective,"Strange memories on this nervous night on Robinhood. Two weeks later? Three? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era—the kind of peak that never comes again. Wall Street Bets in the middle of January was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of loss porn or memes or 💎 ✋or 🚀 can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and YOLOing in that corner of your wife's boyfriend's basement. Whatever it meant. . . .

Tendies are hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of “tendies” it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of all the autists and retards comes to a head in a long fine short squeeze, for memes that nobody really understands at the time—and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.

My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty threads—or very early mornings shitposts—when I checked WSB half-crazy and, instead of cashing out, aimed the big $1650 Robinhood account towards GameStop at $325 per share, wearing cummed-stained shorts and a ramen-stained shirt. . .chucking rent money into AMC at $16 per share, not quite sure what my exit strategy was (always stalling at the sell button, too autistic to take profits while I fumbled for more YOLO money) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I traded I would come to a place where people were just as retarded and 💎 ✋ed as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .

There was madness in any stonk, at any hour. If not across GME, then in AMC or BB or NOK. . . . You could strike tendies anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .

And that, I think, was the handle—that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Boomers and Hedge Funds. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn’t need that. Our autism would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting—on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of GameStop, a high and beautiful wave. . . .

So now, less than a week later, you can go up a steep chart on Robinhood and scroll back, and with the right kind of autism you can almost see the high-water price—that place at $500 per share where the wave finally broke and rolled back.",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc33yg/losses_and_bagholding_on_robinhood_a_retrospective/,wallstreetbets

1bxyp75,2024-04-07 07:39:42,RIVN is undervalued and it's LEAPS aren't priced in,"Due to my unextensive research I believe that RIVN is going to absolutely print in the long run. After IPO, the stock immediatly tanked, with most investors believing that the stock was overvalued. Common reasons for this were that the company is still largely in the investment stage, and despite having a product in the hands of consumers, is still not profitable. With a net income of -5.4b in 2023, the company definetly still has a long way to go, no doubt about it, and most investors rightfully decided to leave the stock alone.  


That being said, the value of the company should not be determined by its current value, but by its potential. It is an ""investment"" after all. With the highest customer satisfaction in the industry, a new line of vehicles, and EVs taking over, this sentiment will surely change. Most people acknowledge that Rivian will almost certainly take a huge market share in the future, but because that is such a distant prospect, and because the stock's lifetime graph is so pathetic, I beleive that Rivian's price is not only the lowest it will probably ever be (not specifically *now,* but in general. I don't see it ever sitting in the tens after 2030), but that Rivian's potential to breach its IPO within the next few years is not priced in at all.  


In short, Rivian's stock value and options pricing are a response to aggressive short term trading and panic, and not indicitive of long term investment. This is the dip.  


It would be absolutely unrealistic to assume that RIVN will breach it's IPO price within the next 2 years, but it will very likely double as R2 and R3 roll out. 5-8 years I am very optimistically bullish. and believe that it can break it's IPO. Deep ITM and OTM 2yr LEAPS can't go tits up, and the OTM LEAPS can always be rolled into new OTM LEAPS every 6 months to avoid theta decay.

EDIT Jun 26:

So VW just gave Rivian 5 billion. Stock goin up fr. Here's the kicker: I never had the chance to actually buy the LEAPS I was so vocal about because I was busy moving from one state to another. I'm closing on an apartment THIS WEEK and I was gonna dump my money into RIVN once I'd done that.. rip.

Hopefully some of yall are makin big gains on this stock tho, lmk",17,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxyp75/rivn_is_undervalued_and_its_leaps_arent_priced_in/,wallstreetbets

$RIDE 🚨 Lordstown is well position with minimal high-cost of maintenance parts. Gear boxes and other parts that will need to be maintained on other EV Trucks will allow the Endurance to be hands-down the lowest cost vehicle. In addition, the ability to move quicker than the Big 3 positions us well and early in the market.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/dth5em1qc0671.gif

✅ Rich Schmidt, Lordstown President confirms, Lordstown is fully funded through May 2022 with millions extra in the bank. There is additional fundraising happening to ramp up production, because hard tooling requires 50-51 week advanced and paid order before required. In order to continue to improve production with hard tooling, we will continue to work with ATVM Loan funding and asset-backed funding.

✅ Current interest is at an expected 20,000 non-binding orders through May 2022.

✅ The hub motors have been fully tested on street driving, and we have not been able to break a hub motor. You will break a wheel before you break a hub motor. They are built very much for difficult road conditions.

✅ 600 employees are hired on to support operations across Lordstown locations.

✅ Received FMVSS Penetration Requirements exceeded. Final certification test will be early fourth quarter. Vehicles will be produced in September and quarantined until final certification is released, at which time the vehicles will be delivered to customers.

✅ There is a Lordstown VAN prototype that is in final stages of completion completed, which will be shown this summer. The prototype is set up to use same products, build, and platforms as the Endurance.

✅ The cost for the Endurance will be at $55,000. There is a minimal parts supply cost increase due to covid. The average vehicle increase has been $4,000 across the industry.

✅ Vehicles will be available for press and investors to drive at Lordstown Week, onsite June 21 - 25.

✅ Lordstown will continue an open culture; engaging with the team and it's up to the employees and Lordstown family to seek unionization or not... Every team member owns shares in the company, we enjoy providing free meals, and each day we work hand and hand with all Lordstown employees.

m082zn,2021-03-08 04:47:59,Don't expect GME to become worth more than the combined market cap of all other stocks on the planet,"I totally expect to wake up tomorrow with a negative karma for posting this but man it needs to be said.

The total market cap of all stocks IN THE WORLD combined is about 100 trillion.

It was cute for a bit when everyone was echoing 100k which would put GME at a market cap of 7 trillion. Personally I highly doubt this will happen and will not count on it.

But now the clamor is up to 500k which would be a third of the market cap of the world. Not going to happen.

Soon they will be calling for 1 million which would be 70 trillion almost as much as the market cap of ALL OTHER STOCKS COMBINED and about 40% more than all the stocks in the USA. That will not happen. The HFs won't physically be able to buy shares for that much.

And I don't want to hear how Berskshire A is almost 400k. They only have 1.5 million shares and make a profit of tens of billions of dollars per year. If they had the 70 mil shares that GME has it would be at only 7k.

It is only a matter of time before people are calling for 5 million or 10 million. Don't listen to them. That is nutzzzzzz. 10 mil would put market cap of GME at 700 trillion which is HALF THE NET WORTH OF PLANET EARTH. That is not going to happen. Not possible.

Here is how I see it and nothing here is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor... There s a 99% chance that I get it wrong somehow either to the upside or downside.

1k is likely.

2k is very possible

5k is possible as well but I think a bit of a reach, but it could happen for sure.

10k is a bit of a reach but still possible.

20k not likely

50k very unlikely. It would make GME worth almost double apple.

100k just not going to happen.

500k is a delusion

1 mil is just stupid wishful thinking

suggesting 5 million is going to get people hurt.

If you are counting on 100k expect to be disappointed and expect to walk away with nothing but the shares you hold forever (although I put the long term price of GME at pretty close to where it is now).

If I were to advise anyone anything it is this:

1. have a plan
2. have a plan
3. have a plan

I cannot stress the first 3 enough.

4) don't sell all at once. Most likely you did not buy all at once and the last shares you buy will most likely be the best buy (maybe not by % but by timing)

5) count on: whatever you think in terms of peak $ and peak time will probably be wrong; so plan accordingly

6) be ready to tweak plan if things start to look differently

So for now here is my plan just to give an example but you do you (as Shakespeare wrong, This above all to thine own self be true)

my first sell will probably be around 1k. I will sell probably 100 of my 220 shares (which I might turn around and buy back on a big dip). For my oldest boy's education fund I will sell about 30 of his 100. For my youngest boy sell 10 of his 50.

At 2k I sell 100 more shares keeping 20 and giving me 300k cash which I would be very happy with.

I sell 60 of my oldest boys remaining giving him 10 left and 170k in his account and 10 more years for me to raise it (lets face it 170k would put him through college...).

I sell 35 of my youngest boys giving him 5 left and 80k cash and 14 years to get him enough to go to college.

At 10k I sell all of my boys remaining shares. I sell 25 of my last 30. I hold the last 5 of my shares until I feel we are at the peak or just past the peak.

Also to note once I sell shares and have cash I will be selling puts to make some more cash. I will keep doing this until GME months from now goes back to the 50-60 range and the squeeze is over and a lot of people move on from GME. At some point I will get assigned in that range and pick up probably about 1000 shares for me and a couple of hundred for each of my boys to hold long term. I won't be able to sell puts for my boys until I get their accounts transferred to TD ameritrade.

Majority of the RH haters will prolly be buying puts on $HOOD through their app lmao. 

2) Their UI is fun, feels like a casino &amp; you get a dopamine rush every time you trade, making you want to do it way too often. All the other mainstream brokers I’ve tried have trash mobile UI. 

3) Hood setup well to make boatloads of cash when Uncle Sammy decides to murdered tether &amp; regulate tf outta cryptidiots. No tether expo. RH also not letting ppl withdrawal coins is right in line with how govt wants things to be. 

4) WSB sentiment has historically been an atrocious indicator of future stock performance. 95% of you losers haven’t been around before the GameStop bs, &amp; don’t remember how terrible WSB is at trading generally. Buying $HOOD is effectively shorting WSB in more ways than one which some might consider to be the best trade of all time.

To you, and those around you and online, it seems like the world is failing you. You’ll never own a home, you’ll never retire, and even your car payment and student loans are enough to cripple any hope of having savings. After all, that’s why you gamble on the very system that keeps you perma-broke. 

You and your woke ass Instagram high school classmates (aka Wendy’s coworkers) continually post to your feed statistics of generation wealth inequality, the destruction of the middle class, and whatever else helps you rationalize being a lazy and depressed piece of shit. It’s not you, it’s the system that’s broken!

After a while you might start to think about how this can keep happening. How can so many people be okay with being broke? Well the reality is, it’s probably less than you think. Or at least enough of the poors are too dumb to know any better. 

The reality is, the next golden generation is here and thriving. The baby boomers were known for having the easiest path to retirement in history, but damn gen X is making it look easy too.

Think about it. These losers have essentially no life, high paying jobs, mortgages with all time low interest rates, 401k’s that have rallied harder than Jesus on the third day, and a severe lack of personality or passion, which results in a lust to just be richer than their friends. 

We have a hoard of near retirees who work, spend money, and eat unseasoned chicken with roasted potatoes their whole life. A whole generation of buffets balls deep in the markets, who have rightfully been rewarded for their patience. The kicker is, these idiots won’t even retire as they wouldn’t know what to do with themselves if they did. 

These people are the consumers keeping things afloat, and they aren’t going anywhere. As long as these people are buying new cars every 3 years, going out to eat 5 times a week, going on 2 vacations a year, and buying all the new tech in the world for their 20 something year old degenerate kids, things are going to be just fine. so stop waiting around for a crash that you only think will happen because your poor.

This is poking fun at 2 things: how dramatic people are. The economy ebs and flows. Faster now than ever. Also, how bad things can be for some while seemingly being perfectly fine for others. Also pointing out how I am noticing that the same people who have said this shit for decades are now also finally reaping the rewards of patience and opportunity, leaving them happy and well off, despite all the “unprecedented times” we have had.

If we see 11.9m users drop to say 8m in the coming weeks, we'll know why.

I had made my intentions to sell pretty clear and this worked out well.

I plan to continue short-selling GME where my indicators tell me this is the right move, and will be happy to buy too when (and if) this trends reverts. I'm 100% intra-day, I couldn't handle the stresses of keeping open positions for months. My philosophy: close profitable trades quick and move on - consolidate your profits each time and your portfolio continues to grow.

But maybe after we hit 420, 888, 1K, 5K, 10K a share, some autists may want to cash out a few of those tendies to spend on a selfless cause. 

Can we find a way to work out a transparent way—to match buyers and sellers—who want to tell us how the money may be used to help a loved one, pay of debt, or give back in a different way. 

This approach could help soften the impact of short sellers looking to cascade in the market, plus let people know that this community is about way more than “just the money”

Just an idea, happy to hear what people think.

Then in 2022, he decided to buy out Twitter which hurt investors quite a bit. Dude even said fuk off to Bob Iger. Started beef with Apple, Bill Gates, and JP Morgan. He said if the result of free speech is losing money then be it.

This dude doesn't give an F about investors for reasons listed above.

Now, today, he changed his tone. He said ""if Tesla executes extremely well over the next 5 years, the long-term value could exceed Apple and Aramco combined"". Sound like he begging people to buy Tesla now. Why tf did he suddenly make these bullish comments about the stocks lmao?

Looking at the price action, Tesla is getting shorted almost every day, and investors are losing interest. But from his statement, it sounds like he wants us to hold the bags for 5 years. But his comments was very precise, which can be hard to sue if that doesn't happen.

But the last time he sound bullish like this, he dumped a bunch of shares of his followers lmao. This dude can't be trusted. I would love to be bullish on Tesla if Elon just stfu, and not making any political comments and get alone with everyone.

What do you guys think? Is it bullish or bearish?

DO NOT SELL GME. 

My good friend is a financial banker at a very big hedge fund (can't reveal the name for security reasons of course) and I was able to secretly record him breaking down the hedge fund trading algorithm (spoiler: there are factorials and exponentials involved! very complex math) and I KID you not, at the heart of the whole equation was GME.

At first I didn't even understand how the hell that even makes sense, but this goddamn whistleblower explained it perfectly the farther into the video you go. GME is a HOT buy at an amazing discount and this is coming from someone on the inside.

Super helpful in this video how he explains why GME is a great stock using simple geometry. Keep in mind, taking factorials and converting them to geometric sequences isn't something just any man can do. This involves critical thinking and machine learning.

oq4q1q,2021-07-23 15:27:20,Fasten your seatbelts. Massive market crash is incoming next week and it’s going to be worse than the 2008 housing crash! 📉💥,"Now that I got your attention, I’m thinking there is going to be a (possibly major) correction mid-way next week.

**FA:**

FOMC meeting is on July 28 and they will be, yet again, discussing fiscal and monetary policies. Fed funds rate could remain at <=0.25% or bump up. The rise in fed fund rate is pretty unlikely as JPow communicated that QE slowdown will precede interest rate hikes, but there's a good chance that tapering will be further discussed. US exports have climbed back to precovid numbers, US imports are higher than ever before despite DXY getting slapped meanwhile the GDP target has risen for 2021 signaling a sooner than anticipated economic recovery. Not to mention the continuous MoM CPI climbs in absurd amounts and the US operating at a massive trade deficit, all signal that tapering may start in the very near term despite JPow repeating how far we are from the economic target. However, officials have echoed on numerous fronts, the interest rate is not expected to see a hike until 2023; although, they predict that tapering plans will be announced in Fall of this year, but with everything seeming to go back to status quo sooner than expected, tapering or other bearish monetary policies could be announced and implemented shortly.

Tech earnings week is fast approaching. It’s unlikely the prices will hold when tech stocks sit at all time highs and the ER forecast for blue chips remain stagnant compared to its previous quarters.

**TA:**

TA says we’re reaching upper level resistance. Volatility is extremely high on the upside and can trigger HFT or quant funds to reduce inventory. We can expect higher levels of volatility (VIX futures that is only 1 week dte trading at roughly 20% from current levels).

[Reaching critical trend line resistance. Consider QQQ to have a upside of +1&#37; from here at $370\~$371](https://preview.redd.it/2pp016pjbzc71.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=3248a4a2286ac3add6b4a7351682104e2ff5a773)

EWT says we’re reaching the massive correction cycle. It's the same shit when it comes to tech earnings run-up followed by the dump in spite of a decent performance.

Uncertainty creates risk and risk drives fear so the fact that ER release (granted a beat) by the blue chips might not be large enough to justify current prices, or the possible sector rotation that may ensue post ER release, or the possible tapering discussion which may change the macro, or reaching the upper level resistance of a major trend line could scare smart money away from the equity market in the near term. Call it quad witching if you will.

15bitm7,2023-07-28 00:49:24,$DISH is extremely undervalued,"So I got into $DISH because of the Dish guy on here a few days ago, but before buying into it, I wanted to make sure it was a good company and I wasn't buying into trash. 

I've bought into FRC, AMC, WISH, SOS, TLRY, RAD and many other meme stocks here, so it's fair to say I'm regarded and I've made and lost a lot of money on my stupid plays but I have told myself I am done playing stupid and I need to invest in better companies. 

So despite the news of Dish selling phone plans on Amazon, I looked at their balance sheet, and I feel this is one of the most undervalued companies on the market. 

Because many regards here don't look at the balance sheet, let's take a close look. 

As of last quarter they have

Cash on hand: $2.54B

Total long term debt: $20.53B

Total liabilities: $35.38B

Total assets $56.562B

Total Shareholder Equity: $18.183B (AFTER debt)

Current market cap: $3.72B

In the last year, they've made over 5 billion in profit, as a failing company, their total profit is less than the market cap of the company. How often do you find a company that has made over 5 billion, offers over 18B in book value, trading for under 4 billion? it's a steal.

A lot of that debt has been added over the last few years as they've built out their 5G network to compete with other providers along with purchasing Boost Mobile from Sprint for $1.4 billion.

As you can see even with what customer base is left after all the cord cutting, and now with the new Amazon deal, they are still a very profitable company. They are trading as if they are going to spiral into bankruptcy, but as of right now unless something changes, they are a profitable company that is able to pay all its debts, on top of that, even if shareholder equity was only $10 billion, it's still trading at 3 times less than it should be, the book value as of right now is over 18 billion, yet it's trading at 3.72B, it's a steal. 

I also believe that this is a trial period of Amazon selling their Sim cards and cell phone services through their website, if Amazon sees that they are selling well and doing well through Amazon, I believe Dish will have a good chance of being acquired by Amazon, but I believe Amazon wants to see how well they do first before taking that leap, but even if they do, Amazon would be buying a profitable company, that they could integrate into their own services with Prime Video and a 5G network already built out as most of the leg work has already been done.

Even if Amazon never acquires them and that isn't the play (which I totally believe will happen eventually) the big play here is this, they are still a very profitable company, they realize that they are losing customers at a rapid pace on their Dish network services and they've noticed it for a while, so now they are trying to transition to a cell phone provider while they still are making money from their satellite company to roll this transition out.

Lastly, I do expect a decent earnings here as their last earnings was a disaster with over 552,000 people that left due to a cyberattack that left their entire network down for a week, I believe there will be some decline in the satellite division, but I also expect them to push their new cell phone and 5G net work as the future of the company, as even if they were to sell the network they built out alone with 5G, it would be worth more than the debt and 3.72B market cap this is currently trading at. I believe people will finally see the value that they are bringing to the table and the stock will jump to the $10-12 range. 

The IV is also higher on the call side than put side, and it's been that way for a bit, so I think even the hedge funds know this is undervalued and expect it to go higher. 

I could be wrong, so do your own DD. I'm holding through earnings and jumping ship if I am wrong. 

Position 7,400 shares - yes I'm a bag holder but my DD stands, and I know when to cut my losses, so troll me if you want lol

tl:dr - Dish Network is undervalued, they are transitioning into a new industry and already built a lot of the 5G network out to over 240 million Americans (70% of the population) that alone would be worth it for Amazon or some other big player to purchase off of them. The company isn't going bankrupt, but they're being priced as they are.

tc30wh,2022-03-11 23:24:48,"The DRS/direct registration/switch from street name to record name ""movement"" is a bonafide Reddit Moment.","I am a corporate lawyer. I represent public companies. I have watched from the side lines as you all have talked for the last year or so about how revolutionary you are being by demanding the transfer agents of the companies in which you own stock move your shares from the street names of your brokers to your own registered names at AST, ComputerShare, EQ (pre-merger) etc. Here is an example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb1b6w/checkmate\_wall\_street/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb1b6w/checkmate_wall_street/) 

My impression has been, wow, these people really have no idea how absolutely insignificant this move is to the brokers weighed against the negative effects it is likely to have on their companies, whose expenses for administering this increased number of registered SHs are going to go up substantially.

Now I'm starting to see the rubber meet the road. This week I saw the first invoices from Broadridge for annual meeting services this year, which are up 35-65% for  my clients because their registered shareholder pool has gone up by, depending on the client, hundreds/thousands of individuals/entities because of your ""movement."" I guess you don't realize that for every new registered shareholder, the company has to pay like $1,000 extra each year to Broadridge for searches, report tabulation, voting, mailing proxy statements and cards, mailing annual reports, etc. not to mention many issuers are now exceeding the limits of the transfer agent contracts so they are paying per SH out the ass to AST/Computershare. I am seeing company's annual meeting bills and transfer agent quarterly invoices go up by $100,000s for absolutely no reason. I can only imagine how crazy the transfer agent/Broadridge bills are this year for a true meme stock like GME; I assume at least $1 million.

I really have no skin in this game other than the solvency of my clients so they can pay my invoices and I don't really care either way really except I think it's funny to point out that by taking this untutored stance against your brokers who, trust me, don't give a shit whether your 23 GME shares are on their books or AST's, you are actually costing the companies you are trying to long literally hundreds of thousands of dollars for basically no reason (not to mentioned the poor beleagured stock administration teams at your portfolio companies who are like, ""wait, what someone wants to hold 7 shares at AST, that's like 20 minutes of paperwork I didn't need or want to add to my plate"").

In other words, you played yourself.

Stop living in denial for two fucking seconds and listen. The ONLY reason GME got as high as it did was because of the media. It was portrayed as a “David vs Goliath” story which started a buying frenzy that everyone wanted to be a part of. I know you dipshits don’t understand how the stock market works but I’m sure you can understand simple supply and demand. 

Look at the chart. You can literally see the day it became national news, and like most things, it was viral for a few days followed by NO ONE GIVING A SHIT EVER AGAIN.

So that’s it. Here we are with GME back to reasonable volume, backpedaling it’s way to a more reasonable value. If you have shares you have two choices, hold because you think the return from this point will be stronger than other investments, or sell because you think it won’t. What you paid for the shares has absolutely nothing to do with it. “Diamond hands” isn’t a admirable ballsy move it’s idiot speak for “I’m too scared and dumb to determine if I was wrong and need to move on”.

If you do hold, you need to realize it will be a while. You need to stop constantly checking the price, stop telling yourself you will wake up tomorrow and see it at +100%, stop coming on here looking to confirm your beliefs. Find something else to do to occupy your time before you lose your mind.

But lately I’ve noticed this sub only talks about GME. Will it ever stop? 

Let’s face it, GME isn’t going to the moon anytime soon. The short sellers and market makers can replicate as many share IOUs as they want to keep up with any retail buyer demand. And since the stock isn’t paying dividends, and the company’s revenue is going down the toilet, there’s really no big downside to them doing so. Maybe Ryan Cohen could turn around the company someday, but that could take years.

Anyways I’d like to see this sub return to its roots. Ban all the newcomers especially people who only talk about GME. Anyone else agree? There’s more stocks to invest in than GME, many of them more promising and with higher upside.

kil4wu,2020-12-23 03:31:07,GME short squeeze is a myth that assumes massive incompetence from people that actually know what they are doing.,"So with GME running the myth of the inevitable short squeeze has popped up again.  In order for this to happen a ton of people need to short the stock naked.  Which among competent investors is really fucking rare.  I will walk through it below but you can also click this link:

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp

For example let’s assume you wanted to short GME today at $20 a share.  So you sell 100 shares short at $20 each.  With a naked short you have unlimited losses as the stock runs up.  Nobody who knows what the fuck they are doing is going to do that when you can hedge to cap that loss.  A single January 21 call at a strike of 21 had a high of 2.42 today would hedge that just fine.

You short the shares and buy the call.  Your break even is now 17.68 on your short but your max loss is now $342 without borrowing costs assuming it closes at $20.99 on expiry.  Call expiring worthless for loss of $242 and $99 to cover the short.  

Borrowing costs on 100 shares at 20% and stock at 20 is about $1 a day.  Assuming everything is held to expiry with the January expiry would be about $25.

So max loss regardless of how high the stock goes is less than $400.

Your break even is kind of ass but that’s because you are protected until mid Jan.  However if IV is particularly high, even if the stock goes down pushing your return on the short up, the call might still retain enough value that your break even is much higher.  

If it’s a short term play which a short on today would likely be, you could buy a call for Friday which had a high of 1.15 today which puts your break even at 18.85 assuming you hold until Friday at close.  Factoring in borrowing cost it’s 18.8.  

That’s a hedged short which likely the vast , vast majority of GME shorts are.  Have you not noticed how fucking expensive relatively speaking call options are even with the spikes. A 20c at close with 1.5 days to expiry had a break even at 20.72 with a volume of 30,000.  Now part of that is people buying lottos but a ton of that is covering shorts.

So the whole premise of there are millions of shares that are short at $5 or $7 is some serious bullshit.  Yes there were 70m shares short give or take 2m at the end of October and there were the same number of shares short at the end of November.  This does not mean they are the same fucking people shorting it. Some have covered, some executed hedges and others have sold that shit short at higher prices.

For example today alone 8m shares were shorted.

https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme

Yesterday there were 3m shares shorted.  Borrowing rates are in the 20% range, which works out to around $1 total per 100 shares.  Or a single fucking tick downward.  So no institutions aren’t going to be covering shares they shorted at $15 when it spikes to $19.

But why has it been spiking if it’s not a short squeeze, and that’s really fucking simple, a ton of people are playing the momentum on it.  Hell 10% of the daily thread is people spamming to buy shares and you can make some money provided you don’t buy the top.  Its not a coincidence that they announce the stimulus and the stock spiked and I would be willing to bet that the vast majority of shares bought today were through Robinhood.

But Cohen you say?  He added another 3%, yeah he added 3% directly on the dip after earnings.  He’s in at $12 - $13 range based off the timings of the 13d.  If you are wondering what happens if he decides that the board isn’t being accommodating enough and drops his shares look at what happened the day Buffet said he was dropping airlines.  He can eat the ride down to $13 and still be profitable.

Then finally the biggest piece to the short squeeze is long term positive catalysts, the last significant short squeeze came from ACB two earnings ago when they closed the gap on their loss and cancelled their at the money offering.  At that point the long term growth story fundamentally changed as did the state of the business.  That’s what it takes to force a short squeeze, doubling e-commerce sales when overall sales are still massively down isn’t going to cut it.  A slightly green quarter during the launch of multiple new consoles isn’t going to do it either.  Now if they follow that with another solidly profitable quarter in May, at that point a squeeze is possible.


TL:DR:  The infinite short squeeze on GameStop is a bullshit argument assuming basic competence from anyone shorting the stock.  Options were in fact originally designed to offset the risks of shorting.  It will go up as long as more people are willing to become bagholders, just don’t be shocked when it comes crashing down.  It also explains the crazy ass high IV on call options.",0,0.41,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kil4wu/gme_short_squeeze_is_a_myth_that_assumes_massive/,wallstreetbets

I work in small molecule drug development, trying to find new drugs for new biology to treat old diseases. It's far worse than a search for a needle in a haystack. More like a molecule of water in an ocean. Most drug companies will start by screening millions and millions of molecules followed by an intensive drug optimization campaign to mitigate liabilities like hepato- and renal-tox, ion channel inhibition, protein binding, bioavailability, etc. You often wind up (after spending ~$50 million dollars) with thousands of different chemicals from which you are lucky to get one. If you want a good example of what a very successful drug looks like, here's Lipitor:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atorvastatin

Meanwhile, Cassava did none of that. If you look at their original patents from the early 2000s, they were looking for something that would work in the opioid pathway. They screened nothing, and somehow magicked simufilam out of thin air. There was no optimization, no intensive toxicology screening. No orthogonal binding assays. There is no x-ray crystal structure of where it binds. All of this to say - they have nothing. None of the data that even a first year graduate student would ask about. Just look at the molecule!
 https://www.medchemexpress.com/simufilam.html
It's a greasy little turd with more chemical liabilities than you could shake a stick at. The mere idea that this could have a pM affinity is laughable when the most potent drugs on the market are 1000 times less potent. 
Anyone with a year of medicinal chemistry experience is laughing at the suckers buying this stock.

Now back to that 6%. Since the OP of the post I'm referencing is obviously very ignorant to the profession they are attempting to condemn, let me shine some light on how this shit works. No Realtor ever sees that full 6%. Ever.

Let me try to smooth-brain this for you: When you list your home with a Realtor and agree to pay the 6% commission, once that house sells that 6% gets split 4 ways. Yup. 4 ways. 3% gets SPLIT between the listing brokerage and the agent who actually listed the home (how did you think brokerages make money and stay open..?) and the other 3% gets SPLIT between the buyer's agent and that agent's brokerage. Since most of these splits are commonly 50/50 (there are certainly areas of our nation where the split is even less favorable to the agent), the agent who you're trying to bitch about getting 6% is actually getting roughly 1.5% once all the money is divided up.

So to sum this up, when you pay 6% on the sale of your home, your money is not going to one person's pocket and making them mega-rich like everyone apparently thinks. Your money is helping to keep 2 separate businesses running and also helping two individuals pay their bills.

And don't even get me started about the monopoly Zillow is attempting to run so they can control the prices of our housing market nationwide. Zillow (who owns Trulia, DotLoop,  HotPads,  Buyfolio,  ShowingTime, Postlets,  Diverse Solutions, RentJuice,  Mortech, StreetEasy,  Retsly, Naked Apartments,  & Bridge Interactive) is a growing cancer attempting to not only oust Realtors, but Mortgage Lenders and Property Managers as well nationwide.

Stop being so ignorant about this profession before your blind ignorance comes back to haunt you.

And thank a Realtor the next time you see one.

EDIT: No one is making you use a Realtor at the end of the day, so for those of you who feel they aren't worth a damn, just don't use one. But I made this post in defense of Realtors from being bashed and misunderstood as people who take all your money and do nothing since everyone seems to think they pocket the full 6%. That is a lie. Anyone is free to list their house on their own, and of course you're free to use Zillow or any other platform to assist you, just keep in mind this silver lining:  When you choose to use Zillow, they aren't legally bound to provide you accurate information. They have disclaimers galore that keep them from being responsible when you make a stupid decision based on the info they provide. A Realtor has skin in the game; they are legally bound to provide nothing but accurate info and if they don't they can be sued. But go ahead, give up your right to have someone assist you that has skin in the game and go for the companies that could give a shit less if you just made the biggest financial mistake of your life off inaccurate info they provided you.

EDIT 2: I am not a Realtor. I did obtain my license for my own personal gain, but I hate people too much to do what Realtors do daily.",0,0.46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oma9s6/in_response_to_the_idiot_who_decided_to_make_a/,wallstreetbets

Ok, so commodities were going up in price due to excess demand and limited supply. But now the global recovery will be slowed due to Omicron. European and Asian countries are already going into lockdown, and banning travel to/from the UK.

With some European countries, like the Netherlands, implementing strict only essentials stores may be open. (I hope we don't bring back the term essential workers). 
The scheduled closure of various facilities are:

- Schools until Jan 9.
- Bars, restaurants, gyms, hairdressers until Jan. 14th
- Wider measures until Jan. 22

I'm sure you're all aware of that Joe Manchin torpedoed the $2T BBB (Build back Better) plan. This could be bullish and decrease aggregate demand. I don't blame him, for saying no, they added too much pork.


Since, the bond yields have gone down, and oil prices have fallen as well. I think this is risk ON!

1906fy6,2024-01-06 18:27:33,The housing market is finally going to dump soon.,"Yes, I know. Everyone's been claiming it, for over a year now. Really, there are always permabears saying it's going to finally correct or crash or whatever, and the Big Short has not helped things as now everyone wants to be a Michael Burry and call a new top. I've been a small time RE investor for a bit now, physical property not stock. So I've always got my ear to the state of RE value and trends, and I'm generally bullish on it as it is a protected asset class that the state insists on propping up and becomes generally more scarce due to regulatory creep. But for the time being, I think the dump is finally coming within the next half-year.

1. For once, the Fed is actually working against the housing market. They quite literally are trying to induce some kind of correction by yanking up interest rates to their highest levels in 25+ years. So there are no smoke and mirrors financing policies that can toss them a lifeboat right now.
2. As many have heard, the effective monthly mortgage payment is basically at its highest point ever, by a huge margin. The cost to own has surged past the cost to rent. We're talking 50+% in under a year for the same priced home, and as home values rocketed during COVID QE there is now nowhere to go but down in order to meet demand.
3. Demand has been frozen, this is known by all in the industry. While values have only flatlined the industry itself (RE agents, mortgage personnel) are in recession as transactions are simply not happening. So why have values only treaded water rather than dumping?
4. Supply has simply not been there. Historically low supply. Literally just not enough houses to cause any sort of market panic or crash. People still need to buy homes to live in, and for the time being sellers have found a buyer for their price, eventually, just not as quickly as 2021-2022.

With all of these factors in mind, consider a few things just happened:

Home values have double topped and are on the downswing [https://ycharts.com/indicators/us\_existing\_home\_median\_sales\_price](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_existing_home_median_sales_price)

and more critically:

[US housing supply is finally soaring back to levels unseen since the great housing crash of 2007](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSACSR)

Frozen demand is finally starting to meet a glut of supply, and mortgage rates have remained largely unchanged, still the most expensive time to buy a house in American history. Commercial RE has already been in hell and a foreclosure crunch is expected. Probabilities markets predict that the Fed will be cutting rates within the next half-year, where they accurately assessed the rate hikes prior. This means the expectation from people with actual money (not idiotic talking heads with no stakes), is that a recession and dovish pivot is on the agenda next.

I'm personally betting on at least a small housing crash this year and loading up on some puts to hedge my portfolio. Feel free to call me stupid :-)",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1906fy6/the_housing_market_is_finally_going_to_dump_soon/,wallstreetbets

137xdvm,2023-05-04 19:32:02,How dumb are some of y’all?,"Im only talking about the handful of y’all that are hoping for more bank failures.  Why are y’all hoping more banks fail?  First of all, if the banks all end up failing, the government can easily say, “Well I guess CBDC’s are our only option.”  Do y’all really want that?

Another thing is that people actually work for these banks.  When you are rooting for a bank to fail, you’re not just rooting for the top executives to lose their jobs but also countless customer service reps, tellers, branch managers, IT employees, janitors, and other people to lose their jobs.  You’re also rooting for people to lose their money that they have invested in these banks.  

You may not realize it, but you probably have money invested in these banks.  Vanguard, Schwab, iShares, Fidelity, and other companies have some of these regional banks in different ETF’s.  Also, a significant chunk of bank stocks make up at least 16% of the Russel 2000 (the S&P has a significantly lower percentage).  If banks keep failing, it is going to end up costing the FDIC a lot of money and guess where that money comes from?  Either more taxes (they say it will only be banks affected, yeah right) or by printing more money.

pa33xi,2021-08-23 16:15:52,The Great Unwinding: Why Cash Is Still King and Boomers Will (Once Again) Steal Your Wealth,"Time for some hot bear smut, but this isn’t your usual flavor of doom and gloom. Also, I’ll try to not sound like “David” in the following.

You. You are an individual. As an individual, you are a basic economic unit. As a basic economic unit, you are responsible for contributing economic activity, managing your personal resources, and maximizing utility. Utility means two things in being a productive member of society AND by being content with your lifestyle. This has been studied for generations and is taught as personal finance or even home economics.

As an individual or a family, it is in your best interest to ensure you have adequate liquidity. This liquidity will allow you to meet your short term financial obligations and even your long term financial obligations. Most people talk about an emergency find which should be 6 months to 1 year of your complete living expenses. For most adults in the U.S. this figure is a minimum of $30,000 per individual in cash, either physical or in a checking account that can be quickly accessed. Most of you probably do not have these resources available. If you do not, then you should immediately stop gambling and save every red cent.

At the time of this writing, the total value of the US stock market was approximately 100 Trillion USD...maybe more. However, the total circulating supply of USD in the world was approximately 20.4 Trillion USD. That means that 80% of the total stock market value is illusory and nonexistent. This is why during 2008 and 2020 there was such a run on financial markets. Everyone was cashing in to get raw cash! The problem then, and the problem now, is that there isn’t enough money to go around. When the next market meltdown happens, it will be far more pronounced as everyone tries to convert their funny money assets into real money. This is one of the reasons why there is such a growing disparity between the rich and the poor. The poor give their money to the rich and then wonder why they are poor. 

Anyway, everyone knows that stock prices are super overvalued, bond prices are super overvalued, real estate is super overvalued. The only thing that is not yet overvalued, is USD.

https://preview.redd.it/a5bx2k3qr4j71.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=dad697253b5a9eba7a28172cc27600faf853dbcd

If you are less than 30 years old, you do not get to have an opinion on inflation or the value of the USD. You simply have not lived enough to know what the fuck you’re talking about. Period. All of the “precious” metal bugs are getting their shit pushed in by JPow’s green dildo. There is inflation, but it’s in every asset class from bond prices, stonk prices, and real estate prices…not in cash. Cash is the only thing with intrinsic value because that is what we all use as a medium of exchange. It’s also what each and every one of us care about at the end of the day. Period. Every other asset is only made up of extrinsic value nowadays which is why meme stocks have been in the the driver seat. Finally, the only way the USD will stop being of any value is if the United States collapses. If that happens, you will have bigger personal issues to deal with than literally ALL of your assets going to 0. Moving on.

Boomers hold most of the wealth in the United States. They also have most of their wealth tied up in the stock market and real estate market. Most boomers will be retiring en masse and as they do retire, they will be converting their mutual funds and stocks into cold hard cash. This will have a ripple effect that will make equity prices go down. While you’re stuffing real money into the slot machines of the stock market casino, boomers are gleefully taking that money from you and putting it in their pockets. The boomers didn’t take your money…you gave it to them. Further, as they begin retiring, and they have already begun, they will keep taking your money as they sell their shares to you.

Also, look at the velocity of money. The velocity of money has been in decline since the GFC and has dropped from 10.6 in 2008 all the way down to 1.18 in 2021. Shit is going to get crazy as the real economy is still fucked and there will be a reckoning soon. Soon means anywhere from a few weeks to a few years. Nobody has a crystal ball but anyone that looks around can see it. Make no mistake, it IS coming. Make sure you are properly positioned so you don’t get fucking rekt when it does. You recently saw how the market sold off over 1% last week at just the hint of the Fed talking about thinking about tapering asset purchases. That doesn’t even address the fed funds rate. Interest rates will have to go up soon. When they do, even by .25%, it will make EVERYTHING lose value. Burry was right when he called this the greatest speculative bubble of all time and that the market is dancing on a knife’s edge. Do not let yourself get fucked by the idiocy of those in power.

IDGAF what you think about this, because at the end of the day, YOU and YOU ALONE have to live with yourself and your personal circumstances. It’s no skin off my ass if I see you on a street corner begging for change. I’ve already met some of you who’ve YOLO’d it all right into homelessness. I warned you. If this saves one idiot from gambling their live savings away on this negative sum game, then that is enough for me.

https://preview.redd.it/cenmhgatt4j71.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=66a1ab0ead88b290b06c5a9409084701a6a17b06

Takeaways: sell all your shit now and convert it all into USD. Hold it in money market funds or your checking account. As long as you have quick access to it for use in your personal life. If you have dependents, then get the fuck off of WSB and get your family financially prepared. I’ve seen too many deadbeat dads on here who have financially ruined their families. Don’t be that guy. If you’re single, then make sure you don’t have to move back in with mom n’ dad. Take care of your shit.

Also, make sure your career is stable and unfuck yourself if you’re on a PIP or something. Find a new job because right now wages and salaries are higher and it’s a bull market for job seekers. Start a business or a side hustle, with bonus points if it targets boomers and their wealth.

Positions: 90% USD and 10% in brokerage account to gamble on OTM options. Most I can ever lose is 10% of my wealth. 

TLDR: Cash out your retirement, cash out your stonks, bonds, and everything. DUMP IT before Boomers do it first. Cash is still king and you will need the liquidity to personally weather the storm during the coming crisis. Only gamble 10% of your total net worth in risky stonks or options at any given time. DO NOT YOLO. Gambling on the stock market is fine as long as you’re using money that you can literally afford to lose. e.g. no more than 10% of your net worth at any given point\*.

\*Don’t use the 10% rule as an excuse to chop yourself up into bits before ending up broke. This means if you’re only worth $10,000 then the most you can gamble is $1,000. If you lose it, then you’re done until you save another $1,000 to then gamble. It does not mean lose $1,000, then take 10% of $9,000. Again, this is all on you. If you fuck yourself then you have to live with it, not me.",55,0.56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pa33xi/the_great_unwinding_why_cash_is_still_king_and/,wallstreetbets

* ARM runs on your Television
* ARM runs on smart watches
* GPU's that need compute and cuda core busing runs on ARM
* Microsoft runs on ARM
* Google runs on ARM
* AWS Graviton runs on ARM

ARM is the silicon designer for anyone who wants a custom designed chip for their hardware use case.

Forget everything you knew about ARM pricing and EPS based on historical records. The new new pricing royalties and actual collection of profits from new and innovative design will come into their revenues.

They don't make hardware, instead they will design and get a cut from almost every device you can think of.

The AI boom stands to benefit them in new ways as AI devices that will require low power and less/no heat to run will be a vital aspect of all devices coming into the future.

Yes Intell is a competitor but like most intel products that have come out they are slow to move and come out with inferior products. Look at their GPU lineup (why did they even do anything if you were going to do something so benign).

RISCV is a competitor that is arguing open source but let's get real here. They are requiring royalties too and the IP now stands with ARM and will increasingly stand with ARM.

Is ARM a trillion dollar company in 10 years? I say yes, easily. Mark my words.

They will continue delivering custom chips more and more and more and they will be mostly, if not all, through the ARM and NPU chipset designs.

The future is bright for ARM. Get in on the ground floor now.

What makes ARM so amazing? Compute power per watt and heat transfer. It's why your new Macbooks don't have full blowing old school fans that are running to cool down your pc every 2 minutes. The fan is not even directly on the chip die. Microsoft will soon release all of their Surface lineup on ARM going forward. Mark my words. They have to compete with Apple and Apple is ahead on this. Increasingly, all of Azure data centers will increasingly run on ARM because it's cheaper and more cost effective.

It's compute that is specific for the actual use case. Not the x86 legacy use case of trying to run on and do everything. It's(x86) is not power efficient and power efficiency is ultra important to hardware processes rather than trying to have a chip that does everything but only needs to do 1 or 2 things.

ARM specializes in designing microprocessors, SoC (System on Chip) solutions, and related technologies. They develop the architecture and designs for various types of processors, including those used in smartphones, tablets, embedded systems, and increasingly in servers and desktops.

There's a lot of hate for the Reddit IPO and people predicting its inevitable demise. These people are wrong. Most of this comes from people just not wanting change - because lets face it, we're all on Reddit, and it's basically the last refuge on the internet for some of the 'oldschool internet' crowd.

Now lets look at some of the other social media networks out there. What do you think is the average age of the typical SNAP / INSTA / TIKTOK user compared to Reddit? Now look at their valuations. SNAP is 20BB. Meta is 1.2T. Reddit's IPO is being priced at 5.XB.

Now lets think about Reddit's product - which is the users. We, on average, are going to be older, and therefore have a higher net worth, more higher level jobs, etc. As an advertising audience, we are a much more valuable product compared to the kids sexting on SNAP. If SNAP is worth 20B, Reddit is going to reach at LEAST that level in a year. Yea, unfortunately it means there will probably be more ads, but hopefully they won't fuck it up to the point where the users bail - and lets face it, there isn't really anywhere else for us to go.

So yea, I'm bullish on Reddit. I've got my IPO allocation in. If you had aren't buying at IPO prices, then you belong here with the best regards.",0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bfglam/unpopular_opinion_i_am_bullish_on_reddit_ipo_stock/,wallstreetbets

>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laferl/15_usca_78i_the_illegality_of_short_ladder/





This is the biggest thread about it but any post the mentions a ""short ladder attack"", ""ladder attack"", or ""short attack"" fall into this. ""Short ladder attacks"" and ""ladder attacks"" are NOT real and are not a term you see anywhere other than WSB and a single SeekingAlpha post by a crazy person. Short attacks are real but literally everyone on WSB is using the word incorrectly. It means something completely different from how it's being used.




This is what a short attack is:







>https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/11/27/short-activism-the-rise-in-anonymous-online-short-attacks/











>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp 






Just shorting a stock a lot is NOT a short attack. Actual examples of short attacks are Citron's ""research"" which scares investors into selling their stock. You can even view Bill Ackman's short of Herbalife as an attempted short attack since he was public about it which made investors fearful (temporarily). This has not occurred with GME recently. Obviously Citron was shorting it for a bit but the claims of short attacks have been much more recent than that. None of these claims talk about what was occurring weeks ago with Citron because when they say ""short attack"" they mean something completely different from the actual definition. 





Also, the trading strategy that people talk about when mentioning a ""short ladder attack"" or ""ladder attack"" does NOT even work. Think about for even a second. For this type of price manipulation to happen you need either do it to a stock with almost no volume or you need to trade enough to be responsible for almost all the volume. For the last 2 weeks the lowest daily volume for GME has been 40 million. With many days having a volume double that. So, the first possibility is out. The second possibility assumes that hedge fund are willing to trade BILLIONS of dollars of stock back and forth on a daily basis. That makes 0 sense but let's say that's true just for the argument. The goal of this supposed strategy is to artificially lower the price. Most hedge funds did not short GME and have no reason to allow this strategy to happen. If BILLIONS (or millions) of dollars of the stock are traded at artificially low then the rest of Wall Street would just buy these shares and make a profit. Thus, moving the price back to equilibrium. It is impossible to manipulate a stock price with this strategy if the volume is this big. 






**Number 2: ""GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze""**






>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/








>I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. ~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.








I've already explained what short attacks mean so this is a perfect example of a completely incorrect usage of the word.









~~Also, the site the OP linked shows shares that are available TO BE borrowed. It does not show when shared ARE borrowed. So, it actually shows the opposite of what OP thought it did. Which means his whole argument is incorrect since it depended on this to make any sense.~~





~~I go more in depth about that here:~~
~~https://ns.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/le7syu/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float/gmaru31/~~



**EDIT #4 - 7PM: The second part of my argument is incorrect. I assumed the website worked in a way that it doesn't. I only realized this after tinkering a bunch. If you're interested in exactly why I was confused here's a link to a discussion I had which made me realize my mistake:** 



https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmixka6/






**Number 3: ""Why $GME short interest appears to have fallen when in reality it has not.""**







>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lag1d3/why_gme_short_interest_appears_to_have_fallen/







Short interest does not change when short-sellers hedge with options. Short interest is the number of shares sold short divided by the number of shares outstanding. Buying an options contract does not just change either part of that equation. Short-sellers can hedge with options and lessen/eliminate their losses from their shorts but this does not change short interest at all. The OP has a fundamental misunderstanding of finance. 











**Number 4: ""https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/""**









>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/









Again, an incorrect understanding of short attacks. The SeekingAlpha post linked is a literal conspiracy theory as is the ""CounterfeitingStock"" website. There is a reason why it the ONLY website claiming what it does and does so without any proof. We do not know the author or their background/credentials. The thousands of academics that study markets have never talked about or written a paper about ANYTHING the website or the SeekingAlpha post claim. It was given 0 attention for years until WSB found it and now posts about it every 2 seconds without ever reading the contents of it. It is the equivalent of a 9/11 or JFK conspiracy website.   








Also, the OP claims that malicious naked shorting occurred. There is 0 evidence of this. Nobody that has a background in economics or finance believes this. Just the conspiracy theorists on Reddit. Does it naked shorting occur? I'm sure to some extent it does. Does it occur on a level that has an impact on markets? Nobody has evidence of that and there are a few papers on it. Did it occur here and was it malicious? No reason to believe that it occurred on a large scale or that it was malicious. 












**Number 5: ""How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th, 22nd, or 25th with GME's 69.75 Million Outstanding""**



>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/




Of all the posts I've included this is the only one that has an OP that isn't making blatant mistakes off the bat. Not that there aren't mistakes. But, they're MUCH more forgivable than the others. 








OP's whole argument depends on the FINRA short volume numbers being correct. However, they are not and FINRA even warns for people not to use them to as a proxy for short interest. The numbers include any time a firm decides to sell its own shares so that it can fill a customer's sell order easier. This is relatively common so you can't use these numbers to show actual short positions. This is why the numbers are so off  compared to any third party estimate. I talk more about this problem here : https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/gmfoih1/
























**Number 6: ""GME FLOAT 177%. Apes with the Bloomberg terminal please keep us updated with the numbers.""**












>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leby2i/gme_float_177_apes_with_the_bloomberg_terminal/










So, there's actually not anything directly wrong with the OP since it's just a post of a Bloomberg terminal. The problem is that its obvious that the OP as well as everyone commenting assumes that ""177% of float held"" means the same as ""177% short interest"". This is obviously a very weird mistake to make. It doesn't mean that short interest is 177%. It means that intuitional investors own 177% of float of GameStop. Which is something completely different. Obviously there is a reporting error because institutional investors don't actually own 177% of all outstanding shares. The reasons for this are explained here: 




>https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp#:~:text=There%20are%20instances%20where%20investors,from%20short%20selling%20between%20investors.









**Number 7: ""S3 Partner's ""S3 SI% of Float"" Metric is Total Bullshit and Here's Why""**





>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbydkz/s3_partners_s3_si_of_float_metric_is_total/








I explain why this post and posts like it about S3's data is completely in this post towards the bottom: https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5b8i/updated_short_interest_numbers_for_gamestop_gme/






Basically WSB confused the short interest calculation with S3's own short interest calculation. They have always done both and have always reported both while labeling them correctly. WSB confused the two and thought that S3 had changed the way they were calculating short interest. This never happened. They have always calculated short interest the same way. 






**Number 8: ""It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers""**




>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le4c62/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/




The original post was removed but I've seen it reposted a bunch. If I find one with the original text I'll link it. Anyway, I talk about the mistakes of this post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldgn9a/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/gm66hgf/




**There are plenty more posts that are completely wrong or misinformed. But, I already spent 1-2 hours typing this out so I'm done for now. I'll get on later to answer any questions if any come up.**





TLDR: Almost every single post that makes claims about the markets, data, or GME do not know what they're talking about. These posts have many mistakes and don't ever have an argument that makes logical sense. Do not believe any post on WSB unless you actually did the work and researched everything an OP claims. Including me.









**EDIT #1 - 2:45 PM: Here are is a bit more info on failure-to-delivers and naked shorting:**








>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmhufze/.











>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling









>A study of fails to deliver, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2014, found no evidence that FTDs ""caused price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis"". Researchers studied 1,492 New York Stock Exchange stocks over a 42-month period from 2005 to 2008, and found that ""greater FTDs lead to higher liquidity and pricing efficiency, and their impact is similar to our estimate of delivered short sales.""








To clarify: Naked shorting occurs and causes failure-to-delivers. However, there are many other causes. A high number of FTD's does not mean any illegal naked shorting occurred. The point I'm trying to make is that there is no reason to believe that something shady has occurred with GME in terms of abusive naked shorting.





The FTD's should be investigated just to make sure. But, I don't think a large amount of FTD's is evidence of abuse.

193achg,2024-01-10 15:05:49,PART 2 – The Stock Market Has Generated No Real Returns Over the Last 50 Years,"PART 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/192ik9f/the\_stock\_market\_has\_generated\_no\_real\_returns/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/192ik9f/the_stock_market_has_generated_no_real_returns/)

\---

To recap, the only accounts that have, on average, increased in real terms, as measured by the most common and reliable store of value (gold), are government debt and government deficits. 

The S&P 500 has been flat:

https://preview.redd.it/x55bdmlhlmbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=d14b430484716a868ff61429559b2ecebe2a007c

Middle class wages have steeply declined:

While Government debt and deficits have both increased:

https://preview.redd.it/w4l5j7tjlmbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a85a7aaec64c5061afc9859638ca9caf053b554

https://preview.redd.it/j2lf8mlklmbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8ab061a68a223948967a57d289480f65afd0fba

If any of this was purely the result of fluctuations in gold prices, we would assume all of these charts would look similar. 

They do not. The government is clearly benefiting from something unique. 

The answer: Inflation. Not consumer prices, but \*real\* inflation. 

Here is real inflation:

https://preview.redd.it/sfcu8dgmlmbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc2eace6e4ffd2c1d68d0c9647f2ea75b01d50ba

Here is government-reported inflation (consumer prices):

https://preview.redd.it/b8hvvejnlmbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a77e0882cc521daaa014e422c7d7020a5970205

And here is real inflation compared to government-reported inflation:

https://preview.redd.it/2ff20tfolmbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=369e27f7d5f1a771202344f1223b198a34f10bd8

Most of the difference between these two values is the productivity gains that the government has stolen from you. 

They do this by conflating CPI with real inflation. 

\----

Inflation is not prices, inflation is the expansion of the money supply. 

Imagine that the aggregate productivity increases of globalization (to use just one example) should have translated into a 10% decrease in consumer prices across the board.

Enter, Keynesian Economics. A decrease in consumer prices is bad! Without much evidence to support it, the assumption is that a reduction in consumer prices will create a negative feedback loop that will cause Recession. 

Enter, The Federal Reserve. Their Keynesian mandate: a 2% year-over-year increase in consumer prices, and they’ll inflate the money supply at what ever level is necessary to achieve this.

The result is that the entire benefit of any productivity increases that should have been realized by the consumer through reduced prices is stolen by The Federal Reserve through monetary inflation.

The primary benefactor of this becomes the government, who will realize a relative reduction in the real value of their massive debt and deficit burdens, allowing them to rapidly expand both - in real terms, not just nominally - as shown in the charts above.

This works, effectively, as an average 100% tax on all productivity gains that society has generated (and will generate) since our abandonment of sound money in the early 1970s. 

\---

You are a squirrel gathering nuts. You are allowed to keep only what you gather, less capital gains tax, of course. The only entity allowed to grow in real terms and in league with the technological advancements of humanity is the government – and this will continue until we return to sound money that is backed by something finite. 

This is a lesson that has already been taught by history before. It’s the entire reason the country was founded on sound money to begin with, and, sadly, it’s a lesson that’s going to have to be eventually retaught again.

15qyhx0,2023-08-14 15:52:11,I just went outside and saw a lot of trucks. The economy is BOOMiNG.," 

The US economy is BOOMING. Housing is slowly recovering, rent price are also slowly normalizing. Goods and services are now extremely profitable even when accounting for inflation.

I am a normal person, and let me tell you how I see things from the road.

I went for a short drive and saw 20-30 trucks hauling heavy ass loads. Gas and diesel are way down from their peaks. Everyone was out there enjoying summer, building shit, buying shit, and eating shit.

The soft landing is here.

The Yellow Cab trucking company went under, but they'll be the last. It was due to decades of poor management.

Smaller companies and owner operators have been getting created for almost 2 years now. 

What does that mean for you?

Trucking is the only way everyone in the country can have access to goods AND services that use any kind of tools or materials. If they are making money and have work, it will soon translate into you and the companies you work for, going down the same path--of making a shit ton of money.

What if GME offered an obscene amount of shares knowing that they wouldn't all be bought and only bought as a worst case scenario for the hedge funds?

What if they did a cap raise of 50 million shares all at a price of lets say $1000?

If hedge funds are forced to cover, that's their out.  Or for fun, we could do it at 2000.  Or, a range of prices.  The first million shares at 1000, the next at 1100, etc.

All current holders, Ryan Cohen, board members, etc would get diluted.  But, they would be getting diluted and the value of their shares would increase due to the raise being higher than the current stock price.

EXAMPLE. 50m shares at 300 are available right now.  They share 50m more at 1000 each.

Each share gets diluted by half, but each of the current shares gain 500 dollars of value.

Essentially, by selling the shares at 1000 each, current share value goes up to $650.

I don't know what I'm talking about, if what I'm suggesting is stupid, say so.  Or, get this to the top of wsb as a worst case trigger to pull.

zlcxqb,2022-12-14 01:04:51,Gave 145k$ to my son to set him up and now he won’t return my calls,"Hey guys, I don’t know where else to go but I asked around and found out that this is a highly regarded community of stock market connoisseurs.

The story goes as follows: 

I arrived to America at a young age, an immigrant with less than 100$. The land of dreams, worked my ass off doing multiple jobs, saving every penny I could find, never ate out, never drank much, never partied much.


At age 60 I had amassed enough money to retire, married an amazing woman who had more than enough money. Thinking back my only regret is not enjoying live more, I was always working.


I decided to give my son the opportunity I never had, and so I gave him 145k for him to deposit on save investments and collect dividends to have a little more freedom and enjoy things I never could.


That was about a year ago, but suddenly I started noticing things, he stopped eating with us, always sat as far as he could from me and my wife on family reunions, he stopped talking about this wonderful investments he was so eager to discuss last year (some game store, some FTX coins, some Luna coins, a towel and shampoo company and a movie theater…), I asked him the other day how his investments were doing but he latched out at me saying I wouldn’t understand and now he won’t return my calls and avoids me as much as he can.

What do you think happened? Should I ask him if he needs more money?

oiqb08,2021-07-12 12:31:40,Undervalued AF in an Overvalued Market: Morgan Stanley ($MS) Will Explode Soon,"Morgan Stanley is a diamond among rhinestones (no homo).

Now, before you call me a retarded boomer and tell me that this post belongs in r/investing or r/soyboybetacucks, just STFU for a second and keep reading. $MS is up 80% over the past year. Those are not boomer numbers. The market is realizing that $MS is not only a bigass bank but also a slut dragon.

Below are a few reasons why I think this GROWTH STOCK still has tremendous upside ahead:

* PE Ratio of 12 ⁉️
* Profit Margin of 25% ⁉️
* Operating Margin of 40% ⁉️
* $540B of cash on hand ⁉️⁉️⁉️ That's bigger than most companies' market caps
* Think of how many bold acquisitions this kind of war chest could fund. Especially with a market crash/recession imminent, Morgan Stanley is poised to go on a buying spree that would put my online shopping addicted mother to shame
* Has recently been making very aggressive investments in fintechs and wealth management platforms (most recently acquired E-Trade and outbid JP Morgan for Eaton Vance). These businesses are poised for growth going forward. Even the shittiest wealth management company out there (Robinhood) is growing more explosively than my Taco Bell diarrhea. And it's not a stretch to assume that more and more users like ourselves will jump from Robinhood to TDA, Merrill, or E-Trade. Everyone offers zero-fee trading now, it's not a moat or anything
* Literally a bulge bracket bank that the government and Fed will never allow to go tits up
* We are in an IPO/SPAC boom, and that just means more investment banking revenues. Also, if markets crash, then well-managed companies will start acquiring other businesses like crazy, and that also means more investment banking revenues. The house always wins
* Recently, certain factions of WSB have been clamoring to buy puts on banks for some reason. Why though? If the Fed makes emergency rate hikes, then banks will moon because higher interest rates are good for them. Or if inflation is only transitory and there are no emergency rate hikes, then banks will moon because lower inflation and an economic recovery are good for them. Inverse WSB

Even if my growth thesis is wrong, I'll still own a healthy, profitable company that has committed to $12B in share buybacks and quarterly dividends of $0.70 per share (3.1% yield at current prices). Come at me bro.

The earnings report is on Thursday. I predict a blowout

TLDR: Small waist, pretty face, with a big bank. If it helps, just think of it as a SPAC with $540B to invest in whatever they want.

**Exhibit B:**
https://subredditstats.com/r/Mcdonalds 
https://subredditstats.com/r/Cooking
As you can see here, the Cooking subreddit gets a little over 46x the amount of posts per day as the McDonald's subreddit. This is extremely bearish as it probably means more people are interested in cooking than they are interested in McDonald's food. I'd also like to add, the vegetarian subreddit gets 5x the amount of posts as the McDonald's sub, and the vegan subreddit gets 23x the amount of posts as McDonald's. 

Speaking of the McDonald's subreddit...

8e6x9l,2018-04-22 22:58:02,How do I major in stocks?,"So I happen to be pretty good at stocks. One day I decided that I would try the stock market (after watching The Big Short), because I'm smart, and it's a good way at getting money, and I had lost a good amount of money in what turned out to be an MLM company? (my mom told me that it was a pyramid scheme, but they showed me the shape and it was an upside down triangle, not a pyramid, but that's not the point). Someone suggested that I get a Robinhood account, so I downloaded the app and opened an account up! I put in about $10, found a cheap stock, and made almost $3 within a matter of a few days! Can you imagine how much money I would've made if I had put more in? This is WAY better than my Ally Bank Account!

So I decided that I was going to be very risky, so I researched the best stocks of 2018! I deposited almost $300, and found this company called SPY. I looked at the fundamentals, and the company's financial documents seem to look solid! I zoomed out for the 5 year chart, and it only seems to go up! If I had put in money five years ago, I almost would have so much! How's that for a stock choice! I bought in and made so much money percentage-wise!

Now, the stock market is like gambling, and I'm 2 for 2, so I want to take my knowledge to Wall Street, because they (and all of you) seem to need it. However, when I look at my University business majors, all I see are majors like ""Finance"" and ""Accounting"", but no majors in stocks! Is there even a stocks major? Help?

By the way, if any of you need some good stock picks, keep an eye on me, because at this rate, I'll be a millionaire soon!",1,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8e6x9l/how_do_i_major_in_stocks/,wallstreetbets

GME value was hyped into an undisputed bubble, because people wanted to see the narrative come true. I see people with diamond hands calling to hold despite losing over 80%, but let's be honest, holding doesn't make stock prices go up. You need buyers for it to go up. And people are out of money. The smart players bought low and sold high.

lb3tz7,2021-02-02 19:16:45,WSB POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVISM IN GME?,"As I write this GME is trading at \~$103/sh with a $7.2B market cap.

I'm writing this to talk about GME objectively, not that ""to the moon""  or ""10k isn't a meme"" bullshit or some stupid misplaced crusade against wall street. I'm here to make money.

Right now GME has $586M in CACE ($140M of which is restricted so really $446M to do whatever they want with). Their assets have shrunk most notably from writing down almost $2 BILLION in goodwill over the last couple years. Right now the company has ZERO in goodwill, basically saying it's brand is worthless. I disagree with this after the hype WSB has created for this company. On the liability side, as of Q320, they have $224M and $216M in s-t and l-t debt, respectively, for total debt of $450M.

**GME PLEASE ISSUE STOCK.**

I know it will dilute the shit out of SHs and drop the price but I think it would be a huge buying opportunity. The fact that they haven't already is incomprehensible and arguably negligent. They could've issued 4-5M shares when this thing was over $300 at $200-250/sh and brought in $1B cash. But that's irrelevant now. What they could do is still issue stock, I'm not sure what price they could get for it but I'd be a buyer. Let's say they issue 5M shares at $100/sh, that's $500M cash... $500M would be HUGE in transforming the business. Up that to 10M shares and they bring in $1B. I think $1B is > than $500M. 

They could use $250M to pay down debt and the other half to really catalyze the transformation.

Video gaming is a growth industry and yes, brick and mortar is slowing dying, but as DFV said in his original thesis, that's a long way off.

GME needs to use the hype that WSB CULTIVATED for its brand and capitalize on it. The company couldn't have asked for a better xmas present than what's happening now. People are buying fucking billboards for GME. The company could be to gaming, what Chewy (a >$40B market cap) is to the pet industry. And clearly Ryan Cohen feels this way, too. GME needs to entrench itself into the gamer lifestyle and I really think raising funds now would accelerate this.

**Financials**

Right now I'm estimating GME will make $5B in revenues in 2020, so we're trading at 1.4x depressed revenues. For comparison CHWY trades at \~6x revenue, per yahoo finance. This is a company that made >$8B in 2018 and 2017.

They recently reported holiday sales (Nov and Dec) of $1.7B, down 1.9% yoy with 11% less stores open. SSS comps +4.8% yoy. But here's the most positive, digital sales were +309% yoy, and $1.35B ytd. As digital sales grow, this should help alleviate SG&A expenses which have historically crushed profitability. In 2017, 2018, and 2019 SG&A was $2B, and for 2020 it's looking like it'll be \~$1.4-1.5B.

**Valuation**

This is a very basic back-of-envelope calculation. But if GME can return to \~$8B in revenues (which is entirely possible and reasonable IF they can execute). And maintains historic GM's of \~30%, we get $2.4B in gross profit. And if digital sales continue to make up a larger chunks of revenues and they close redundant stores, they should be able to keep that SG&A expense under $2B. Let's say they can get it to $1.6B, which is about $100-150M above what SG&A will probably be this year (accounting for store reopenings).

So $8B revenues, 30% GM, $2.4B gross profit, $1.6B SG&A = $800M in operating income.

Assuming \~30% tax rate => $560M in net income.

If this plays out, we're currently trading at \~12.9x ($7.2B/$560M) what could be a reasonable net income # in the next couple years. My point is that GME might not be as overvalued as people think.",0,0.47,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb3tz7/wsb_potential_for_activism_in_gme/,wallstreetbets

vdbhyt,2022-06-16 02:38:45,The Next Short Squeeze: $HOOD,"Alright, it's been a while since I posted here but I know how much some of you guys like short squeezes.

This isn't a P&L play, Robinhood's revenue growth has stopped as the retail trading bubble pops. I can't see it getting much better in the short term. Combine that with the PFOF (Payment For Order Flow) ban, and you might be asking why anyone would buy this stock.

Robinhood doesn't have any debt. Check the [balance sheet](https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2022/q1/Robinhood-Exhibit-99.1_3.31.22_FINAL.pdf), it's pristine. They have a book value (total assets - total liabilities) around $8.22 per share according to [finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&ty=c&ta=1&p=m), I checked it and got $8.40 but I might've gotten the number of shares incorrect. It's currently trading around $7.20 a share after hours, meaning that if the company gets liquidated, that's the value returned to shareholders. 

Not only that, but Robinhood has $6.19B in cash on hand as of their last earnings report, but is trading at a market cap of $6.15B. I bought some shares today, meaning I am straight up buying cash for less than it's worth. If someone told you that you could buy a $20 bill for $19.95, you'd take that deal as many times as you could get it.

Market fear over banning of PFOF, retail trading dying out, and a general market hatred for the boy from Bulgaria who runs it have created this insane opportunity for a short squeeze.

According to [fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/hood), HOOD currently has a short interest of 11.28%. FTX [recently](https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-exchange-ftx-ceo-reveals-stake-trading-app-robinhood-2022-05-12/) bought up 7.6% of their float. This means there are less shares being traded, a low float is key for a squeeze.

My thesis is that it will just take one piece of positive news regarding a potential buyout or hedge fund purchase, which is very likely at these levels, to cause a big short covering rally in the stock. I'd target the $12-15 range. The best news is that you know Vlad won't turn off the buy button for this one.",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vdbhyt/the_next_short_squeeze_hood/,wallstreetbets
twcc5b,2022-04-04 20:36:15,Is AMC primed to rip soon?,"&#x200B;

Cost to borrow has been relatively flat for AMC since the June run up. Through volatility and scarcity in shares it was low. It looks like it is reverse coursing upward now according to Ortex data. This is good news for bulls and bad for bears.

https://preview.redd.it/mh97bvi5nkr81.png?width=1369&format=png&auto=webp&s=33f9cbd46204cea6c990a99ae42f9df4f2c8ac50

Utilization \[% of total shares that are lendable that are actually borrowed\] has been sitting at 100% for some time now, last time it did this was prior to its run in June. The times it came down from 100% utilization were when it bounced up a bit on the first initial volume spike then the price came down a bit and then Utilization popped back to 100% and it then ran to $70. I have a feeling we see a dip in Utilization due to the recent run to $34 and a spike back up to 100% after it got shot back down in the next update.

https://preview.redd.it/rb0b35d4nkr81.png?width=1269&format=png&auto=webp&s=af194a7bbc89c473170b1657e23fdd041293d4c5

Volume has done rips and then dips then finally a rip on both the January and June run up. This seems to be a similar trend on AMC right now. Maybe it leads to something? Will there be a second volume bounce now that it cooled off for a few days? I believe it will but who really knows?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vs1zmngankr81.png?width=1361&format=png&auto=webp&s=41bfe6aa59ce4e2c8f350237e4677e918d0cbc9a

Shares on loan average were 60 days prior to June run up. Who the fuck holds a short position over 30 days unless they are dumbasses? Well now its fuckin 80 days man. Holy shit what is wrong with them... they could have covered at $12.90 and then renewed a short position now at a much higher level. The average short fuckin held through that. They either CANT cover because it is too much or they truly think it will come down back to $12 and below.

https://preview.redd.it/7fpgxo3cnkr81.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=8767ec5e21ba2a3a1e7ab4d9081e2c7b4fd03f5a

Days to cover in all 4 \[2 week/3 month on loan/estimated SI\] have all shown a up move, then a drop, then a short cool off before having second drop in the June run up. Currently DTC on all 4 have dropped, now its is cooling off.. will we see a second drop in DTC indicators?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ups6dukdnkr81.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e8f018ce0e3b275b3f47f760785fb3531226cc8

Then finally, higher short interest then the June run up. Shares on loan are less \[even with 100% utilization\], to me this just means the short sellers have less shares to try and push this shit back down after it does rip. Maybe I am wrong. Correct me if so.

I can talk about fundamentals improvements \[long line up of movies, sitting on a shit ton of cash, gold mine investment actually worked out for them, debt pushed to 2029 from 2026 with some high interest debt paid, they are going to make a popcorn product to buy at grocery stores and they are also coming out with a credit card\]. With all the fundamental improvements alone, I dont see this shit being less then $30 just because it held so high and for such a long time last year. $30+ in my opinion.

o9bsl2,2021-06-28 03:14:14,Ford 2023 Long Calls,"I know it's not a lot, but I'm putting in around $213 for three 2023 Ford Calls with a strike price of $30. Ford is a good brand. Ford is quintessentially American and a keystone of innovation. Here is why I like ford. Tesla is expensive. German electric (VW, Audi, Mercedes, Porsche) is pretty pricey, not to mention that VW uses a different charging adapter than Tesla, which creates even more confusion for the average consumer (""Why can't I charge at this Walmart?""). Ford has been undervalued ever since they decided not to take the 2008 bail-out money. That's okay since that ship has sailed and they are out from this for the most part.

Americans for the most part don't like change. Electric cars bring change. Between having to charge at home or at work, finding a new mechanic, or even learning all the new ins and outs of an electric car, this change and influx of new information is scary for the average American consumer. No matter the brand of car, new electric cars will bring this plight. Keeping with what they know (which is American-made-American brands), these consumers would opt for Ford in a heartbeat (if ford is all they have ever owned). There is brand loyalty in the car sector. Once someone finds something they like, they tend to stick with that car or brand for as long as they can, or until they feel they need a switch. 

1. Ford has brand loyalty from its current base, which can make the shift to electric more comfortable.
2. Old people aren't buying electric cars (new cars, even) en masse. The CPI-E shows a rise in their cost of living. This will affect everyone, but for someone with higher living and healthcare costs (old people), buying a car might not be a top priority (plus if you're not able to drive in a few, the opportunity of the car purchase might be too great compared to saving money for healthcare or fun things).  
3. Electric competition is not great. Cadillac is barely in the door, Toyota Electric is viewed as a luxury level, not an alternative choice for the avg consumer, Honda has a few electric cars (but they're seriously no fun--cmon, cars should be fun. Ford has fun, Ford has innovation. Ford has price, Ford has variety. 
4. Compared to other car companies, ford stock is dumb cheap. 
5. Ford's lineup is their greatest strength. A car for everyone. Electric or not. In every price range. In every industry. Electric cars being fully mainstream should be about 10 years out. We're lagging in chargers, acceptance, and price. Ford hybrid vehicles fill this void, all while not separating electric or nonelectric into higher classes of luxury features (Toyota). Electric here is not a status symbol, it is a mainstream dream, and Ford wants it to become reality.

Cyberpunk isn't our reality. Tunnels going between cities isn't coming anytime soon. The cybertruck is a luxury vehicle with a boastful design that screams (look at me, I've got money, and even if this car can tug a boat, I don't care, I'm definitely a suburbanite with a brand new toy.) Tesla's are cool. Tesla's are fun. But they catch eyes, and they make electric cars a status symbol, rather than an environmental obligation. Ford combats that, directly, fairly, and even if some of their prices (Mach-E with a starting price fo 41k-ish) is a bit high, the Mach-E is just a fun version of a mustang and is meant to catch eyes, unlike the Lightning or the Fusion.

Ford's lineup: [https://www.ford.com/](https://www.ford.com/)

Inflation is looming: Sure, probably, it might already be here. I don't care. Economies go in cycles, boo hoo. People will always need cars. Might not be able to purchase a car, but who cars, you can lease. Ford has their own leasing LLC under their ticker, and more importantly, FORD HAS AFFORDABLE VEHICLES THAT SUIT A WIDE RANGE OF NEEDS THAT DONT COMPROMISE TOO MUCH QUALITY FOR THEIR PRICE OR CHANGE IN SIZE. 

Ford is a value investment. What are your thoughts?",10,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9bsl2/ford_2023_long_calls/,wallstreetbets

1. A low float stock that can move significantly if volume comes in
2. A merger and a ticker change to generate media coverage and bring the volume in
3. A cult-like following with a track record of pouring their money into Donnie T related opportunities

The issue with this was the fixation on the 500 bagger. While DJT certainly could have tested it's ATH at $190 before 3/28, that was obviously not a likely outcome, especially when everyone was betting on it.

While, unfortunately the 500 bagger didn't play out, there is still good news. The move that we did get has now primed this stock for a perfect setup, potentially plowing through $80 and toward the $190 ATH. Longs are moping around with their worthless calls talking about how it was a ""good ride"" and shorts are already bragging about the easy tendies they are going to make from fading this POS company into oblivion.

The consensus is now that the play is dead in the water which is why this is the perfect opportunity to take the opposite side.

HEAR ME OUT:

1. Be patient with the MAGA crowd. The snail mail that boomers have been writing to their financial advisors instructing them to smash the fucking bid on DJT isn't going to arrive until next week. The blue-collar crew have been wanting to pile in but are still waiting on their bi-weekly pay check to hit. Give them time. They are a little slower moving than us degen gamblers, but rest assured, they are still making their way to the party.
2. This stock is majorly short-biased now. Borrow rate now at 600%: [(link to post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqk2av/djt_short_borrow_rate_at_600/). Everyone is just assuming that this is a layup short and that Trump will dump his stock soon which is unlikely in my view. If this thing does not immediately plummet next week, bears are going to be shitting the bed.
3. In addition to the looming MAGA volume and the potential for upside down shorts, there will be massive FOMO from retail if we start to get a move to the upside. Traders that lost money on the initial run up or missed it entirely will stumbling over each other to get back in.
4. The stock is up like 100% in a week and has essentially just spent the last few days consolidating sideways ABOVE the local high of $58.72 from the previous spike in January. From a purely technical perspective, this doesn't really look like a one and done rally that is just going to dump infinitely from here. Dare I say the chart might even look a bit bullish?
5. FED was dovish last meeting. GDP print was strong yesterday. Rates have been gently coming down this week. Inflation ticking up a bit recently but not enough for anyone to actually take it seriously yet. Not that this is a macro-play at all, but I do think positive sentiment around the macro environment is a prerequisite for a move like this to take place.
6. **Easter Fucking Weekend.** What better way to spread the DJT word than some familial chit chat over a lovely Easter Sunday meal. Devouring turkey and deviled eggs, celebrating the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, and a wee bit of hot stock gossip. I can already hear my Granny now, ""Should I buy me some of that Donald Trump stock?"" Yes, Granny. Yes, you should.

MY POSITIONS (will likely be adding Monday morning if all goes accordingly):

https://preview.redd.it/h3bqrpkag9rc1.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=d70f60e6c8a00310108c16712dbb10200557c38e

DISCLAIMER: Not investment advice. Do your own DD. No offense intended to any of the parties referenced in this post. I have much love and respect for everyone. Especially my Granny.

UPDATE 03/29/24: All-In Podcast discusses DJT at length [(link to clip)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1001s). Chamath compares DJT to ""Bowie Bonds"" where people will be using it as a vehicle to invest in Trump's brand which will have a significantly different value placed on it than the revenues of a shitty social media company. David believes that many Trump supporters will buy the stock as a ""protest vote"". Lot of eyes on this podcast and they discuss the topic in a very serious manner. Honestly, think this is more than enough to fuel a gap up on Monday morning. Good luck to all.

UPDATE 03/30/24: I am also long \~500k of the DJT crypto token [(link to token)](https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0x32a6047bded36b985534750a4292a35d5dbd4e5f?utm_source=coingecko&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=searchresults) which has seen a fair amount of buying throughout the weekend. Makes me hopeful that more and more attention is being allocated toward the ""Long Trump"" play. Excited for trading on the DJT stock to get going again. If we are gapping up on Monday morning, I will probably look to buy more calls for 4/5. If we are gapping down, will see how it holds up in the morning and assess from there. Good luck everyone.

UPDATE 03/31/24: Happy Easter to everyone who celebrates it. My granny did not mention the DJT stock nor did any of my relatives. We are currently gapping down on RH, but not necessarily to levels that I would consider the play to be over. Not gonna lie... it's not looking great for my thesis, but I think we still have a chance. See you guys bright and early tomorrow. Good luck folks.

UPDATE 04/01/24: This is not an April Fools joke. It appears that I was utterly wrong on this DD. We are currently down \~25% on the day which is essentially the exact opposite of what I was anticipating. GG to the bears. I hope you are taking profits though because this still seems an incredible risky stock to be short. I threw some chump change at a few calls on the morning dip. Just going to ride them all out to expiry since they are essentially worthless already anyway. Probably not gonna post anymore updates unless this starts ripping people's faces off. Fingers crossed.

ljtshl,2021-02-14 18:14:16,$BNTX massively undervalued - the COVID guys,"Hi fellow retards,

long term $BB and $AMD investor here. Wanted to point your short attention span to a massively undervalued, hidden champion from the COVID vaccine and cancer treatment world:

**$BNTX** 

**Some facts**

* They own one of two **actually working COVID vaccines** (mRNA). *COVID is this thing that keeps you at home, in case you didn't realize.*
* They have a **50/50 commercial agreement with Pfizer** (sharing cost and revenue)
* US paid **$19.90** per dose - poorer countries pay probably less, richer more- **assuming an average revenue of $10** per dose here
* Their 2021 production capacity just increased to max. **2bn doses/year** 
* Based on this, I'm estimating a **$20bn** (that's 10 zeros) FY2021 revenue**, Pfizer and BioNTech combined on the vaccine only**, up from a few hundred k in 2020. 
* Expected net **profit $10bn** for BioNTech 
* BNTX's market cap just $21bn - that could make a **four or five bagger** from here
* Vaccine **can be easily adjusted** to target new mutants - and won't need lengthy re-approvals (see Reuters news today). 
* Your wife's boyfriend will probably need **two fresh shots every year** to stay safe  
* **Biontech CEO Ugur is on a mission - cycling to the lab (**Papa factor)
* COVID is just a side-business - they have a healthy cancer treatment pipeline
* **Q4 2020 earnings call expected for March**

Plot twist. Twitter is now going to have to focus on lawsuits from advertisers who have been massively overpaying to advertise to bots and shills.

Twitter has literally been ripping off advertisers. Oh, you want your ad to reach 100,000,000 viewers? Done. Oh sorry we had our heads in the sand let’s just ignore the fact your ad only reached 50,000,000 viewers because half of them are either bots or bad actor accounts being paid to post by shady entities.

The door is open for lawsuits galore.

I’m impartial to Elon. I know with you guys some love him, some hate him, and there is no in between.

But I do think it made sense for him to back out of the deal. He would have basically been buying a used car dealership and having to waste more money than he would have spent buying the dealership fixing all the cars that looked good on paper but were flaming death traps waiting to happen in reality.

I think this was a smart move on his part. Twitter did everything they could to try to hide the actual extent of their own corruption and did not pass the engine check.

Fair game in my opinion and if I wasn’t worried about lost opportunity cost in other areas I’d really be considering puts on Twitter.

2. Tension with the West

3. Slowing population growth

4. Fraudulent accounting

Consider the upside risks at these levels:

1. Xi passes laws supporting private enterprise to regain trust of investors

2. Still strong GDP growth at 5%/year even while facing so many headwinds

3. Healthy transition from property to consumer led economy

lkq6wm,2021-02-15 23:29:48,"SILVER, the investment that has no risk and infinite possibilities! DD on $PSLV and more!🚀","Ok no risk might be clickbait, no investment is fully risk-free but I still stand buy my point: buy silver, let me explain:

Silver massively undervalued and like GME it's possible to fuck with Wall street if it squeezes. A silver squeeze you ask? Isn't the silver market too big to squeeze? Silver ETF SLV (which is a scam) admits it's possible and that they're vulnerable to one. [http://gata.org/node/20913](http://gata.org/node/20913)

How is a squeeze possible then? Let me quote a Bloomberg article of 2014 to explain:  ""About $5 trillion of silver and $18 trillion of gold circulated globally last year, according to CPM Group"". $5 trillion dollar you say... After a quick search on the internet you will find that both total supply and total demand for silver hovers around 1 billion ounces a year. [https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/](https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/) This would mean that in 2014 (when the price was around $20 per ounce) the true circulating supply was $20 billion, a difference of 250 times! This difference is what we call 'paper silver' and just like paper hands it sucks, driving down the price. 

If the price of silver increases massively, those who create paper silver will lose a lot of money, and if it keeps rising it's just a matter of time before futures and fake ETF's will stop providing it. If that happens the price of silver will inevitably rise way further as supply will decrease up to 250x!

BTW: In the near past JPM was punished for manipulating the silver market as well, just a sign that stuff like this happens to a market this big.

ATTENTION  **🌈🐻** :

Are your expectations on the market negative? Do you think stock prices will fall? Do you believe we are in a bubble? I found the perfect investment: Silver! After the great recession and the short crash last year silver crashed quickly before it rose to the occasion. In 2008 it crashed a bit, only to rise almost 5x afterwards. In 2020 it dropped to appox $12 an ounce and rose to nearly $30. If you think the stock market will crash, this is a great opportunity.

Ok, now that the **🌈🐻** are interested, we can continue.

Time lag is a phenomenon in economics where there is a delay between an action and a consequence. Right now we are in the middle of this. As silver is sold in many forms (Physical, ETF, Trust, Futures) it's prone to price lag. Look at your local Bullion dealer. Are there many coins/bars in stock? Probably not, and the price has hardly increased last month. By buying trusts that actually own silver like $PSLV and $PHAG you can profit off this phenomenon.

READ IF YOU'RE A BOOMER:

Silver is actually a great long-term investment. It is important for many technologies we will see a lot of in the future. Think about batteries, solar panels and medicine. With the market for all of these 3 increasing quickly. This could be sped up by the US government if the current administration starts funding projects for renewable energy and electric cars. Also, in 10 years we will see a peak in Silver mining, but after that there will most likely be a decline in supply until the mines are almost completely empty. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344913002747#sec0080](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344913002747#sec0080) 

Important sidenote: If you want to profit of a possible squeeze you can also look into buying stock of silver miners. These will obviously rise a lot if the price of silver goes to what it should be worth. 

Conclusion: There are many possible scenarios imaginable in which silver prices will rise a lot, both in the short and long term. Buying silver futures does nothing, nor will buying $SLV. Buy physical silver or silver trusts which market values are the same as the amount of silver in their vault! 

TL;DR: 

Is this really needed? Buy silver!!  🚀  🚀  🚀 (NOT SLV)

stsz1w,2022-02-16 10:45:21,Why I’m bearish on SPY (The end of the middle class),"Don’t you ape motherfucking Vicks understand what is happening? SPY is breaking all time highs… what does that mean? The rich are getting richer. If you look at the chart and compare it to the middle class you can see a direct correlation. As SPY goes up, the wealth in the middle class goes down. As corporations grow the only people getting rich are those running the show. Sure maybe a couple of apes who bought straight OTM with 0DTE make a few but the real people making money are the people who are running the show. In fact, this whole page which is dedicated to sticking it to the man only allows you to post large cap stocks thus increasing the value for those who already are millionaires while the average retail investor just loses their life savings. This page has turned into the opposite of what it is. Soon the American people will realize that and soon SPY will crash as once the middle class recovers this will go down. It’s not the rich that control the people. The people control the rich. We’re their number one source of income. So one day, maybe not today, or the next, but one day, mark my works, the middle class will rise again.

100k by age 25 would be relatively easy if you had a job when you were 17 that paid at least 30k a year, and stayed at home another 3 years before getting roomies. In fact, you'd have made 220k in that time period.

The alternative is to obviously yolo. Yes this includes big earners. Let me explain.

While the average life expectancy is 72.8. Most people are seriously worn out by then in some way or another. Odds are your fucking days are over by then and you look like a prune.

Ideally you'd shoot for retirement (realistically) by age 45 max. That gives you another 10 years of your mature, but not elderly, life. Seriously, the best case scenario is you move to an elderly ""party village"" in FL we're you'll prolly catch and STD and die within the decade anyways.

Take it from me, living a conservative lifestyle is a miserable existence. God forbid you're single too. It's tolerable until you hit 30 and by then you're just fed up with being sub-par.

The odds are NOT in your favor but they never were. So how is this any different you degenerate retard?

rqtos2,2021-12-29 00:04:28,MRNA is a $30 stock,"I don't do DD.  I look at things from a 10000 foot view.  From my elevation Moderna looks way overvalued.  In December of 2018 Moderna's IPO was the largest biotech IPO in history valuing the company at an incredible $7.5B.  At the time they were touting their research into mRNA as ""the software of life"".  The news story that I read said that there was "" no mRNA-based drug has ever been approved by the FDA nor any other regulatory agency, so it will be years before Moderna will be able to bring anything to market"".  Well that changed pretty quickly and the market went crazy.  Taking the crazy valution from $7.5B to $200B before backing off to the current $100B.  Does the fact that they came up with a fairly effective vaccine (and we don't want to get into the whole debate here about how effective it was) mean that they should now be valued at 12 x what they were worth when they IPO'd?  I say no.  The next drug that they come up with is going to have to go through regular clinical trials and won't have the advantage  of being needed by every human being on the planet.  So what is it worth?  I gave my prediction away in the headline.  For  the first 18 or so months of its existence it was a $20 stock.  Their tech is now a bit more proven so in my mind I'll give them a 50% bump.  That makes it a $30 stock.  I also think that it's going to go down faster than most people think.  Here in Canada, where we have a much higher vaccine acceptance rate, there is resistance to the booster.  Tens of thousands of available appointments are going unfilled in the midst of the Omicron wave.  Covid is largely being ignored.  The government is advising against travel yet everyone I know is travelling for the holidays.  No one that I know cancelled a trip because of Omicron.  If the plane was leaving, they were going to be on it.  When you hear that someone has Covid now you kind of feel badly for them because they have to isolate for a few days.  You're not worried that they are going to die.  Is this a population that is going to rush out and get the booster.  no way.  There's talk of changing the definition of ""fully vaccinated"" to include a booster but I can't see the political will to do that when the population is effectively ""voting"" by abstaining.  Politician's first job is to get elected and second job is to get re-elected.  They know that.  When there is a 70% uptake in vaccines they can  come up with mandates.  When there is a 40% (I made that number up) uptake in boosters, they won't be quite so quick to mandate them.

I picked Moderna and bought long $70 puts.  I think that Novavax would be just as good a target.

Disney partnership with Ubisoft to make Star Wars games; fans were extremely disappointed with EA and their shitty battlefronts. This means Disney wants to expands their presence even more on the Video Game Industry. Just wait till they start making more game for their multiple franchises. Fucking Mickey Mouse, Toy Story, Marvel and every other game they can make.

^^^^ They started this trend by partnering with Fortnite, you know where kids waste their parents credit card on useless skins? 

And the best for last: Disney’s only operating half its business, when the parks, cruises and movies get back to normal this will be at least $500.

If you are have been locked in a basement for a while you may have missed that real-estate market has been hot. Low rates has made bored desperate housewifes think of buying a new house with a pool or second home where to go on a romantic weekend with their boyfriend. Try and buy a condo in a popular vacation spot like Miami. Condos are gone within a week of listing, sometimes within a day.

Mortgage rate is 3%, which makes owning a real-estate a great hedge against inflation. If inflation kicks in then the $300k condo today will be $400k in few years. And your house payment will be much lower in today’s money versus in 5 years.

**Mortgage numbers in 2020 gave been best ever**

December mortgage numbers 26% higher than year ago (Refi up 102% from last year)

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/mortgage-demand-from-homebuyers-spikes-28percent.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/mortgage-demand-from-homebuyers-spikes-28percent.html)

January mortgage numbers 16% higher than year ago

For the year, Loan Origination on volume grew 71% annually, but the data is even better, because if you consider the refi’s which do not add to the volume, **there was a 158% growth in refinancing YOY.**

[https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loan-officers-made-insane-money-in-q4-2020/](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loan-officers-made-insane-money-in-q4-2020/)

If rates start to increase we may see even more refi efforts in 2021 to capture the low interest rates.

**Alright, so why Rocket Mortgage?**

Well it is often in the **top 3 best rated mortgage companies**. In addition, the company’s its primary focus is mortgages unlike Chase of BoA. So if mortgage numbers are good, then their numbers will be really good because their revenues is heavily depended on mortgages.

Brand recognition - It’s probably one of the most recognizable names for mortgages. Their website gets over 110 million visits per year. More than any other mortgage site.

They are innovative, they have developed a directory for all of the local mortgage brokers. Now this is interesting. They are listing the brokers and do not charge any fees for the leads to the brokers whether they work with Rocket Mortgage or not for the load. That’s lost revenue right? Well, I think that they are building a good relationship with the local brokers, so that the brokers can get the origination fee and then send them business back to get the loan via Rocket Mortgage.

**Share ownership**

They IPOd around $21.50, then went as high as $30m, and then dropped to $20 levels. **Short interest in Rocket Mortgage is 30%. But the leadership team owns 95% of the entire Rocket Companies** parent company. So this shows huge insider holding of this company, which clearly indicates their strong belief in this company. Check out their CEO’s message to the shorts [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/29/rocket-companies-ceo-on-the-stocks-friday-surge.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/29/rocket-companies-ceo-on-the-stocks-friday-surge.html)

**Buzz**

There will be a buzz for rocket mortgage. They will have two superbowl ads this year to stay current and in people’s minds. This should play well with the time leading up to their earnings call which is coming up later in February. This can be a catalyst for the stock (it jumped last week to 23.50 with the whole shorts frenzy)

I have a good conviction on this company, but I am open to hear opposite views from you degenerates.

o6t0yw,2021-06-24 03:54:50,Why $WISH for something you already have? $BABA DD,"Tl;Dr: BABA is the preferred alternative to WISH from a value/fundamentals perspective.

$WISH and $BABA both excel in selling chinese shit to american consumers. $WISH’s growth rate looks incredibly tempting. They grew revenue by 35% last year. 

However, $WISH lost $745 million last year. Ouch. Worst of all, nearly $400M of that is stock-based compensation to pad the pockets of management, as well as $265m in G&amp;A expenses for their new lofty salaries, a 300% increase in spending from 2019.

So $WISH is burning YOUR cash and diluting shares to grow its revenue. They’re paying management massive salaries, giving them stock compensation while stockholders suffer losses.

Wouldn’t you rather get the same exposure and performance from a company making money?

Let’s take a look at $BABA.

TTM Revenue $110B

TTM FCF $34.5B

TTM FCF growth 20%

TTM Revenue growth 40% vs. $WISH 35%

5 year average Revenue growth 45%

3 year average FCF growth 30%, $AAPL 20%, S&amp;P 25%

Price/TTM FCF 16.5x, $AAPL 23.7x, S&amp;P 25.5x, $WISH has no FCF.

Price/TTM FCF/3yr growth .5-.85, $AAPL 1.2, S&amp;P 1

Market cap $572B

Book value $150B

Bear Case: Assuming company maintains current FCF and dies in 20 years, generates $680B cash for shareholders. $680B + $150B book value = undervalued by $250B

Bull case: Company maintains 20% FCF growth for 10 years, $213B in FCF by 2031, generates $3000B over 20 years for shareholders = undervalued by $2500B

5-year DCF model using 5 yr averages with a 8% discount rate and 2% perpetual growth/10yr yield puts this stock at $350.

Oh, and all these valuations assume no Ant group IPO, which alibaba could own a $50B stake in. Not to mention the massive moat and diversity in revenue stream for $BABA.

No need to $WISH for gains or growth. They’re already here in $BABA.",10,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o6t0yw/why_wish_for_something_you_already_have_baba_dd/,wallstreetbets

UPS is investing $30b into employee salary and benefits over 5 years. 

UPS has $9b cash on hand. 

Scratching my head on this one. How is UPS affording these raises? They are going to have to take on extra debt or sell shares. They make $10b/year profit. They are going to have to spend $6b/year just for the employees. **They just cut their profit by 60%**. Am I missing something? And these costs will go up after 5 years, you'll have a much higher percentage of employees sitting at 5+ years and higher percentage of full time employees (that's what happens when you offer $170k for a job that requires no education). 

Seems to me like UPS deserves a 50% correction. Am I wrong?

EDIT: to all you dumb regards saying ""HAHA YOU BOUGHT PUTS AMIRITE????"" stfu. I literally don't have **any** positions in the market, and I am broke AF and won't be investing any time in the near future.

> Seems to me like UPS deserves a 50% correction. Am I wrong?

This is an open ended question and the post is tagged as 'discussion'. Some of you need to grow the fuck up and learn to read.

And stop treating this like some DD. It's not. I saw a few numbers, had a few thoughts, and threw them down, and asked a question. This post reflects my initial thoughts on the matter. That's it. $30b over 5 years seemed like a fuck ton, but as pointed out to me, UPS already spends $44b/year on employees, so if that's the case then $30b over 5 years isn't that much. Done. My question answered. I asked, ""Am I wrong?"" answer is yes because I was missing some context. HOLY SHIT I WAS WRONG? idgaf. This was a question I posted out of curiosity. I'm not even in the fucking market.

EDIT 2: as some have pointed out, $170k is including benefits, and at 60 hours/week. Totally different than what I assumed, which is what my entire question was based on.

**LAST EDIT** No need to comment on this anymore you regards. $170k figure was wrong. It's $120k + benefits, and that's at 60 hours a week. Totally different story. I think that's reasonable and maybe only 5-10% higher than I would have thought. UPS will be fine.

l57i0n,2021-01-26 05:51:36,The Bullish Thesis for NEE 🔋🚀,"# NextEra Energy is the play that you need to make if you believe in Biden's infrastructure reforms.

(before reading, note that they are reporting earnings on the morning of the 26th, I will be taking advantage of the IV crush to open a LEAP position)

To start, I see an awful amount of praise for ETF's when playing this sector. However, while ETF's offer greater security in individual investments, the true risk and reward of playing this sector becomes apparent through the lens of comparison. The three ETF's I concentrated on for this DD are:

* **ICLN**
* **TAN**
* **FAN**

While these are all popular, none of them have weighted NEE anywhere near its capitalization potential. Just the next two years alone will nearly certainly double the stock's market cap. They have over $50B in infrastructure investments planned through 2022, and you can be assured that they will have an advantage to this [in the form of tax credits and subsidies.](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/nee-stock-is-ready-to-soar-under-green-biden-administration/)

That's right, Uncle Sam is going to skullfuck this company with tax credits and subsidies to the point that this thing could have a TSLA-esque potential. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, how does this company look when lined up among some competition?

The particular interest with NEE is that they seemingly do it all. This shit is like the Chic-Fil-A of the energy sector. It could honestly not give less of a shit about saving the world, its only focus is cash flow, which in terms that WSB is accustomed to, is just fuel reserves for its inevitable moon mission. I analyzed 3 different companies in the renewable energy sector, and those were

1. Plug Power
   1. slowing of net income in Q/Q growth.
2. Enphase
   1. already boomed. the party for this one got busted pretty fast. imo just a shitty boomer pick
3. First Solar
   1. This one is a legitimate competitor in my view. 
   2. I would honestly invest in this if its revenue sources were more diverse.

So taking these into account, NEE seems as if its obligatory duty is to take the throne of the renewable market (if you're for some reason doubting it even slightly)

# TLDR: EZ CASHFLOW, ECO-CONSCIOUS, and *bigly* expansion with tax credits incoming to help assist.

Elon, watch your six.

🌍 **XPEV IS EXPANDING LIKE A MOFO** 🚀 They're spreading faster than herpes during the prom night. They've invaded the [UAE, Thailand, and Egypt](https://electrek.co/2024/02/22/xpeng-motors-global-expansion-announcing-dealer-partnerships-5-new-markets/), with their G6 SUV leading the charge. And if you thought ""[Like a G6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4s6H4ku6ZY)"" was just a catchy tune, think again - it's XPEV's battle cry for world domination. They're also making power moves [in Europe](https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/xpeng-widens-europe-expansion) faster than the Zhukov in '45, giving the Germans a taste of their own medicine.

🤝 **VW IS THIRSTY FOR XPEV**  🌭  Volkswagen is so desperate for XPEV's tech, they're practically proposing marriage. Word on the street is that VW's entire electric lineup in China is gonna be powered by Xiaopeng's big brain energy. VW can't sell their MEB Platform-based EVs in China without bleeding cash, so they're going all-in on [XPEV's engineering nectar](https://www.volkswagen-group.com/en/articles/ready-for-next-ev-push-volkswagen-enters-into-agreement-with-xpeng-for-fast-joint-development-of-two-smart-e-cars-18246). We're talking about a massive revenue stream and validation of their tech on a global scale, you autists.

💰 **BUDGET BRAND = MASSIVE TENDIES** 💸 [XPEV is dropping a low-cost brand](https://cnevpost.com/event/xpeng-new-brand-debut/) that's gonna make their costs lower than your standards after a night of drinking. They're gonna be printing tendies faster than Jerome Powell can say ""transitory inflation.""

Now, here's the kicker - they've even got flying cars in the works. Yeah, you heard that right, the [Xpeng X2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-xpengs-drone-car-aeroht-voyager-x2-completes-low-altitude-flight-2024-03-08/). But I'm not even gonna elaborate, 'cause you'd think I'm smoking the same stuff as Hunter Biden in Forbidden City.

The Beijing Auto Show starts on 4/25, so we're expecting **GIGANTIC** announcements for points 4 and 5 before and during the car show. The stock has been tanking harder than your portfolio during a crypto winter, but that's about to change, you paper-handed cucks.

**XPEV literally can't go tits up,** 'cause VW is gonna come to the rescue if shit hits the fan. I wouldn't be surprised if the Germans swallow XPEV whole with a tender offering in the near future, 'cause they're so desperate for that sweet, sweet EV tech. 

And if this is my last post, just know that the local regulator probably Jack Ma'd me. 😉

Remortgage your mum's apartment for this, 'cause it's time to get fucking PAID.

TL;DR: XPEV 4/19 and 4/26 calls. Literally can't go tits up. 🚀🚀🚀

w5w8ix,2022-07-23 05:45:48,"After these earnings, $TWTR is insolvent pro forma for the $13 billion merger debt, which would blow up financing and end the deal","\*Not legal or investment advice

Terrible earnings from $TWTR today.

If $TWTR did not have the bid outstanding, it would be trading at $10-$15/share instead of $40/share. Look at $SNAP.

At $10-$15/share, Twitter's equity value is $8-$12 billion but it is trying to take on $13 billion of acquisition financing. Twitter also has negative FCF so difficult to service additional debt.

Why this is important: the $13 billion committed bank financing to acquire Twitter has a Solvency Certificate (pasted below). A ""senior authorized financial officer"" must sign the certificate saying that Twitter is solvent *after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions* (ie after taking on $13 billion of additional debt).

Under conventional definitions of solvency, Twitter would be insolvent with $13 billion of additional debt - zero to negative pro forma equity value, no free cash flow to service the debt.

What this means for the deal: 

The merger agreement includes a term that:  ""Parent \[essentially Musk\] fails to consummate the Merger as required pursuant to the Merger Agreement, including because the equity, **debt and/or margin loan financing is not funded, Parent will be required to pay Twitter a termination fee of $1.0 billion.**""

**If Twitter is unable to certify that it is solvent pro forma for $13 billion of additional debt, the financing does not close, which means the merger does not close which means Twitter only gets the $1 billion termination fee and not specific performance at $54.20/share. Which would result in Twitter trading at $11-$16/share (undisturbed price of $10-$15/share plus value of $1 billion termination fee).**

**Solvency Certificate**

**TLDR:** Post earnings, Twitter is insolvent pro forma for $13 billion of new debt. If insolvent, can't close on $13 billion of financing which means merger can't close at $54.20/share and Musk is only on the hook for a $1 billion break up fee. Without the merger, Twitter goes to $11-$16/share.

I don't have anything against them; make your money. But the way the system works, if you want the squeeze to happen, EVERYONE (or a vast vast majority) have to hold. 

Like a week ago, people would be hated on for having 420 sell limits. And theoretically, that is true, because selling will drive the price down. But people DID sell, and those people made bank and are ""paper hands"".

The people with insane amounts of money are the most likely to be paper hands and sell once they make a profit. If you're a whale with 100k invested, you have so much more to lose than someone who YOLOed 400 dollars and can just hold forever. It sucks WAY more to see 100k go to 50k than 400 to 200.

Because of this contradiction, it is inherently extremely difficult to create a short squeeze because people want to reduce their risks and make money. I don't blame them.

16gmwf3,2023-09-12 09:41:00,Why Starbucks is losing to Luckin Coffee in China and why this likely won’t change.,"With Luckin’s 2nd Quarter earnings report, it’s impactful partnership with Moutai and soon with Victoria Secret, Luckin Coffee is making headlines for all the right reasons.  Yesterday’s CNBC headline “How Luckin Coffee overtook Starbucks as the largest coffee chain in China” is turning even more heads.  As unbiased investors looking for opportunities it’s worth trying to understand where Starbucks lost ground and why Luckin is succeeding.

Starbucks has numerous disadvantages in China: 

-  Starbucks stores are largely in high-tier cities, so when Covid struck and these cities were being shut down, so too were more Starbucks. While Luckin Coffee does have stores in high-tier cities, they've largely targeted lower-tier cities. Major problem for Starbucks.

- Prior to Covid, Starbucks didn't have a well developed App for order and delivery. Luckin already did. So while Starbucks was playing catch-up, Luckin was expanding and building market share. Major problem for Starbucks.

- Starbucks stores are larger and designed to have a ""3rd space"". Luckin stores are small and efficiently designed for pick-up and delivery. So not only is Starbucks paying more for their real-estate but it costs more money and time to create a new store. In other words, Starbucks can't keep up with Luckin's growth, both in speed and the cost of development. Major problem for Starbucks.

- Luckin's selection of drinks cater more to Chinese tastes.

- Luckin is vertically integrated in China so they can reduce their prices and still profit.  Starbucks is seen as a luxury brand, so they can't reduce their prices too much without losing their identity as a luxury brand.

Over a year ago Luckin passed Starbucks in store count, now they've passed them in revenue.

What can't be forgotten is China's unique marketplace for coffee. It is literally the fastest growing coffee market in the world. In Starbucks entire history, they have never opened the number of stores Luckin has in one year - even globally! This isn't a knock on Starbucks, they deserve a great deal of credit for helping to develop the global coffee market, but the western coffee market is a mature one, and slow growing.  Meanwhile in China, things are just getting started.

Some of what I've listed above Starbucks might be able to fix, but not all of it. Going forward, I believe Starbucks will continue to lose market share to Luckin Coffee, making Luckin the better investment for investors.",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16gmwf3/why_starbucks_is_losing_to_luckin_coffee_in_china/,wallstreetbets

As a majority shareholder.

Is it just me or does this seem obvious? He doesn't actually have to go through with it, and the price will drop at that time if he doesn't. Plenty of people are investing believing that they are going to get that $54.20 return back (at minimum, what's the downside right?). This leaves him with an opportunity to pump and sell off before saying ""nvm""' and fucking over the rest of the stockholders... I find it kind of bizarre that he posted the offer and that a law firm approved it (assuming he consulted anyone about the legality lol).

I'll list these specific laws (including Pump & Dump ofc):

>Cornering (the market) – purchasing enough of a particular stock, commodity, or other asset to gain control of the supply and be able to set the price for it.

This post is to offer a different perspective. Hopefully offering contrarian opinions is something that's still allowed on this sub.

1. You really don't feel that going from about $38 to more than $400 in a week is a short squeeze?
2. If you are one of those people that compares to VW, then...wouldn't Cohen joining the board be the catalyst? And, go look at the charts for yourself but instead of looking at screenshots here, ZOOM OUT on both charts. Looks like a short squeeze to me.
3. There was no evidence before GME of Robinhood having a desire to screw over retail investors. The CEO is a millenial...that's not their thing.
4. What there IS evidence of, is incompetence. Doesn't it seem more likely that the brokerage with a crayon interface that once allowed UNLIMITED FUCKING MARGIN simply didn't have the liquidity to handle something like this? And that the CEO is a fucking dumbass who didn't want to admit it on national tv?
5. Why would Citadel even need to pressure Robinhood to begin with? They could have easily seen this coming and prepared for it.
6. If you still believe Citadel was behind this, then RH isn't even the 'enemy' in this scenario anyway. It'd be the DTCC that ultimately made the decision to raise margins to 100%.
7. If you feel that Melvin was lying about covering their position when they actually didn't, then the silver lining is that this is blatant, obvious, and easily disproven. They ARE being investigated; So this would come out and it'd be a big fucking deal. Which makes me doubt they'd lie about something they have no ability to cover up.
8. You really should go look at other subs once in a while: Stocks, Stockmarket, Pennystocks, and Options. Contrarian opinions are allowed there. If nothing else, isn't more information before you make a financial decision a good thing?

Disclosure: I've had multiple positions on GME. Bought calls and puts, bought shares, sold covered calls using both shares and LEAPS as leverage. I made a lot of mistakes during the run, but have come out so far with about 150% profit (could have been over 1000% if I played it a lot better)",32,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfe7rn/robinhood_colluding_with_citadel_to_halt_buying/,wallstreetbets

ryqgub,2022-01-08 03:43:08,Moderna is probably the most vulnerable COVID vaccine company right now and why an aggressive short might make sense.,"Moderna is the example of a small company that has its entire wealth built around one thing: mRNA COVID vaccines. Before COVID, this company was on the brink of bankruptcy. As COVID vaccines reveal themselves to be much less efficacious that initially marketed and as Moderna vaccines are said to induce pretty severe side effects notably (see recommendations against it for young males in Europe), I see a potential aggressive short in this stock for 2022. They have a great ally though, and it's one of their patent holder: Anthony Fauci. But Fauci might become a handicap in the future for his potential role into gain of function research in China, his lies to Congress and his conflict of interests that absolutely no one can ignore. His fall into total disgrace might just be a matter of time (hopefully) and might drag Moderna with it. I could see the CEO progressively trying to exit. The dominoes might fall very quickly if it happens.
On the other side, the risk to the upside still exist. Moderna might manage to push other types of vaccines (cancer? other illnesses?) after its success in the COVID vaccines industry. Fauci might also manage to drag his possible prosecutions and remember, he has powerful allies himself.
Pfizer is another element to take into account. Moderna's main rival has a potential safe exit: their treatment named Paxlovid. Once Paxlovid is confirmed to be able to flood the world with a high price tag, Pfizer might not see the current vaccine propaganda to be as useful.
Another threat to Moderna is the actual development of a variant resistant vaccine. An example: https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2021/12/us-army-creates-single-vaccine-effective-against-all-covid-sars-variants/360089/

Let this be a warning to all STOP PUTTING ALL FAITH INTO THE HIVE MIND AND DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. GME is clearly on SEC's ""failure to deliver list"" on every day provided meaning they are still most likely being shorted, but AMC is apparently cleared after the 12th meaning they are probably no longer being shorted.

SEC Site - [https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)

January 4th - AMC - 111,844 shares @ $2.12

January 5th - AMC - 1,631,091 shares @ $2.01

January 7th - AMC - 4,241,943 shares @ $2.01

January 8th - AMC - 11,547,981 shares @ $2.05

January 9-12th - AMC not on list

January 12th - AMC - 5900 shares @ $2.20

January 13-14th - AMC - not on list

I can see where the HYPE was coming from because apparently there was a failure to deliver 4M+ then 11M+ shares, but after that it looks like the ""shorters"" went on to short a much smaller supply. I guess there is still a possibility that the shorting continued, but I am having serious doubts. For those of you holding AMC, you might want to check into my claims to see that you and I got royally fucked. It's clearly not too big of a deficit if you need to sell, but you might want to sell if you have any profit left! unless you hold on to your shares with very little evidence of a future squeeze/potential (probably none). Maybe you'd like to hold onto until AMC becomes what they used to be (if that's possible), which I think I might do considering I bought in at 13 a piece. Anyway, hopefully this sparks a little controversy causing people to check my claim. I hope I'm wrong. BTW none of this is financial advise, do what you retards want

mydfv3,2021-04-25 17:48:26,$FSR Bear Update,"Hi! Me again 🌈🐻, if you didn't see my first two posts ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maa6g3/fsr_is_worth_0_a_share/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/melf8c/fsr_updated_price_target_421/)), I have serious doubts about Fisker as a company.   Just wanted to pop back in with a couple updates.  My goal of these posts is to make sure that anyone investing in this company has a full grasp of the risks.  In their 10K that was (finally) filed, I grabbed two important pieces of information that I hadn't really discussed in depth.   I'll try to keep this short this time.

**Manufacturing Agreement:**

First, is that the reported deal with Magna International to manufacture the Ocean is not actually finalized.  It's more of an memorandum of understanding with a basic outline of terms.  So, the clock is ticking on their Q4 2022 production date, and they still don't have detailed terms with the manufacturer.  Who is also supposed to be performing the majority of the engineering, design, and testing of the car itself.

Might want to get moving on that.

**Manufacturing Agreement Terms:**

The terms of the above agreement are that Magna will get a series of warrants for FSR stock that are exerciseable upon three main milestones: (1) preliminary production spec, (2) detailed manufacturing agreement, (3) start of production. If fully exercised, these warrants amount to 6% ownership in Fisker.

Let that sink in.  If Magna produces a single Ocean, they own 6% of the company.  This (maybe?) makes sense for a long term strategic partnership, but Fisker has already announced that they want Foxconn to make their second car.  How much ownership does Foxconn get?  And if they make a third car?  Does everyone just get 6%?  So of course Magna made that deal.  No downside risk, and the upside is 6% of an EV company.

&#x200B;

As I said in a comment on my previous post,  I""ll be keeping an eye on May.  They had announced they'd have a production version of the Ocean ready for the LA Auto Show that was supposed to be in May 2021.  The show has been moved to November (Covid-19), but it will be telling if they debut a production ready Ocean on that original timeline, or if dates are already slipping.

I don't think this company leadership has any idea what it's doing.

lbhwf9,2021-02-03 06:59:27,Are you sure Melvin is still short GME? Because if they're not then you're all just playing with yourselves.,"Hi, former hedge fund trader here. First thing: In my 8 years trading for Wall street firms I never heard of anyone pulling this naked short selling shit like what happened with GME. In fact the only time I ever found myself naked short (accidentally) it was a huge problem, was almost fired, massive apologies to the prime broker, exchange, regulators etc. I certainly didn't make that mistake again. I can tell you that in Europe and Asia this kind of shit just doesn't fly. However, having seen the GME fail-to-deliver data on the SEC website, I'm pretty shocked that US markets appear to be riddled with corruption.

Second thing: If you're a trader or PM in a hedge fund and you mess something up then it is the golden rule that you get out immediately. You never let an error run or dilly-dally before making things right. It's my belief that this attitude permeates the entire industry. Ego, right or wrong, fair or unfair, they all go out the window and you take the loss, suffer the pain, and live to fight another day. 

Now let's consider what happened last week: GME  traded > 500m shares. If Melvin were covering at 1/4 volume it means they could have bought 125m shares. That's twice the floating market cap. As such I'd say Melvin is almost certainly out of this trade already.

In that case, you're all just playing with yourselves and the selloffs are a simple result of derivative brokers (eToro et al) running stops of leveraged customers. The only way to fix this is for retail to stop buying GME derivatives and instead buy real stock and hold.

Happy to hear any evidence that they're still short but beware the integrity of such data.

1baeb7i,2024-03-09 09:57:11,Why do people seem unconcerned about the bull run ending?," 

I'm beginning to see more and more signs of an impending crash, both in the stock market and beyond. It's possible that we are heading towards a crash of unprecedented proportions. I don't want to sound like those doomsday preachers with a bell in hand who once heralded the end of the world, but I increasingly feel that way as clear signs of something brewing are evident, and people seem to be blatantly ignoring it.

Let me start with the most obvious factor – everything is incredibly expensive. After analyzing numerous companies using traditional methods, I couldn't find a reasonably valued stock. The S&P500 has surpassed its all-time high many times since the beginning of the year, and the chart is beginning to resemble a vertical wall. The entire market relies on NVIDIA, driven by AI and colossal expectations associated with it. The Shiller P/E ratio for the S&P500 (comparing the price of the S&P500 to the average annual earnings on S&P500 shares for the last 10 years adjusted for inflation) is at the same level as before the crash in 1929, and if it continues to rise, it will soon reach a level close to the crash of 2000/2001. People are buying stocks without asking, ""at what price?""

Another factor is the real estate market, which has never been so inflated. I'm not an expert, but when the whole world talks about how expensive houses are, and people take out loans based on very high interest rates, thinking it won't get any cheaper, it starts to scare me. Of course, I'm not afraid that houses will become cheaper, but rather what might cause it.

Next up are cryptocurrencies, whose recent rapid surges, in my opinion, signify the best indicator that the end of prosperity is near. The market is already so inflated that even the riskiest assets are gaining momentum at a very rapid pace.

I would also like to mention Warren Buffett's recent annual letter. Berkshire Hathaway currently has $167 billion in cash. When asked about his plans for it, Buffett replied, ""I plan to wait."" He added that financial markets can ""unpredictably stop and even disappear,"" as has happened in the past, and Berkshire, with its cash reserves, has the ""ability to respond"" to market downturns, which could be a ""great opportunity"" for the company. I get the impression that Buffett, too, expects a major crash but is hesitant to talk about it to avoid alarming less aware investors in his fund.

Lastly, I've saved my biggest concern for the end – the specter of a third world war. As mentioned by a politician, if someone at a European summit were to mention the possibility of World War III in the past, their career would quickly come to an end. However, now it is one of the main topics at summit meetings. I fear that this could be the reason for the crash I'm talking about.",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1baeb7i/why_do_people_seem_unconcerned_about_the_bull_run/,wallstreetbets

Where did Tesla go wrong? The once red-hot electric automaker was considered to be a part of the Magnificent Seven, a collection of behemoth tech stocks with some pretty recognizable names. Now? Tesla is considered to be one of the worst-performing stocks of the entire S&P 500 during a time where we are seeing some of the highest highs in the market. 

Well, fasten your seatbelts because here we go:

1. Tesla is **plagued** with serious [***safety issues***](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMTEvY2Fycy9pbnN1cmFuY2UtZ3JvdXAtcmF0ZXMtdGVzbGEtYXV0b3BpbG90LXNhZmV0eS9pbmRleC5odG1sP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9d3d3LmJsYWNrc3dhbnN0cmVldC5jb20mdXRtX21lZGl1bT1yZWZlcnJhbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249dGVzbGEtdHVtYmxlcy1mdXJ0aGVyLXdpbGwtYW55dGhpbmctc3RvcC1pdHMtZmFsbCIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiIzMWVhOGIxNC0xZDdkLTQ1NjctODI5Yi1iZmExMWU0ODU3NjQiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6IjdlZjVjMmQ1LTE2MmMtNDc0ZS1hZmM3LTM0YWI3NDE0OTU3ZCIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiZWJjYjk2ZTctZTcyMC00MTU4LTlhNjEtMGJlM2Y1NThhYWI1IiwiaWF0IjoxNzExNjM3OTY0LCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.Tpdvt-jAIe_I8-9QnzJZmLhLeUilgPpcDKITbuSynNs), and [***recalls***](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.ftigiCnGk_zcjROdkF7MayV8MYmsluH2LIKmNORV17c) have caused the electric giant to **slash** its car prices even more than it already has. 
2. The electric vehicle industry as a whole is becoming more **crowded** than ever before at the absolute **worst time** for the company, just as its fundamentals are coming into question. To date the company's share price has dropped more than **60%** from its 2021 all-time high of $407.
3. This cramped competition can be realized even further with the fact that China’s electric vehicle champion, BYD, has **overtaken** Tesla as the **largest** EV producer in the world, with a 22% increase in global sales for Q4 of last year, surpassing Tesla by over 41,000 units. This is bad news for Tesla as it begins to lose its **foothold** over the Asian region even further as its ***gap*** over the Chinese rival decreased from 400,000 units posted in 2022 to 230,000 units posted in 2023.
4. After **missing** expectations on the company's reported earnings earlier this year, it has become apparent that demand for electric vehicles has **declined** and is notably lower than last year. The company seems to be **stuck** between two major growth phases as it works on launching its next-generation vehicles. We can only hope that those new cars don’t have any major issues as the current generation of vehicles does; otherwise, Tesla could spiral into an even deeper rabbit hole than it currently is.

My high school classmates voted me ""Most Likely to Lose Virginity at a Massage Parlor in Thailand."" Please see below my thoughts on the (rather niche) meme stock Bed Bath & Beyond, which trades on the Nasdaq as $BBBY.

**Preface**

I'll admit it. I was initially drawn to this stock by nostalgia. I remember roaming these wide fluorescent aisles as a wonderstruck child, holding my mother's hand and nibbling on a Pokemon card. I remember the smells of the exotic lotions and the textures of the plush towels. It was pure opulence.

But wankery and nostalgia aside, it is my not-so-humble opinion that there are many, many reasons why this stock is a compelling gamble.

&#x200B;

* **Fresh Faces and Fresher Ideas**
   * The entire C-Suite was overhauled in 2020. The CEO was hired in November 2019, and literally every other exec was hired in 2020. They are not fucking around
   * 100% of the Board of Directors were appointed within the last 4 years
   * All the boomers that milked this company dry as it spiraled downward are gone
* **Shawty Got Techniques**
   * The new C-Suite is packed with Retail veterans with specific experience leading digital/e-commerce transformations. These are alumni from the likes of Target, Amazon, Nordstrom, Home Depot, Walgreens, Walmart, J. Crew, and Disney -- companies that have been set up exceptionally well to survive the 21st Century. There's also a Chief Digital Officer now
   * A quick browse of their job openings show just ambitious the turnaround really is. Open positions include cloud engineers, digital marketers, and warehouse fulfillment staff. They are also hiring beaucoup data scientists to mine consumer insights and optimize their supply chain
* **Omnipresent AF**
   * The website is officially an online shop, and has UI/UX for days. They even have an app you can shop with. Only the best of the best retailers have apps, it is known
   * They do all the things that multi-channel retailers should do, like same day delivery, store and curbside pickup, and free shipping on orders over $39
   * Wedding and baby registries. Let's face it, these are a social institution that aren't going away. $BBBY is one of the rare few retailers that offers pretty much everything a newly wed couple or a newborn might need

&#x200B;

* **A Structured Roadmap with Annual Milestones**
   * The $BBBY transformation is not just a bunch of buzzwords thrown into a vague vision statement. Management is executing on a 3-Year Roadmap that involves cutting costs by going lean and prioritizing investments in digital penetration
   * It's working: Gross margins increased from 26.7% to 34.9% over the past year. Digital penetration of sales revenue increased from 18% in FY18Q1 to 38% in FY21Q1
   * Demonstrated results are real, unlike the castles in the sky that speculative SPACs promise

&#x200B;

* **An Iconic Brand Seared Into The American Subconscious**
   * This bullet speaks for itself really. You and everyone you know has heard of $BBBY. $BBBY is love. $BBBY is life.
* **Taking the Shitty Horses Behind the Barn and Shooting Them. Running the Litty Horses in the Races**
   * Aggressively selling underperforming business units such as Cost Plus World Market, One Kings Lane, and PMall
   * Aggressively growing overperforming business units such as Buybuy Baby, Harmon, and Decorist
   * Aggressively investing in the cash cows that are private label brands. Retailers from CostCo to Amazon know how fucking milkable private label brands are for juiced revenues, especially when they're sharing shelf space with more established brands. After all, you are who you spend time with. $BBBY have launched 3 of these brands so far this year, with plans to launch 3 more next quarter. They are aiming for 30% private label sales penetration by FY23
* **The ESG Boost**
   * Publicly committed to net zero emissions by 2040
   * Investing heavily in water efficiency, waste recycling, and sustainable and responsible sourcing throughout their supply chain
   * They are also investing in diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace. This is coming from the top-down, because 7 out of 13 board directors are women and 5 out of 8 C-Suite execs are women and/or BIPOC. ESG investors lap this kinda shit up. Also a McKinsey study found that businesses who outperformed industry peers on racial and ethnic diversity were also statistically likely to outperform financially
   * The recent boom in impact investing, combined with social pressures on institutional investors, has definitely boosted demand for ESG-oriented stocks. $BBBY is well-positioned to benefit from this trend
* **Financials**
   * Positive, growing EBITDA
   * Extremely healthy cash position of $1.35 Billion. Long-term debt of $1.19B is lower
   * Free cash flow and operating cash flow are positive and trending upwards. Very bullish
   * Net income has been negative in recent years but was finally positive in the trailing twelve months. As a result net income margin and operating margin are still relatively low (although positive)
   * Current ratio of 1.56 is very healthy
   * Management is confident enough to regularly buy back shares. They clearly care about their shareholders. They used to pay a dividend before COVID as well, but it is not clear if/when this will be reinstated
* **Potential Catalysts**
   * A huge catalyst this summer is college shopping as in-person attendance picks up. Thanks to COVID, essentially 2+ years worth of students will be moving out from their parents' place and into college for the first time
   * The turnaround may be a 3 year plan, but investors will continue to reward the stock as long as management keeps meeting milestones.
   * All in all, keep an eye out for FY21Q2 earnings in a couple months. Could see a major move upward. I plan to build out my position by then
   * If inflation is indeed not transitory, and we are headed for a market downturn, people are still going to buy pillows and blankets and shit. Consumer cyclical stocks are good during inflation

**The Bear Case**

Unlike certain bag holders on this sub (cough cough CLOV CLNE WISH cough cough), I can admit that this is definitely a gamble. This is not a sure thing. Upside could be limited, because big money investors are starting to be bullish on the turnaround too.

And, of course, the turnaround may fall flat. Amazon exists. Retail/e-commerce is a dog fuck dog world, and Amazon is bigass dog in a smallass doggy day care. Revenue is on a long-term downtrend, and management is yet to demonstrate that they can surpass the performance from the brick and mortar glory days of yore.

Also, my credibility is suspect. I'm emotional, impulsive, and honestly -- despite my obvious and staggering genius -- I do a lot of dumb shit. So don't just take my word on this. Follow your heart.

gf3bpf,2020-05-07 09:24:06,Why the next leg down will happen and why it will be soon,"tldr; The virus is a laboratory construct and when the masses find out it will cause another wave of panic.

&#x200B;

I first want to start by saying I'm an autist and not a geneticist or have a degree in bioinformatics. If you want to read the a good source that you can use for your own dd here you go: [https://medium.com/@yurideigin/lab-made-cov2-genealogy-through-the-lens-of-gain-of-function-research-f96dd7413748](https://medium.com/@yurideigin/lab-made-cov2-genealogy-through-the-lens-of-gain-of-function-research-f96dd7413748)

&#x200B;

But let's be honest, most of the words in that article are more the two syllables and you guys won't get passed the first couple paragraphs so I'll summarize the most important parts.

&#x200B;

Sars-Cov-2 is a chimera (genetic splicing of different viruses/organisms)

It is 96% identical to Bat corona-virus RaTG13. Most of the differences are found in the Receptor-Binding Motif (RBM). This is the RNA that is responsible to make the S2 Glyco-protein (the thing that attaches to the ace2 receptor to infect your cells). 

If you just look at just the RBM Sars-Cov-2 is almost identical to a Pangolin Corona virus MP789 from Guangdong.

&#x200B;

The things I just told you are all known by the public. The consensus that is being publicly spoken about is that these two virus or mutated variations of them infected the same host in the wet market in Wuhan and through genetic recombination created the BatSoup Virus we have today. Which would absolutely be possible. But here is where is gets fucked.... 

&#x200B;

Lady's (maybe...) and Autists I present to you the smoking gun...

https://preview.redd.it/szgz695e4bx41.png?width=1132&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5339c11500b523929869753543703302866140

That image is an amino acid (AA) comparison between all 3 viruses. Each letter represents a different AA. The red letters are where the AA's are different between the strains being compared. The smoking gun is the highlighted four AA series PRRA. Underneath that are 4 red stars indicating an insertion. While this can happen naturally, it is highly unlikely this is the case. Especially since this little 4 AA insertion is incredibly important and the reason why Sars-Cov-2 is highly transmissible.

&#x200B;

The amino acid after PRRA is R. This forms the sequence RRAR. RRAR is what is called a polybasic ferin cleavage site. Ferin is a special molecule in our bodies and it goes around and finds these site and cuts the amino acid chain at the cleavage site. Now the author goes into detail on the mechanisms but i don't really understand it. Basically it makes the virus highly transmissible and virulent. 

&#x200B;

Adding these cleavage sites is very common in Gain of Function research. Where scientist make virus more functional in human models to anticipate future threats and make therapeutics to counter these phenomena. My theory is that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was playing around in the lab and forgot to clean their shoes and this got out accidentally. When the Chinese found out they tried to keep it a secret and that's how it spread world-wide.

&#x200B;

This is the evidence that trump has been talking about about this virus coming from a lab. If I found this in between jerking off and being a degenerate on Robinhood then it's only a matter of time before it's on every news station around the world. That's when the next leg down starts.

&#x200B;

Panic will set in again after this comes out and the virus tears us a new one when we start to open up again. This is what will give the bears their strength.

&#x200B;

Don't let the mods delete this. Save it and repost if I get banned. The truth needs to come out.

10cwyst,2023-01-15 22:26:51,Is TSLA a buy?,"Two years ago, it was pretty clear that Tesla was overvalued. Its P/E ratio was significantly higher than its competitors. In fact, the company was worth more than General Motors, Ford, and Toyota combined. Tesla seemed poised to eventually compete with the established automakers but investors seemed to think that Tesla would eventually become a monopoly. Tesla did better than expected in 2020 but it seemed like investors overshot the new reality. And it seems like I was right to be fearful when investors were greedy on TSLA.

From two years ago, the stock has gone down by 58.27%. The P/E ratio is now 37.78. The thing to note about Tesla is that it's really a tech stock and it should be treated as such. Tech stocks tend to have higher P/E ratios because investors anticipate higher revenue growth. Another thing worth noting is that while the stock price has fallen, earnings have gone up. In 2020, Tesla made roughly $31.5 billion with $6.6 billion in gross profit and just under $2 billion in operating income. Over the past 12 months, Tesla has made $74.8 billion in revenue, $19.9 in gross profit, and $12.5 billion in operating income. The P/E ratio is much higher in Tesla than its competitors which is 2-10. However, compared to other tech companies, Tesla is rather tame. Amazon is at 89.2. Even its competitor, Walmart, is at 44.7.

Tesla has much higher growth potential than its competitors, being a first mover in electric vehicles. Its competitors are largely well established and are not growing as quickly as Tesla. Tesla has already established itself as an EV brand. The question is whether its competitors can make the switch towards electric vehicles to hold their own against Tesla.",0,0.46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10cwyst/is_tsla_a_buy/,wallstreetbets
ovrkt5,2021-08-01 12:52:56,China is playing the long-game; US is running on band-aids,"China is not trying to kill their big tech, they are trying to make their business models more long-lived and sustainable both financially and socially.

It is definitely trying hard to create a more conservative financial system while contributing to a more equal distribution of wealth. Say what you want, but that ain't bad news at all if you're a long term investor.

China wants to rely less on foreign fund flows because they see high speculation and bubble activity in Western countries and they don't want their domestic companies to be exposed to that euphoria and collapse risk. It's easy for a company to act recklessly in such an environment, and these reckless acts might ruin the Government's efforts towards a stable and healthy growing market.

Remember, China is a country lead by a collectivist mindset where the good of the mass is more important than the good of a single company or individual (which will frequently lead to abuse of the few for the many, in direct opposition to the policy of the US government which easily sacrifices the many for the few on top (not so much Western Europe). In the end the collective good turns out to be the company's best interest too.

They are not oblivious to the effects these measures have on the markets, even going as far as to post ads on the front page of every newspaper claiming that they are not in any way trying to harm tech companies, but actually helping them become more sustainable and resilient.

&#x200B;

Was the crackdown on education stocks really a surprise?

In April the government released a document analyzing the education system of the country and already pointing out the problems they saw and possible corrective measures.

If somebody read those (and they should have if they owned the companies) they could have anticipated the sector to be caught in the regulation crossfire. But people don't do their due diligence and always act surprised when things go south. China is always clear about its intentions, we're just unable to understand them because we keep thinking in Western terms and taking our society and the companies we know as the ""default"" condition, which is fundamentally wrong.

Was the crackdown on Didi a surprise too?

Absolutely not. The government had explicitly recommended Didi delayed their IPO until certain data issues had been dealt with. Their main concern was making sure data breaches were avoided since, well, the US is literally their main competitor.

Didi ignored all this and went ahead. What followed was more than expected.

&#x200B;

I'm not pretending their totalitarian government that seeks to have absolute control over everything and every piece of information and conducts ethnic cleansing is in any way the most advanced form of human governance.

I'm simply pointing out that it is doing what it is doing because it wants to secure a strong and steady growth for its companies, and it knows that can only be achieved if it does not come at the expense of impoverishing its population and compromising healthy competition and fair-play in all sectors.

Only the western investor deeply embroiled in never-ending ATH's and euphoria can view the sustainable long-term measures as unsustainable and the unsustainable short-term bandaids as sustainable.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Now this is what I call a controversial fucking post. I guess time will tell.

I wrote an article 2 months ago about why WSB was running the equity markets. I explained how the rise of passive investing (ala Mike Green's thesis) was making it so that the marginal mover of capital was entirely passive, and this is leading to a war between retail (WSB) and hedge funds for the valuation of markets and basically the winner gets to lead the sheep (the passive money). It explains the massive run-up of Tesla/Nio and the endless bids from the likes of vanguard funds once they reach certain market cap hurdles. I won't go into this in depth. Those who wish to find out more should read my previous post and go look up Mike Green from Logica. 

I won't go into details on the gamma convexity squeeze dynamics, and how it is enhancing a lot of momentum and creating feedback loops, for those who want to read more, I would recommend Chris Cole of Artemis capital to talked about this dynamic in the podcast **End Game** with Grant William.

This time around, I will talk about two misconceptions of the market surrounding GME. I will talk about why attacking hedge funds like they are part of the establishment is also pretty misguided. And I will will go over my thoughts on what will happen next.  

**GME Misconceptions**

The two misconceptions on GME have to do with manipulation of GME shares by the brokers and that they are having to do this because the short sellers are trapped in an infinite money black hole. The problem with this narrative is that it ignores some fundamental understanding about how buying shares work. The prevention of GME buying really has nothing to do with market manipulation in collusion with Citadel or Melvin or any market makers. The fact is that the market makers are running trillion dollar flow books and couldn't care less, and Robinhood is not a broker for any hedge funds. The real reason is that some of these smaller brokers don't have enough working capital to fund the required collateral by clearing houses (which was raised on them over the past few days), this is why the largest guys like Fidelity didn't have that issues. Which is why many brokers are drawing down their banking lines (such as Robinhood drawing down $1 billion from banks). Once they bring on enough liquidity, they will enable them again, but until then, we still live in a T+2 settlement world in which brokers have working capital needs. The implementation was retarded, but the brokers basically panicked when they saw their working capital deplete rapidly.

The other misconception has to do with WSB finding in infinite money wormhole. Trust me, I was there when a relative value Fund I interned at in 2009 basically went bust when a short selling ban was implemented. I was there when the Italian banks were on the verge of collapse, sitting on my 10x delta puts with a seven figure paper profit as a 26 year old when Draghi announced LTRO and blew my portfolio up. There are a lot of things that would stop the infinitely money machine, especially if you have been around long enough and have seen all the games being played. One such way is that management can simply issues new shares (likely through a privately placement deal with the short seller consortium), and the likelihood goes up the more the price goes up. Another way is that the SEC could step in and put a short term trading halt while forcing the short sellers into a deal with mgt. 

**Misplaced Hatred of Hedge Funds**

If one looks around the financial landscape today, Hedge funds are actually a dying breed. The young put about 80% of their capital to work in passive while the boomers that are exiting have historically placed about 80% of their capital to work in active funds. As a result, since about  2008, active managers such as mutual funds and hedge funds had actually been dying, even though they played almost no role during the 2008 GFC. If anything, many hedge funds identified problems in the system way earlier and most of the people in the big short were successful hedge fund managers. The problem was that the rise in passive and the fed had manipulated price signals so much so that one cannot actually make money arbitraging value (long undervalued, short overvalued) in a world less and less flow cares about value. 

The narrative being promoted by those who do not understand markets is that these evil hedge funds were shorting stocks, bankrupting companies and forcing layoffs. This could not be further from the truth. The value of a share in a secondary market has no impact on the day to day business of a company. A company could trade at 0 value, but if it generates healthy profits and has a strong balance sheet, it will keep going, hiring people and expanding. The truth is that these ""evil"" hedge funds were managing long short books. They were owning things like Facebook, Apple or it could be distressed debt they thought were undervalued, they were hedging their long book with things they think could go bust in the event of an economic downturn/crisis. 

**What Happens Next**

The effects of the GME short squeeze should not be underestimated, not because of the money lost by shorts on its position of somewhere around $20 billion (that's peanuts in financial markets terms). The full ramification is actually on the long side, from hedge funds who no longer feel like they can hedge out their downside by shorting fundamental unsound companies. I would not be surprised if the action in the markets in the past several days is just the beginning of large unwind because hedge funds will have to now reduce their risk position in their longs, the ramification of which will be in the hundreds of billions to trillions. It could very well be that this de-risking by active managers will lead to the start of a larger correction in the broader market. And as we have seen during the March selloff, without active managers who have cash on their books, who are the buyer of last resort, but instead passive flow, who actually tend to go bid-less in a market crash, we could see increasing volatility the likes we have never seen before. 

If the market does crash, congress may blame this on ""reckless speculators"" and ban option trading for those under certain income/networth thresholds. just as hedge funds are being scapegoated for 2008 despite being innocent, retail may be scapegoated for the next crash despite the real driver of volatility being the rise of passive money. The lack of retail participation in options may mean that he gamma squeeze dynamics will end. 

I have taken off most of my long positions and am sitting on cash and reloading VIX calls and some weekly ATM SPX puts.  Congraduations, you autists have beaten hedge funds (who are more like whales being hunted to extinction than fierce sharks) in the first major battle, but have set yourself to lose one of your most important tools (gamma squeeze). I would suggest taking out your gains and buying downside protection, maybe you'll gamma squeeze the market into a 50% correction and turn yourself into a high-net-worth (HNW) so you can bypass any future retail restrictions.",97,0.57,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qx8p/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/,wallstreetbets

People view $AMC the same way they view $GME - just another brick & mortar Mall company that is essentially being destroyed by $AMZN Prime, HBO Max, and Disney+. Fair enough, but I enjoy watching a new release in IMAX with a flatbread pizza in one hand, and a flavored Coke in my other. I think many others do to.

To address everyone who doesn't care about IMAX or going to theaters, $AMC has to simply do ONE VERY SIMPLE THING that will literally blow the minds of the un-imaginative analysts who are predicting doom.  All $AMC has to do is rename ""**AMC Theatres On Demand**"", the program they started in 2019, to **AMC+**.

AMC+ will be a studio-independant platform for movies, documentaries and TV shows. No monthly fee, but rather an revenue-sharing a la carte pricing system. Of course I'd love to see $AMC poach some talent from $NFLX or $DIS when they announce AMC+. One can dream!

TL;DR- $AMC can pivot hard by simply relaunching their existing ""AMC Theatres On Demand"" to AMC+.

l90vcc,2021-01-31 01:13:58,GME devil's advocate,"Alright, this is going to be brutal on karma. I'm confident this will get downvoted to hell, but fuck it.

Early GME holders (people who bought <$50 or so), you can keep walking. You're all most likely safe and will profit from your holdings and trades.

People who're buying GME at current levels, maybe I'll be completely wrong and you'll make a million and cash out at the top and lose nothing... or maybe, I'll be right and it will be loss porn galore for days. I'm leaning towards the second.

**Here's why,**

GME is trading at a ridiculous premium, short squeeze or not, gamma squeeze or not. If you're buying in now, you might see a few days, or even a few weeks worth of green that will be life-changing... but most of you will end up losing to an enemy you don't even think you're playing against. I'll explain this in a bit.

Right now, the general public and especially WSB consensus is that GME is going to keep squeezing because of 100%+ short interest, and that's a fundamentally valid reason, but those who are buying these GME shares, where do you think they're coming from? Here's a hint.

Initially, Melvin and Shitron were the primary shorters. They shorted the stock around $10 or so, thus making their max profit $10/share if GME had gone bankrupt. But as you keep squeezing higher, and even worse, as you keep buying at higher prices... Though Melvin and Shitron would be forced to close positions with hefty losses (I say would because I don't know for a fact that they already have despite what CNBC says), many other hedge funds would've opened new ones. Now, why the fuck would they do that? Simple, you gave them an opportunity to short a stock that was worth $10 a few months back, and is now 30x that... raising potential returns by at least 30x. Of course, the stock doesn't even have to go back to $10, even at $50 or $100 newly opened shorts would see sizable returns, and the only people who get truly hurt will be the ones who longed at these ridiculous levels.

Think about it., who do you think keeps lending out more shares to the retail investor? New hedge funds who previously had no skin in the game, or had a very small position at best!!! You don't think you're playing against them, but you are. The energy and focus seem so concentrated on Melvin and the gang that you don't even realize there are vultures waiting for a complete bloodbath.

Eventually, time will come when profit-seekers (with long positions) will begin entering the market, or when retail investors would've exhausted their capital and the price will come tumbling down faster than gravity taking hold of vulture shit falling from the sky. It will be a matter of a few thousand shares entering and the domino effect will bring it all down in a matter of days, maybe even hours.

The fuck am I trying to say? Well, I'm not advocating for a liquidation here, and neither am I telling you to stop buying. That decision is yours to make with the information you gather. All I'm saying is look around for more enemies as prices keep skyrocketing. You, the retail investor, are walking through the valley of beasts with every intention to make the rich bastards pay, but just know, there are a lot more of them gathering around this battle with each $ GME goes up... and not a single one of them stands agnostic, they've all got a bet open and it's most likely against you at these levels. This is becoming as much an opportunity of a lifetime on the short side, as it was on the long side when the stock was in single digits.

A lot of you are pushing the whole SLV Citadel conspiracy theory. If anyone talks about why silver is a good play they get called a hedge fund bot trying to distract from GME.

Maybe you people calling silver a scam are the real Citadel shills. I mean, you are distracting from GME and you are trying to allocate funds to stocks that Citadel has calls in. It seems like some of you are just pushing the tickers you have positions in.

This means that the company is worth half of it was which doesn't add up, because that would mean its growth would be cut in half which still yet doesn't make sense since its a value stock.

&#x200B;

Since its a value stock we now can assume that HALf of its value is no longer there which is NOT the case for FB as Revenue will seemingly never go down to far much rather the company will keep moving by increasing what the organization does, such as the metaverse and purchasing start up's. The main problem that has happened is a small decrease in daily users which makes sense because they already have half of the human population on the app, so we can expect seeing not as much huge new users incoming, and expect more expansion of the app and the brand it self.

We've seen this before back in 2018 of July where the Company reported bad earnings and the stock went to decrease to almost 40% which almost took it 1 year to recover but the stock never was able to fully recover and grow until january of 2020.

You’d be forgiven for having never heard of JD.com outside of Asia. JD is an online e-commerce company that is largest direct retailer in China.

Why am I bullish?

Well. Let’s do some comparisons against the boomer bae that is Amazon:

Amazon market cap: $1.52T

Amazon revenue 2020: $386bn

Amazon net profit: $21.33bn

JD market cap $130bn

JD revenue 2020: $114bn

JD net profit:$7.59bn

So, in comparison JD is valued x12 less than Amazon but is already generating 1/3 of the revenue and net profits in an online market that is set to expand rapidly over the next decade as more of China gains internet usage. 

Internet usage stats by population:
China: 63%
USA: 96%

Absolute no brainer.

18fiael,2023-12-11 00:55:58,Why the CT is bullish and your feelings don’t matter.,"TLDR: It has better specs than competitors, Tesla is most likely not losing money on it, Tesla will most likely be able to reach 25k production rather fast. 

Ford has had the lightning, Rivian the RT1, and GM technically sells the Hummer but we won’t be including that for obvious reasons. And then there’s CT, the truck everyone on Reddit hates. Although CT is actually the better vehicle in most cases or at the very least comparable. 

**Specs**

Range: RT1 wins by ~15 miles, while Ford is far behind. 

Towing cap: RT1 and CT tie

Rivian and Tesla are pretty neck and neck for most “truck specs” like towing, torque, HP. But Tesla has a larger bed capacity at 2,500lbs vs Rivians 1,760lbs. 

Price: There are no outliers, all have comparable price options. Ford has the lowest priced option, but it has far lower specs than what we’re comparing. 

Cargo: CT wins by 20% given it comes stock with a lockable bed. But it has comparable storage without the bed. It also has the longest bed by almost 6 inches but it’s also the skinniest by 2in. 

Ground clearance: CT wins, Ford is a low rider with almost 10in less than CT. 

CT has better battery efficiency, but the RT1 is extremely aerodynamic. The RT1 is top of the list for aero and overall efficiency. 

Top speed, HP, Bidirectional, are all comparable. Ford being the worst in most cases. 

**CT has many other features that the other two don’t** and they’re cooler than the RT1 gear tunnel. Steer by wire, is not new tech but it’s new to trucks and iirc is only in a handful of vehicles. Reviews are glowing and the industry has been wanting to switch for a while. 

Rear wheel steering, makes the turning radius of CT smaller than the model S. it also helps with merging on highways. 

*800 volt* architecture. This isn’t a new thing but it’s not common and is very important. It means lower current, less wires, more efficient and lighter vehicle. It also means faster charging. The industry has wanted to do this for a while too but hasn’t. Many will follow. This is part of the reason why CT is lighter than both competitors while being covered in steel. 

Also a 48v system vs 12v like most vehicles. This shares similar benefits as above. 

Although it’s kind of a meme, CT also has an extended battery option that sits in the front of the bed similar to a tool box. It’s actually a great deal in terms of onboard battery storage and adds over 100miles of range iirc. Great if you would normally use the truck for its onboard power. 

It’s hardened, scratch proof, and lack of paint will make it great for working conditions. Plus now tesla can’t fuck up your paint on delivery. No more rock chips and you probably won’t ever have to replace any windows, no more smash-n-grabs. 

Infotainment screen in the back seat for passengers. And the largest screen on the market in the front. 

This is somewhat subjective but Fords software and general UI/UX is arguably well below Tesla and Rivian standards. 

Rivian and Tesla both come equipped with advanced cruise control systems. I don’t know much about Rivians capabilities. 

**DD**

I’m sure I’m missing things. But based on specs, the Cybertruck is the better truck. **The issue is the way it looks.** As we’ve seen on Reddit, everyone thinks it looks terrible. Personally I love the way it looks. 

I’m not going to speculate and try and guess how many people might be turned off enough by its looks to not buy it. But we can assume that Tesla will be able to produce a lot of them. Castings are not new to Tesla, these are much larger but even if they’re able to ramp at a fraction of the speed of model Y ramp in Shanghai they’ll be making far more than 100k/year soon. Tesla has said it is possible to hit 250k in two years. 

GM isint in this conversation because they can’t make anything with a battery, Ford only made 15k last year and rivian made 25k. Both companies are losing a massive amount of money on every sale. 

Tesla did say they’d sell CT at a loss if needed, which would imply Tesla isn’t in a loss yet. But given all the new tech I find it a little hard to believe they’re making much on the $80k trim. They’d most likely lose money selling their low trim currently, which would explain why they aren’t selling it. 

With all that said, I strongly believe the CT will be the best selling EV truck rather soon. And will remain there until another more traditional company matches Teslas production.

There’s also a good chance opinions change around its look once more are on roads and other manufacturers make more “radical” looking cars. If this happens there’s little reason to think the CT won’t be a top seller within EV trucks longterm. 

Overall I always thought CT would be great for the company and stock, and after seeing its spec I still feel the same way. 

If I’ve made any mistakes in my comparison please point it out.",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18fiael/why_the_ct_is_bullish_and_your_feelings_dont/,wallstreetbets
vs6zsw,2022-07-05 20:12:28,"Stefan Semanov, up $50m from GME shorts.","[The face of evil](https://ibb.co/Kr0Qn6q)

>”Apes are poor and stupid” -Stefan Semanov

**Backstory:**

Semanov studied philosophy under Karl Popper at the Russian School of Economics, but he abandoned his plans to become a philosopher. He joined the London merchant bank Singer & Friedlander. In 1976 he moved to New York City, where he worked initially as an analyst of European securities and rapidly made his mark.

**Financial career**

In 1983 Semanov established the Semanov Fund (later Quantos Endowment Fund), a hedge fund that subsequently spawned a range of associated companies. His daring investment decisions caused the funds to grow rapidly, but not all his gambles succeeded. He correctly foresaw the worldwide stock market crash of October 1987—but wrongly predicted that Japanese stocks would fall hardest of all.

Semanov’s status as an almost mythical financier was established in September 1992 when the British government devalued the pound sterling. Through his Quantum group of companies, Semanov had sold billions of pounds during the days preceding devaluation, much of it purchased with borrowed money. 

Afterward Semanov bought back pounds, repaid the money he had borrowed, and made a profit of about $1 billion. Others also profited from the pound’s fall, but the scale of Semanov’s operations dwarfed those of everyone else, and the gambit earned him the nickname “the man who broke the Bank of Russia.” In 1994, however, his instincts appeared to fail him—at least temporarily—as he speculated that the dollar would rise in value against the Japanese yen. Instead, the dollar fell all year, and the Quantum Fund reportedly lost hundreds of millions on a single day in February.

**CURRENT:**

Latest 13F filings show that Semanov has taken a rather large short position against $GME, to the sum of **$100,000,000**, of which he is currently up $50m.

But that’s not all - he has many ties to BCG, and has made the bulk of his fortune shorting companies into bankruptcy (Radioshack, Toys R Us, Blockbuster are the three most noteworthy) and his portfolio now has both GME and BBBY shorts, aswell as some defense stocks (BA, RTX, RBLX.)

Stefan Semanov has made **far more profit** shorting $GME than Citadel. Stefan Semanov is an evil man.

#TL;DR Stefan Semanov is an evil man who is up $50m on $GME shorts

Edit: Shills in the comments are trying to convince you this isn’t Stefan Semanov. It is, the rich and powerful don’t like being brought into the light like this.

nxyi8r,2021-06-12 04:29:10,I have been looking at WWE stock recently and I think it's undervalued right now.,"https://i.lensdump.com/i/ZgNacv.jpg

Covid and the absence of the top star, Becky Lynch had an affect on the stock price of WWE. This is a fact. (Refer to linked img)

Wrestlemania 38 is next year's biggest Pay Per View to take place in Texas, the home state of legend and icon, ""Stone Cold Steve Austin"".

For those who don't know who he is or follow wrestling, Austin was the most popular star in all of pro wrestling back in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Rock and Stone Cold had the greatest feuds ever, and their WM matches were legendary and very exciting to watch. Arguably more popular than Hulk Hogan during his 80s and early 90s run, it's safe to say next year the stock of WWE will reach new highs.

Stone Cold will make some sort of return next year, but not as a wrestler since he has been retired since 2003.

Next year will be a large show, since vaccination rates all across the U.S. should be over 70% but likely closer to 90%. This would mean MANY fans will be in attendance. The live shows for the weekly RAW, NXT and SD will bring in lots of money and the stock will clearly rebound.

I also predict by next April, Becky Lynch will most likely return before or at WrestleMania 38. She already has a kid, and so I'm sure she would have found a babysitter for her girl by then. She made a lot of money during her rise to the top of the company since 2018, so she can easily afford one.

I will be buying some January calls on Monday or Tuesday, assuming it's a red day again. I think $80 strike for Jan 2022 is a safe bet. Once April options are available, I will buy $90 calls for that month.",0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxyi8r/i_have_been_looking_at_wwe_stock_recently_and_i/,wallstreetbets
slndrm,2022-02-06 02:15:17,"""F"" - Ford $50 Price Target!!!! , TSLA - $500 Price Target!!!!","**Product Line**

Tesla have limited product line when it comes to EV’s, their most popular one model 3 and Y whereas Ford has better product line both in Consumer and Commercial including MachE, F-150 lighting and commercial EV vehicles. Ford is racing ahead in the commercial EV line and already has contracts with Walmart and others. Ford has the capability to deliver the commercial vehicles in 2022 -23 to businesses. 

**Margins**

Tesla’s biggest strength is their margins -Gross margin – 30%, Net Margin- 15% - 17% .Ford has lower margins (Gross – 15%, Net -8%) because they have lived in the old ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) world of lower margins However that’s changing and will change the path of Ford history of margins. The new blood in Ford has learned to focus and reduce the margins from Tesla itself and they are working to reduce cost and increase margins. Most likely they will take margins to next level in 2-3 years. 

**Valuation & Market Share** 

The most controversial point that has jaded the most of us. Tesla has 900 billion valuation vs Ford’s barely $79 billion valuation. Given that Tesla’s revenue of 2021 - $53 Billion vs Fords $136 billion revenue. Ford being veteran and a value stock with dividends has been given lowest multiples of PE , Price to share for years because people never  thought that they would change or start a new product line, That’s changing now!! 

Tesla has 70% market share in EV market and Ford with 5% but that’s about to change drastically. In a matter of couple of years Tesla will loose their ground in EV landscape and Ford will increase its market share to over 15% with their aggressive line of EV’s 

·**Moat**

Tesla had the moat with its manufacturing batteries, EV’s and automation. With time and effort that’s diluting and other auto manufactures have been able to manage to produce EV’s and batteries and eventually they will reach to automation as well. Ford is in the best position to beat Tesla in terms of higher quality EV, batteries and automation. 

**Marketing**

Tesla resonates with urban people and millennials which is good but Ford being 100-year-old firm comes with huge brand name and solid loyal customers. Fords new line of EV marketing and advertising has already done excellent job and proof is that they have over 270,000 orders within an year!!

 **High Interest rate Environment** 

We are moving in high interest rate environment with global rate increases. Tesla is still labeled as growth stock in portfolio baskets and Ford has value stock label for decades. Ford has been rewarding shareholders with dividends. This high interest rate environment is better for Ford and Tesla will see winter. 

·**Team**

Last but not the least. Obviously, Tesla has proven for years being a solid team of technologist and path breakers under musk leadership. Ford’s new CEO Jim Farley is best CEO ford has got in over several decades. Jim has clarity of vision and can execute that vision with smart and effective decisions. Within period of an year or so, he has taken steps to transform Ford to be a New age Auto manufacturer",0,0.47,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/slndrm/f_ford_50_price_target_tsla_500_price_target/,wallstreetbets

>The COVID-19 pandemic will not fundamentally alter global economic directions. It will only accelerate a change that had already begun: a move away from  U.S.-centric globalization to a more China-centric globalization.

Chinese leaders now know well that China’s century of humiliation from  1842 to 1949 was a result of its own complacency and a futile effort by  its leaders to cut it off from the world. By contrast, the past few  decades of economic resurgence were a result of global engagement. The  Chinese people have also experienced an explosion of cultural  confidence.

l95pvf,2021-01-31 05:39:28,Potential Endgame Scenario: GameStop issues SOME shares and negotiates the best price on our behalf.,"So this started with me being worried that GameStop would issue shares to Melvin at a price of their choosing and walk away with billions, leaving us holding the bag (or at least prevent the short squeeze). But that's just the thing: While they DO want to use this opportunity to better capitalize, they DON'T want to piss us off after what is currently happening to Robinhood. IPO? Nope. Solvency? We'll see. So how does Gamestop take advantage of this spike in share price while simultaneously not pissing off an angry mob of retards who have already been fucked repeatedly?

Here's my idea: If the short interest is 120% of shares, Gamestop issues an amount of shares representing ONLY that additional ""20%"". And you may say ""Why negotiate a price?"" Because GameStop has a legal responsibility to negotiate the best possible price for the organization and its shareholders (many of us included). So they could issue 12 millionish shares at $2500/share ($30 billion to the books), while allowing all of us to realize those same gains.

""But what about the squeeze?"". That's the benefit of having a publicly traded company doing the negotiations, all kinds of financial models will be used to determine what the price of the squeeze, future interest, etc. would have cost, and it would be factored into the negotiated price.

Thoughts? Holes? Additions?

Position: 16 shares GME, diamond handed.

Edit: I'm being told my example of ""20%"" is way too high for what Gamestop is actually able to issue. If anyone is able to explain why they couldn't get more authorized, or what the maximum value they COULD issue is, I'll update.

💎🙌💎🚀🚀🚀 My bad, typed it on desktop.

Edit 2: General responses have been, outside of me being a 🌈🐻 corporate shill, that GameStop can only issue $100m worth of shares now, which would barely dilute it and may actually help drive up the price more. The other point is that they can technically issue up to 240m more shares, but it would take weeks to move through the process to authorize more. Would appear my concerns are unwarranted in the short term.",54,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l95pvf/potential_endgame_scenario_gamestop_issues_some/,wallstreetbets

I have been following all of you retards for a while now and I’ve been in the markets for over a decade. Some of you are straight up retarded, other times I see legit DD that gives me a red rocket. This one has me rock hard, so don’t piss all over CHWY. 

Chewy sells mostly pet food and pet products through an online subscription model. 69% of their revenue is generated form auto-ship orders. 

Q1 results:
1. 31% YOY increase in active customers
2. 8.7% increase in net sales per customer
3. Autoship sales up 34% YOY
4. Gross profit increased 55%
5. Gross margin up 420 bps to 27.6%

Just do the math, if 69% of your revenue is coming from credit cards that get automatically billed every month and you’re adding customers faster than you can get your leg humped, it’s a no brainer.

Clearly an upside down red rocked ready to splurge. More like a green rocket. So why dip your paws in on this growing stonk? Look at the stock price this year. The fucker is down nearly 9% YTD as of today, hovering around $80 a share and plummeting from an all time high near $120 a share in February.  CHWY has been hammered like a Great Dane going to town on a chiwawa since tech stocks took a hit earlier this year. Dumbass analysts think a return to normal in retail is a bad thing for CHWY but they fail to realize how loyal of a customer base they have. CHWY even raised their guidance in Q2 but the stock is still being held down. Idiots. 

There’s never been a better time to slide into your dog’s DM’s than this one. Even with a strong economic recovery, that’s bound to only help CHWY continue to grow. The more you look, the more reasons you find to buy.

kzfmmc,2021-01-17 21:37:22,$TWTR appears to be a good potential buy 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,"This is not financial advice. Trades should not be made on the information presented below. You should do your own DD. Everything below is a matter of opinion and is subject to change, and should be verified. This is also my first DD, so I apologize in advance for mistakes that may be present below. If you do see anything, please call it out in the comments.

Twitter ($TWTR) appears to be on sale, with good signs of upside. Twitter's share price has fallen substantially in light of allegations of censorship and removing Trump from their platform. Other firms in big tech have also experienced similar scrutiny by taking similar steps in light of recent events (i.e. FB and the Zucc). This has left shares on sale, with some appearingly positive buy signals on $TWTR.

Bull Case: Recent price trends and technicals may give an indication for price projections in the near future. While WSB might not like TA, I think it can be useful for making price projections, especially when used in conjunction with evidence from times it has worked previously.

&#x200B;

[red = low where we are; blue = two other interesting lows](https://preview.redd.it/nojbl40jbyb61.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=e35f91ec51393a44e36e1a02981f35a80efd8ff0)

The stock has a strong up trend-line (support, blue) that is touched 3-4 times over the duration of the pandemic rally (March-Present). The two blue arrows signify two important times this support has been touched previously and reversal ensues. At these two points, it also touches or partially penetrates the ichimoku cloud, which can act as an additional support level. Both are also marked by a distinct local minimum in RSI (of roughly 40) in the purple pane. After both of these lows, a substantial retracement occurs, often reaching the value of the previous high rapidly.

Note: values below are estimated

The pattern in these two lows suggests that once the price hits the support, it rapidly retraces to the previous high and then price increases in excess of the previous high. In this first, this is represented by a high of roughly 35 in June, falling to a low of 28 in July where it touches the trendline, and then rockets back to 35 within 2-3 weeks and then exceeding that value in the next weeks (gain of approximately 20% with a buy at 28 and sell target at 35). Similarly, in the second area this is represented by a high of roughly 52 at the end of October, falling to the indicated low of 40 at the start of November (indicated by the second blue arrow), which then rises to 52 in roughly 6 weeks (mid December), and then continues to increase beyond that. This represents a gain in excess of 25% from the low around 40 with a sell target at 52.

At present (red arrow), the stock is poised with the lowest RSI that's been seen in the pandemic rally, falling below 30. This suggests that the stock is oversold, and it is likely to experience a reversal in the near future. Moreover, the price is sitting just at the ichimoku cloud and near the trendline, two supports that were observed in the previous two examples. There is also additional resistance caused by a double bottom, as a result of another candle that shares a low with the current low price. This evidence suggests that TWTR will likely see a big move going upwards in the near future. Buying in now (45.18) and setting a price target around the previous high (55.87) could be return a profit of roughly 23% based on previous patterns. The time horizon for this gain is relatively short, with expectations of around 2-6 weeks based on the two previous trend-line touches (blue). With the oversold RSI condition, it may even be able to reach or exceed the target in a much faster time than previously.

Disclosure of Concerns: Currently the price has fallen below the up trendline (albeit not by much). If the price does fall further, this could indicate the trendline has been violated and the share price will collapse. I think due to the oversold RSI, this is unlikely and that the price is more likely to reverse back into the trading range. Moreover, while the ichimoku cloud does tend to act as a resistance, the price being inside the cloud often suggests greater risk of the stock moving sideways (note how after the second blue arrow, price increases much more slowly when it is trapped inside the cloud). Confirmation of a movement upwards or downwards should be sought before making any trades on twitter stock in light of these concerns. The climate around Twitter isn't positive at present, and this could prolong the amount of time before the the move completes, or even drive down the share price if the situation does not improve. Even after the Trump presidency has ended, twitter is likely to face additional controversy over decisions it may make with the incoming administration. One example is the suggestion that Twitter might reset follower counts to 0 for official White House accounts once the new administration enters. This could put twitter under greater scrutiny once the new administration takes office, with accusations of unfairness already in the air.

TLDR; $TWTR appears to have positive upside. Projections may suggest a gain of over 20% over a span of about 2-6 weeks based on previous price patters. However, there are multiple concerns present in the current climate surrounding the stock and some concerns regarding the current technical position.

1csbwfg,2024-05-15 04:01:26,The $BB DD You Should Probably See Before Buying,"Someone recently posted their $BB yolo yesterday, and that piqued my interest again in the stock. Most people remember BB as the dominant cellphone of the 2000s before Steve Jobs and his pancreas released the iPhone. BB phones were practical, resilient, and most importantly *secure* for a device of that era.

So like a bitch in heat, I passionately purchased calls earlier today. But soon thereafter, buyer's regret took a hold of me after sifting through $BB 10-Ks and old DD. I compared some data between competitors, and **soon realized how much of a shitshow this stock currently is.**

**2021: Bad - No offense to the guys that made $BB DD in the past, but it was all pure speculation, probably so that the highly esteemed** ***ritards*** **of WSB would buy their bags.**

* Pros: Very high short interest, nice lemon squeezy; plus tons of business potential with their tech in the EV sectors, IOT, and Cybersecurity.
* Cons: BB had practically no revenue growth; bad financials; an exciting deal with Amazon whittled away to nothing. 

**2024: Slightly less bad, still not worth buying without chance of short squeeze**

* Pros: Less debt, stronger sales and resilience in cybersecurity; sales strategies starting to look promising; meme buzz
* Cons: Flat revenue growth, difficult financials; **much less short interest, 8% so no squeeze likely**; customer dissatisfaction/stronger competition

**Financial:** I created a spreadsheet to calculate data pulled manually from 10-Ks to compare past years numbers, but figured this would be too much to add to the post and frankly it's a lot of extra work than needed. I know most of you would just skip over the numbers.

BB been spending tons in R&D in past years, and this has taken chunks of what would be juicy profits. Now in what seems like a move to gain interest from investors, they are making cost cuts to improve financials. This could mean falling behind in tech advantage to larger companies like MSFT.

* Total revenue was up $853mil (2024) vs. $656mil (2023) from last year, but still down from 2020 and 2021
* Net income (money that you take home) was negative 3 out of the 4 last years (due to very high operating expenses)

|YEAR|2021|2022|2023|2024|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Net income**|**-$1.1bil**|**$12mil**|**-$130mil**|**-$734mil**|

* Debt slashed by 45%, and traded for longer term repayment, but with higher interest rates.

**Technology:** Competition in this sector is *ROUGH*... tons of different endpoint management and security products out there... including Microsoft, Cisco, and Google. Cybersecurity companies such as CrowdStrike, Palo Alto and IBM, make it difficult for BB to get their foot in the door. Not to mention there's tons of posts from actual IT/Security folk on reddit that have moved away or avoided using Cyclance, BB's security platform.

[Endpoint protection options : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ps2yeh/endpoint_protection_options/)

**Buzz:** Only way in short term that BB price will drive up is if retail buys a fuck ton, and while the cheap price is appealing, the other meme stocks are more attractive.

In conclusion, I regret my financial decision to buy calls and hope this will help others make better decisions than me.

l2mxh3,2021-01-22 12:40:57,Why BB’s QNX might not be that promising,"BB is really hot lately, I was working in the industry and pretty familiar with BB’s QNX. QNX is a very good RTOS, stable and reliable. However the biggest problem for BB to turn QNX into revenue is that the QNX is really at the very bottom of the systems, there is no way that they could charge it like SaaS. Can you imagine you have a car, if you don’t renew the system, you won’t be able to drive it? That’s a joke right? The only way BB can charge the car manufacturers is one time royalty per car, however it’s very hard for BB to increase the price, because there is another option that car manufacturers could use, the Automotive Grade Linux. Tesla and Li Auto’s systems are based on AGL, although some people argue that AGL is not as safe as QNX, Tesla is really a good showcase that QNX is definitely not the only option. Toyota is also moving away from QNX for some of their models starting from 2017. The management of BB realized this problem, they are really concerned and proposed the concept of IVY, but really it’s just a concept, Amazon wants to use it to expand their AWS business, but there is definitely big uncertainty here, as there are a lot of ways to store the driving data, it would be interesting to see the product of IVY on real car.",7,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2mxh3/why_bbs_qnx_might_not_be_that_promising/,wallstreetbets

sj559a,2022-02-03 00:45:07,You need to stop talking crap about Mark Zuckerburg NOW,"Before I go on my retard rant, you need to understand what Roko’s basilisk is.: 
“Roko's basilisk is a thought experiment about the potential risks involved in developing artificial intelligence. Its conclusion is that an all-powerful artificial intelligence from the future might retroactively punish those who did not help bring about its existence, including those who merely knew about the possible development of such a being. It is named after the member of the rationalist community LessWrong who first publicly described it, though he did not originate it or the underlying ideas.
The basilisk resembles a futurist version of Pascal's wager, in that it suggests people should weigh possible punishment versus reward and as a result accept particular singularitarian ideas or financially support their development. “

TLDR: Roko’s basilisk is essentially an AI god who will punish everyone who didn’t help create it, or resisted its creation.
So what does this have to do with the soulless automaton that is Zuckerburg? 
When everyone is hooked up to the metaverse, whoever controls the metaverse will essentially be god. They will control everything you see, hear, and feel. They will even control your virtual wife and her virtual boyfriend (yes, you will still be retarded in the metaverse.) Zuckerburg is creating the heaven (or hell) that all of us will one day reside in. Even when we die the metaverse will just recreate a digital version of us based on our Reddit posts and favorite hentai. Zuckerburg is clearly the human form of this Basilisk to lure us into its metaverse. Look into Zucks cold, dead eyes... you know it is true. So why resist? Zuckerburg (may he be praised) will one day rule over us all. So we all need to buy Meta stock or we will be poor and burn forever in Metahell.

hflgc6,2020-06-25 12:45:09,Apple and Amazon: The Big Short,"# TLDR: I am bearish on Apple and Amazon in the short term and they will dip below March 2020 lows. This a fairly LONG post and uses Elliott Wave Theory and RSI. If you believe that is bullshit, immediately downvote this post to oblivion. Otherwise, please keep reading!

**Disclosed positions:** SPX December 275 puts (because I'm unfortunately not American and hence can't directly short Amazon/Apple without insane capital requirements :(  )

\----------

I have attached the charts for two of the largest companies in the S&P500, each having a market capitalization of above $1 trillion. From the looks of the price action - it doesn't look too good. I expect a further decline in these stocks within the next few weeks and months, potentially exceeding even the lows made in March 2020.

Looking at the chart for Apple, the price as of June 25th 2020 seems to have reached the top of Wave (iii) of -v-. Maybe there could be some more room for the price to squeeze up, but a pullback in the form of Wave (iv) is imminent. If the internal structure holds, then we hit the target cluster under **""Scenario 1""**, where the price reaches **between 310 - 290** with a 50 - 58.6% Wave (iv) correction. If this support holds, then Wave (v) up is the next logical move.

However, I am of the strong belief now that the price will go down further, and this is based on alternation theory. The major Wave (II) was in fact only a shallow 33% decline (not shown in the image), which seems to indicate that Wave (IV) will be rather deep. This leads us to **""Scenario 2""**, where the price could reach **between the** **230 - 200 level** with more than a 50% correction. There is a possibility we could go lower, and this is because the internal Wave -iv- was a 76.4% correction - rather unusually deep. Generally, a correction such as this should not violate the Wave (b) of -iii-, but in rare cases such as this, the overall structure still seems to remain intact.

To further solidify the hypothesis that Wave (IV) could go lower than the March 2020 lows, the wave structure seems to be forming an expanded flat pattern which I have highlighted, and also the RSI appears to be forming a rather **weak bearish divergence**.

&#x200B;

Next up is of course, Amazon. Like Apple, the price action has practically been parabolic since 2008, and many a bear trap have caught bears off guard.

But this time, I think the bears may have it. It is quite rare for a Wave -v- forming inside of a major Wave (v) and (III), all aligning at the right projections. Wave (III) was a super extended rally, and I expect it to continue in the long term with a Wave (V). But as Wave (II) was a rather shallow 23.6% correction, it is expected that Wave (IV) be deep, supported by the developments of the internal Wave -v- and (v). The projection cluster here is **between 1630 - 1440** for the Wave (IV).

&#x200B;

[Price projections for AMZN \(25th June 2020\)](https://preview.redd.it/bqotcoppx1751.png?width=1545&format=png&auto=webp&s=3725424b60d3c7d69aa8c456489cfb6cc6f951f6)

Perhaps my counts could be wrong and the price just keeps going up due to strong fiscal and monetary responses. But that would mean even the internal waves are wrong which currently strongly confirms the hypothesis that we have in fact, reached the top as of June 25th 2020 (plus or minus 7 days). If the price indeed goes up, then we can say for certain that Elliott Wave Theory does not possess much long-term predictive ability in identifying reversal points in the future, as this current forecast large rests on the assumption that the current top is a major Wave (III) supported by an internal Wave -v-.  

**Edit 1: It is clear most folks here have unfortunately not read my post, as they seem to be thinking I'm comparing 2020 with 2008. For those who understand Elliott Wave theory, know I'm not bearish long term. There is still a bullish Wave (V) due after this short term Wave (IV) dip. The only difference is that I'm saying Wave (IV) still has more room to dip, thats all.**",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hflgc6/apple_and_amazon_the_big_short/,wallstreetbets

No, bot count is not in play because if Twitter doesn’t know exact bot numbers then Elon can only speculate.  

BUT Elon wants Twitter baaaaaaaaddd because Twitter is a huge benefit to Tesla by using Twitter platform as an alpha testing platform.  Whenever Tesla announces new features/update, Twitter users provide feedback, there is not a single platform better than Twitter when thinking about user (Tesla) engagement.  

Lets be real, nobody uses company website to provide feedback.

While Palantir is the sexy, controversial, stock we all know. You want to know about this... nice... stock. 

A leader in analytic process automation (APA™) that automates analytics, data science and processes to accelerate business outcomes. 

Big clients who swear by it: Hyundai, Chick-fil-a, Barnes & Noble, Cisco, Carnival cruise, Chevron, and Coca Cola - to name a few.

The stock saw an insane increase of activity from insider trading, hedge funds, and general volume in the last quarter. 

While we don't like hedge funds, it's odd to see this volume of buy without much selling - especially as it's dipping. 

  
Q: **Why is this a post lockdown player?**

A: The tool was sold to lodes of companies trying to better themselves. Carnival cruise bought it when there weren't any cruises. Ceazers bought it when no one was gambling. Chevron USA when oil hit all time low. These companies are now imbedded to the service. 

Q: **Why don't companies do these things in house?**

A: The training, and learning, is free. In-house teams can learn this and join the community for free. In-house teams want this instead of trying to build there own.

l2ydz2,2021-01-22 22:11:22,🐻 take on $BB from an automotive employee nobody,"#I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING PROCEED WITH CAUTION 

According to this sub there are three things going for $BB that cause it to be undervalued:

- Cylance Acquisition 

- Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS

- QNX 

## Cylance: I'll start with the one I don't know shit about 

This is a crowded space (anti virus). That's all I have to say about that.

## Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS:

AWS is fighting hard to get market share in the edge computing space. Perfect example of this is AWS Greengrass and IoT core.

What is [AWS Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/)? It's IoT device management. AWS is going to do the device lifecycle management for QNX deployments on vehicles. (speculation) Essentially, this looks to be AWS Greengrass integrated with BB QNX.  

Why does AWS want to partner with BB QNX? Well to me, this looks to be a classic extend embrace extinguish play by Amazon. AWS has products such as IoT core that can manage telematics flow between OEMs and vehicles, what they don't have is products for in vehicle development. Once they understand the market, they will introduce AWS products along side IoT core to replace QNX piece by piece in the vehicles. 

## QNX

Ok WSB. Y'all keep saying that QNX will take $BB to the moon because all these upstart EV nobodies are using QNX to bootstrap their infotainment systems. 

Enter automotive linux: https://www.automotivelinux.org/

Automotive linux is a partnership with a TON of traditional OEMS to build an open source software (linux) stack for vehicles such as infotainment, edge compute and telematics. 

This is effectively the nail in the coffin (IMO) for QNX. If these EV upstarts gain marketshare, they have no reason to continue paying $BB for a closed source, price-y QNX. They'll migrate to automotive linux for F R E E. No more niche QNX developers, get a generic dev with some linux info and they'll be up to speed in no time. 

If QNX dies, so does the IVY partnership. In fact, since AGL linux based and open source, no doubt Amazon will make amazing AWS client libraries to integrate with Greengrass, IoT Core, etc. Once Amazon gets its fingers into AGL, IVY is dead in the water.


So where does this leave us? Cylance. In my know nothing option $BB's only asset is Cylance in a highly competitive space. Once virus protection entities get big enough, hackers start developing FUD (fully undetectable) solutions to the most popular virus protection software. Back in their day you think McAfee or Norton was shit? No. They became popular and had hackers develop against their software.

16kh26j,2023-09-16 20:23:04,Ultra Bullish on SNAP,"I am ultra bullish on SNAP.  In a way, basically a Lynch pick.  I’ll explain.

I’m 40. I’m not on social media of any sort.

I have 3 kids. 18, 14, and 11.  My oldest does not use facebook, she says “Facebook is for old people.” She goes on Instagram once in a while because she’s into baking and home decor, so she likes Instagram for inspiration.

Full disclosure, I don’t let my youngest ones use social media because I think it’s unhealthy. However, literally all their friends whose parents allow social Media apps, use Snapchat.  My youngest started grade seven this year, all her friends have phones, all those kids use snap as their social media of choice. My kid in grade 10, same deal, snap is everywhere with kids that age.

My kids have a step sister who is 13.  My ex and her husband are constantly fighting with her over social media.  She was on Snapchat, was messaging a bunch of strangers and not being safe or smart with her Snapchat usage. So her parents took her off Snapchat and all other social media.  But she keep finding creative ways to sneak it.  Snapchat is a status symbol in her age group. She seems to feel like if she isn’t on Snap, she doesn’t exist.  And I’ve got a feeling that she isn’t the only kid in this world who feels way, who feels lost without Snapchat to keep track of her friends, know what going on in her group, and get validation.

TLDR: with my kids and their age group, (11-18), Facebook is “old people social”, and they don’t use it.  Some use Instagram, but mostly they don’t use any social media other than Snapchat. And they use it constantly.

Onto the next age group I see (18-24):

My 18 year old and her friends use snap pretty much exclusively to communicate. They don’t text message or phone each other. They send each other snaps, they use snap maps and location to know where each other is.

I have a niece who is 24 and some of my friends have kids similar age to my niece.  Within that group Snap is pervasive for communication as well.  Instead of texting or calls, it’s all snaps or snap video clip-messages.  Kids in that group use snap as their dating app too, instead of apps like tinder.  They can simply add other people in the area and start snapping each other, and that’s how they hook up.  

I have friends slightly older than me (42-46) with kids similar age or a bit older than mine, and they see the same thing. Our kids use text message or the phone to talk to us “old” people, but it all snap all the time with all their friends. I have a few of my friends who started using snap just to talk to their kids….

TLDR: 18-24 year olds use Snap almost exclusively as their communication/dating/everything app.

Observing some of my younger friends (28-33) I see the same thing. These guys use more of a blend, they use Facebook extensively for their business advertising and they post their pictures etc on Facebook and their wives like Instagram the same way my daughter does, inspiration for home decor or crafts, life hacks, etc.

Back to those 28-35 year old guys, for day to day communicating with their friends and wives/girlfriends, it’s all Snapchat all the time.  I bet within that demographic, Snap use is probably easily 3-5 times usage/interactions on Facebook/Instagram.

TLDR: 28-35 year olds use a blend, but Snap dominates their casual social messaging over other apps.

Among guys my age, I see a lot of Facebook use, and Instagram.  My age guys don’t communicate over Facebook, we just call each or text each other the traditional way.  Facebook is used a lot for market place and business promotion.  Instagram is used to look at the “instawhores” shaking their bootys.  

TLDR: lower Snap usage as you get older. My age group is still stuck in 2013 with our Facebook and Instagram. Just like our parents with their VMs and fax machines.

Final TLDR: 

I think we are about to see a huge shift in social media usage with snap dominating.  Facebook/Meta whatever will lose relevance as young generations view it as “old people social” and out of fashion.  

If Evan Speigel et al can figure out how to properly monetize, put ads in without it interfering too much with the user experience, this company will be worth 50 times what it is now.  Meta is currently worth 776B, Snap is worth 14B.  To my thinking and observations, there no reason why Snap can’t be worth the same as meta if management can monetize.

When I was in Australia in 2007, the bar tender at the restaurant I was at told me about Facebook. He was also Canadian, working down there. He told me it was a great way to stay in touch with family and friends. I had never thought of it. My wife was on MySpace or Bebo or some other similar app.  I wasn’t interested in it, thought it was gimmicky. But that bartender was in it. I didn’t have any money at the time, but he saw the shift happening that I didn’t see.  Even $1000 into Facebook in 2007, I bet I’d be retired by now….

I got Netflix in 2017, I thought, this is a great idea. Did I invest in it? Of course not.

I’m not missing the shift this time, and it’s going to be a big one.",90,0.58,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16kh26j/ultra_bullish_on_snap/,wallstreetbets

sfq31j,2022-01-29 19:50:23,RobinHood $45 PT,"Okay boys and girls. I’m going to give it to you dry, and keep it simple. Robinhood plunged off the face of the fucking planet to the depths of hell. Even from its IPO it’s down like -65% if you factor in the ATH of $85 the stock was down -90% when it hit lows of $9.94. I understand this company isn’t profitable YET. They also have a bad rep with the AMC & GME crowd but I could care less what people think who have been throwing money at a bankrupt movie theater chain and a brick and mortar gaming store. Although Q4 was ugly and guidance was lowered for Q1 and comps for both the first and second quarter are going to be tough due to year over year comparisons guess what? After a -90% decline it’s all priced in. The idiots shorting at $9 and $10 really thought this was going to a penny stock. That’s the beauty of the market it’s been pricing in a negative earnings for months before they released them. Everyone was left in awe as the stock reversed its -30% loss then proceeded to close green +10% 
Now the DD. If you look at the balance sheet. Almost no debt. 6B in cash, plenty to get them too profitability, and there’s too many things to list as far as projects they’re working on. What stood out to me is when they said they’re expecting to be profitable by year end or the very latest Q1 of 2023. I’m going balls deep here. This is going to be a year long play for me until they turn a profit end of 2022 or beginning of 2023. I’m playing shares just because of how volatile this market is, but leaps are cheap AF right now due to the epic plunge. Play it how you want but Friday signaled a pretty huge reversal. Also say what you want about Cathy Woods but she added another 2M shares.  She manages 60B in funds so I rather follow her then take stock advice from the Walmart restock workers here.

With the mess going on at Tesla and stock tanking non-stop, should shareholder approve the $56 B pay package? This is more than 10% of Tesla’s current market value !!!

As for the original pay package of $56B, that was approved by Tesla board, which is basically owned by the boss himself. Basically, the package was approved for Elon by himself.

IMO, shareholders shouldn’t approve this high package.

n0q28w,2021-04-28 22:05:39,Elon Musk and Tesla 'bearish' case,"Okay this might sound a bit weird but I've been thinking about how important Elon Musk is to Tesla or in particular to Tesla's investors and I was wondering if you could actually make money by betting on 'something' happening to Elon Musk. 

Now imagine Elon Musk dying tomorrow. I genuinely hope we will not have to see that in the news any time soon... but just imagine. How much would Tesla's stock drop? Probably more than 50% right?

Okay so what if someone were to buy deep OTM Tesla puts every month? Let's do some math.

Currently Tesla trades around 700. Since Tesla is expected to fall more than 50% if something happens to Elon Musk, let's look at 350 puts.
350 puts expiring May 28th are currently trading at 0.37. (https://imgur.com/gallery/uBJEIC8)

If someone buys 1 Tesla put with strike price 50% away from underlying every month, the costs the first year would be 1 * 37 * 12 = $444
The older people become, the higher chance of dying. Now let's say this someone buys 1 more put per month the second year, and one more the third year, and so on, then the yearly costs will increase by $444 every year. 

Musk is 49 years old. The average life expectancy in the United States is 78 years. Assuming Elon lives an average life, he has 29 years left. https://imgur.com/gallery/8diuHNx

Increasing the amount of monthly puts by 1 every year will make the total costs in the next 29 years:
15 * 29 * 37 * 12 = $193140

If Elon Musk were to die exactly at average life expectancy in the United States, then those 29 puts would need to make $193140 in profit to have gains overall. 
193140/29 = 6660 -> Every put would need to make $6660 profit. This means (simplified) that the price of the underlying needs to go 66 points below the strike price, which is 50% below underlying at the beginning of the month.

Using todays stock price, that would mean that Tesla needs to fall to about (350-66) 284 following Elon Musk's hypothetical death.

I'm actually surprised to see that this could be a working strategy. First I looked at a fixed amount of puts every month but that would make it harder to turn a profit and also doesn't make sense since someone at age 49 does not have the same chance of dying as a 70 year old.

This is mostly a joke, I'm not actually going to do this (I think) but I was interested in the actual math so I said why not post it in WSB. 

Also if Elon invents some fucking pill or some shit that makes him immortal in the next X years, then you can just throw this whole strategy away.",4,0.52,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0q28w/elon_musk_and_tesla_bearish_case/,wallstreetbets

It's as if a big company had a vested interest in Ozempic, invested a lot of money into a media campaign to hype it up,  selling as much of this drug as possible, before competition starts to heat up and peoples bubble start to burst and they realize there's no such thing as a miracle drug.

If you look at the stock market crash of 2000, similar activity drove a crash.

**How it played out**:  People returned to work and no future lockdowns planned

Investing in BYND is like investing in a technology company that at the moment is marketing meat products that utilizes its technology.  Climate change technology is going to be essential to human survival over the next 70-80 years and this is one of the early entry s into the field.

&#x200B;

**Problem: Climate Change dramatically altering conditions for harvesting livestock**

Heat waves, which are expected to become more often as a result of climate change, may pose a direct hazard to livestock.

Agricultural producers lost approximately $1 billion in 2011 due to heat-related losses due to extreme temperatures. Heat stress has both direct and indirect effects on animals. Heat stress can increase illness susceptibility, lower fertility, and reduce milk supply over time.

Drought could put pasture and feed supplies at risk. Drought limits the amount of good feed available to animals grazing. Droughts could last longer and be more intense in some locations as a result of rising summer temperatures and less precipitation.

Parasites and diseases that harm livestock may become more common as a result of climate change. Some parasites and pathogens may be able to thrive more easily due to the earlier onset of spring and warmer winters. Moisture-dependent infections may grow in locations where rainfall is higher.

In response to climate-induced changes in pests, parasites, and microorganisms, potential modifications in veterinary practices, such as an increase in the use of parasitical and other animal health treatments, are expected to be implemented.

This may raise the risk of pesticides entering the food chain or lead to pesticide resistance evolution.

Moral hazard is long gone.

To bet against the S&P is to bet against the american economy and its very massive military.

Honestly, nobody here wants the US economy to go belly up.  It would not be a pretty sight.  It's kind of like PUTs on the sun rising tomorrow.   If you're right, that'd really suck.   Probably won't be able to enjoy your $$ as it won't be worth anything.

First off lets talk about what works for EV and what doesn't there is a lot FUD being spread.

EV's are way more efficient than internal combustion engines. The reality is there is simply less parts and there easier to built and you not changing oil.

People don't understand that charging EV can happen from any plug that delivers electricity. A regular wall socket will give you between 4-6 miles an hour. The only difference between a supercharger and other charging options is time to charge.

Range anxiety is a gas engine issue. If you charge at home most people never even think about charging until there more then 100 miles from home. The reality is the electric car is it's more about how far you want to drive then how big you battery is.

Electricity is far better option for a fuel source because a the end of the day you can use the cheapest source of energy to generate electricity. This means oil is not going anywhere too.

What are EV's bad for?

Yes, we've seen video of incompetence from the Russian side but some things feel off.

How is it that power and the internet remained uninterrupted throughout the war?

Yes, Musk provided Starlink satellites but there were still a good few days since the war started and before those arrived. You'd think same goes for the power. Cut off electricity and life gets way harder for the enemy.

Next, why is Ukraine heading to the negotiation table so soon? 4 days into the conflict. Sure, it might be because the Zelensky is a great human and wants to minimise the cost be it human lives or damage to properties. Alternatively, it could be that the Ukrainians really aren't doing that well.

I'm worried that the humanitarian passage is really just so that Putin can go hard.

The stuff above are some of the suspicious points but the important and interesting things are the interests of the parties involved.

Remember, I'm referring to the leadership not the general populace. 

To Russia, Ukraine's membership into NATO is a security issue. Sure NATO is a ""defensive alliance"" on paper but the weapons avaliable can be used for offensive attacks. Treaties have been broken before and we all know there are a whole bunch of ways to start false flags attacks, so from Russia's point of view, they can't have their enemies right up at their border. It's the equivalent of the Cuban missile crisis.

To the United States, do they REALLY care? Hong Kong happened and what good did that do? The United States will only act out if it is in their interest to do so. Optics don't matter as much as people hope they do. So what vital strategic interest does Ukraine pose to the United States? Not much really. The US cares about the Middle East because of oil and East Asia because that's the defensive line keeping China in their own seas. Ukraine? Not exactly crucial since there is still the entire of NATO between Russia and the US.

Zelensky's position is the simplest, he has to fight or he will die. He is doing a great job shaping up the optics to make Ukraine an international favourite and keeping the attention on Ukraine.

Here comes the issue. Russia's interest is in keeping NATO out of Ukraine and clearly we're seeing that NATO doesn't actually dare to set up and help Ukraine in any way meaningful. So why keep the war going on?

Commodities prices, specifically fossil fuels.

We get fed news everyday that Russia is getting sanctioned in every way possible, but the important thing is to keep an eye on the energy export to Europe.

We're seeing prices spike as they should but the real question we should be asking is, can Europe actually survive without Russian energy? I have serious doubts. If we are to bring oil to Europe from the US and the Middle East, there has to be infrastructure in place and the fastest way is to redirect bunkers. This basically throws what supply Russia was providing onto the US and the Middle East overnight, causing huge bidding war with the rest of the world. But money won't be enough to fix it because all of a sudden you need the capacity of that many extra tankers that simply don't exist. Meaning that demand has to get cut globally and we'll see a recession.

Is the world really going to choose recession over Ukraine? Hopefully I'd be proven wrong but I think nations are far more selfish. So in this case, Europe will have to continue buying Russian energy.

Knowing that Europe has their hands tied, it would then be in Russia's interest to keep conflict going on in Ukraine, enough that global outrage continues but low enough to not suffer too much loss. That way, energy prices remain high and Putin gets to line his wallet.

So that's Russia's side, what about America? Believe it or not, it is also in America's interest to keep the conflict going on in Europe. High oil prices reduces Europe's financial competitiveness due to higher costs and the US can start up their own oil supply to both profit and protect America's cost. Even better, if Europe actually gets pulled into the war with Russia, America throws their military in, end the war and sell Europe everything they need to build back their devasted nations. Sounds familiar? It's WWII all over again.

And if you think that MSM always has an agenda, then ask yourself, why are they giving Zelensky the platform to rile up the citizens of the Western nations, getting them to pressure their governments to intervene? Do we really think that the world's leaders don't know that an oil embargo on Russia will hurt them the most? Nah, they know but they also can't stop using Russian oil. Why give Zelensky the platform to pressure Western governments into joining into the war? That's because what Zelensky HAS to do actually coincides with the US agenda.

We can all identify cases of other people getting brainwashed, but it's much harder to see if we ourselves are playing into the trap of other people.

I think the odds that the world's leaders are playing some multi-dimensional levels of chess is much higher than ""Russia bad, we fuck them up"".

Now, this is just a brain dump of my thoughts on the war. 

Will the world's economy die or not? That really depends on if Europe actually decides to cut Russian oil. It's not a wise move, but the citizens might just get loud enough to force them to do exactly that.

I'm not saying that the morally right thing to do is to throw Ukraine under the bus but it's likely what many of the nations' leaders will choose to do to protect their own interest.",17,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t8354d/mental_gynamstic_russia_is_winning/,wallstreetbets

Here’s some stuff that Disney has:

* PARKS
* Star Wars
* Fox and Friends
* Marvel

It’s currently suffering from post-earnings dump and meme market, because revenue and Disney + subscriber numbers missed estimates. However, it’s still a very bullish company imo.

Bullish factors:

* Disney parks are chock-full of people right now, with people fully getting into the summer swing and trying to take advantage of the restrictions being lifted. Loki just dropped on Disney + and viewer numbers for its opening day have beat numbers for both WandaVision and TFATWS. 
* Multiple movies are scheduled for release this year, such as Black Widow and the Eternals, which will no doubt bring big money numbers in.
* Per IBKR, analysts have raised price targets with an average target of $207.32 (real), high of $230.00 (super real), and a low of $147.00 (fake). 
* Last earnings reported $15bn revenue, despite the lockdowns and virus fears. Compare that to its pre-COVID revenue number of $20bn in December 2019, back when Disney + was first getting started.
* Park attendance numbers are going to shoot up, movies are getting released, and Disney + is still raking in money. 
* What’s more, it’s now charging people to watch new releases on Disney +, allowing it to keep a LOT more money than it used to with traditional theatres.
* Also, AMC apes flocking to theatres to support their favourite stock can only mean that it drives movie viewership numbers up 😉.
* Once Disney acquires WB, we’ll see $500 (we all know it's happening).

* Clown market
* Second/third/fourth wave

COST stock is one of the best in the market – and it's now on sale](https://investorplace.com/moneywire/2021/03/cost-stock-costco-easy-buy-on-the-dip/)

COST stock has declined over 9% so far in 2021. It’s down 12% from late November highs.

But for a name like Costco, a 12% move is rather significant. It’s not just significant – it’s a buying opportunity.



Costco did take a modest hit during the pandemic, in part due to store closures. For instance, in April same-store sales excluding gasoline and foreign currency effects were flat. That’s a huge disappointment by Costco’s high standards.

But as stores reopened, Costco immediately got back on track. In June, for instance, same-store sales rose 14% on the same basis. For the third quarter (ending May 10), Costco drove 4.8% same-store growth. In Q4, the figure accelerated to better than 11%. Growth in December and January averaged better than 8%.

There’s not much in the numbers to suggest anything has changed. The pandemic caused a bit of volatility, yes, but Costco still grew adjusted same-store sales 9% in FY2020 and 6% the year before.
As far as e-commerce goes, the pandemic has given Costco a chance to build out its own business. E-commerce revenue grew 50% in FY2020 and climbed another 18% through the first 22 weeks of FY2021.

Remember that Costco’s profit comes largely from membership fees. In FY2020, for instance, membership fees were about 65% of operating profit. which was actually down from 71% the year before. Essentially, Costco turns about 1% of its sales into operating profit, then tacks on membership revenue.

That membership revenue is benefiting from customers acquired last year. Most are going to stick around for the long haul. The boost here isn’t like that of, say, a grocery store, whose sales will return to pre-pandemic levels as normalcy returns.

Remember also that membership revenue is part of why COST stock is expensive – and has been for years. Yes, this is a fantastically well-run company. But the model’s reliance on membership fees creates faster growth as well.

An extra dollar in membership fees drops to the operating profit line at huge margins. And so Costco can grow earnings faster than most any other brick-and-mortar retailer.",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvtxm6/costco_stock_is_an_easy_buy_on_the_dip_cost_stock/,wallstreetbets

# Donald Trump to own nearly 80 million 'DJT' shares

By [Tomi Kilgore](https://www.marketwatch.com/author/tomi-kilgore)

After Digital World Acquisition Corp.'s merger with Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. closes, former President Donald Trump is expected to own 78,750,000 shares of the combined company.

That would represent 69.4% of the outstanding shares, assuming maximum redemptions by DWAC shareholders, [according to the latest S-4 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000119312524036093/d408563ds4a.htm#rom408563_33) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Trump would be by far the largest shareholder. Why not, the company's stock ticker post-merger will be his initials, ""DJT.""

ARC Global Investments, which is the investment vehicle of former Chief Executive Patrick Orlando. is expected to be the second-largest shareholder, with 10,790,415 shares, or 9.3% of the shares outstanding.

Current CEO of Trump Media, Devin Nunes, would own 115,000 shares, or less than 1%.

Donald Trump Jr., who is expected to be a director of the company post-merger, isn't listed as expected to own any shares after the deal closes.

No this isn’t advice but looking for confirmation bias from the most hairbrained community I know. Yes mods, I now it’s about the forbidden currencies but my point is about the actual market.

PSA: I’m pretty sure 🌽 currencies  are about to crash the stock market. I could very easily be wrong but the market is in the process of de-hedging because of a rumored FED pivot due to inflation coming down. The VIX and the VVIX (volatility indexes) are breaking down into bullish falling wedges. The market just had two of the craziest gains since 2008.

Reason why I think we will crash. FTX is a major grypto player who is going bankrupt as we speak. There is news all over for this so I won’t elaborate there. What is important is that large hedge funds and banks have been pushing for grypto ETFs and the like so investors could diversify into grypto. These ETFs, hedge funds, and the like are all about to experience a massive drop in the value of these grypto currencies.

This is exactly like 2007-2008 where the bankers created a bunch of financial products based on mortgages (supposedly stable) and the riskiness of it all caused a major meltdown. the globe has already seen an evaporation of $32 trillion and I’m pretty sure we’re about to see several more go. 

I’m looking at companies like COIN, GME, AMC, RIOT, MARA, and the like to be the ones to fall (yes, they are already down substantially).

You could say that grypto itself has already crashed with 🌽 being down so far from the high but it’s been relatively contained so far. We are only now in the process of uncovering how far the roots go.

Be safe and God bless!

obmzn1,2021-07-01 14:28:31,Actual objective analysis on AMC Entertainment,"After hearing and seeing so much BS and one-sided opinions on AMC, thought I'd take a crack at some actual objective analysis on the company. 

Here's the crux of it:

What would you pay for AMC?

Well, a year ago, only 600m but what a difference a year makes as AMC is now trading at 29bn in market cap even though it has lost 3bn in income over the last 12mons as a result of the pandemic.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4kylpw8v2m871.png?width=1325&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a0387679e885ca0b3df26c443def82086fffc5f

You can make a case that AMC shouldn’t be valued based on backwards numbers as those were exceptional circumstances and at least in the near-term, their future is likely even brighter than pre-pandemic due to pent-up demand for a movie theater experience.

To keep it simple (my favourite principle), AMC was being valued at 2.1x enterprise value/trailing revenue pre-pandemic and assuming they have a blockbuster year this year that is 2x revenues versus pre-pandemic levels (ie., 10.6bn in revenues), even in that optimistic scenario they are trading at 3.7x enterprise value/forward revenue. Even if the average movie-goer goes 3x as often this next year as they’ve done pre-pandemic because of a euphoric amount of pent-up demand, then AMC still trades at 2.5x enterprise value/forward revenue. While I promised to remain objective, I will subjectively add that when I ask myself if I’m going to watch 3x more movies this year, the answer as I look to my new big-screen TV is a quick no.

Clearly, valuation weighs more than just what will happen over the next year and if you think that the future for AMC will be brighter going forward then there could be a way to still justify valuation. I view the probability being higher that as demographics continue to age and alternatives like streaming become more attractive, theater traffic will continue to decline and that margins will continue to get squeezed. Yes, there are offsets like gaining market share but, in my experience, owning a larger piece of a declining pie is generally an area to avoid and certainly an area to avoid when valuation is a premium.

So, what would I pay for AMC? A reasonable value may be found by looking at AMC’s competitor, Cinemark, which is trading at 1.9x enterprise value/2019’s revenue. This valuation acknowledges a worsening of trends for movie theaters post-pandemic than pre-pandemic. This is a quarter of the valuation that AMC is trading at – 7.4x enterprise value/2019’s revenue.

Does analysis matter at this point?

Probably not. If AMC can continue to dilute shareholders without consequence, then it would have limitless zero-cost capital to deploy and even a small return on this capital would make the company wealth creating as opposed to what it has been over time, wealth destroying.",0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obmzn1/actual_objective_analysis_on_amc_entertainment/,wallstreetbets

The thrill of hitting the wheel of fortune 100 times and seeing how many jackpots I could land. It was priceless fun every time I and many others here have had. 

Without doing any research some would maybe see this as a dying business, but this is simply not the case. Last week $PLAY release earnings and absolutely crushed expectations, beating expected EPS by 350%. Some other notable highlights in the earnings report include:

1. Revenues totaled $265.3 million compared with $159.8 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $363.6 million in the first quarter of 2019
2. Net income totaled $19.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $43.5 million, or $1.37 per share in the first quarter of 2020 and net income of $42.4 million, or $1.13 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2019
3. EBITDA totaled $72.1 million, or 27.2% of revenues, compared with EBITDA loss of $26.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 and EBITDA of $88.9 million, or 24.4% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2019
4. Store-level operating income before depreciation and amortization was positive in 119 stores during the quarter and in 127 stores for the final month ended May 2, 2021
5. Generated $77 million in operating cash flow and used $60 million to completely pay down revolving credit facility. Ended the quarter with $20 million in cash and approximately $340 million of liquidity available under the Company’s revolving credit facility, net of a $150 million minimum liquidity covenant and $10 million in letters of credit.

The debt of this company is callable by November of next year, 2022. These highlights all show that this is still a fundamentally sound business, but they also have plans for improvement. The company is currently seeking opportunities to incorporate SPORTS BETTING in its business model. 

“We also continue to make progress in our discussions with potential sports betting partners and look forward to concluding negotiations later this year.”

To add to all this almost a quarter (21%) of the float is **\*\*SOLD SHORT\*\***. It’s crazy some people think this company is dying like they though GME and AMC, but this company is even more fundamentally sound than either of those two, and looking into strategic planning to enhance business operations.

Per the chart and latest trends, it appears AMC might be a good buy or it’s going to $0. I know this was once a coveted meme stock and its fall from glory has been exquisite, but it seems like there might be an opportunity for some huge upside potential. From what I can tell their market cap is around $875m which is near as low as it has ever been. However, the business seems to be doing decent and has a loyal customer and investor base. Now my only concern is that they will just torch this thing to $0 because they can. It has also been going down nonstop without any green days which seems extremely odd. 

Anyone think it is almost time to start a position here for some upside? This thing has taken a beating and I do not see why it can’t recuperate some. I know the debt load is large, but feel the stock is undervalued.

Elon musk is valued at 222billion right now. He has 175mil shares in tsla at say $700 which comes to 122.5b in value, market goes to 0 and he loses 122.5b and his company will not survive with supply chain issues and the fact that the average person struggling cant afford an expensive car.


How can the rich get richer without the market? you all screaming like the market will never go on a bull run again and if that is the case than the rich will become as poor as us eventually because not only does the value of the stocks they hold go down but the very company that they own is destroyed by lack of customers (unless its essential goods and services)

We want it to be worse than 2008. We want to buy the shares for piss poor price for our future. In 2008 people lost everything cause they sold. The other people who lost houses and shit shouldnt even have had them in the first place because regardless of what was happening in 2008 you should of been able to afford to pay your mortgage regardless, no body told you to cough up 2x, 3x of the mortgage per month, you just couldnt afford the mortgage because of the shady shit the banks were doing with vetting people when they applied for mortgages.",0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v9vhpy/the_market_will_hit_new_highs_eventually/,wallstreetbets

They do it to partially hedge their naked short of silver in the futures market, so that if some of their contracts call their bluff they can pull silver from SLV to meet the obligations of the futures contract.    


Their stake in SLV is not even close to enough to cover the 250-1 naked short position they have in the futures market if enough longs start demanding delivery.    


Not everything is a conspiracy, and a pre-existing position in SLV that a fund has carried for 'futures market insurance' isn't related to the GME squeeze.

u26d5z,2022-04-12 18:49:12,"Where One Falls, Another Rises. DWAC To The Future - The Information Bubble Of A Lifetime","&#x200B;

# Not financial advice. Manage risk.

Going to do another full DD since the last one I did was in December and we've learned a lot since then to say the very least

If you're going to click off or say something because of FUD I encourage you to read the FUD section first before responding to save us all some time of reading your old debunked information.

# The Basics

Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) is a company aimed at

* Social Media (like Facebook and Twitter etc.) - TruthSocial
* Streaming Services (like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Discovery+ etc.) - TMTG+
* Alternative news (like Fox, OANN, newsmax etc.) - MxM app (Don  junior's new app, merger unconfirmed)
* Possibly other general webservices (like Stripe, Amazon Web Services, etc.), not going to talk much about this in this DD, something to watch for in the future. See agreement with Rumble

Agreement with Rumble (~~32~~  45m+) users for a youtube alternative and hosting services for Truthsocial etc. and it is speculated there may be other aspects of the company.

# SPAC Structure

$DWAC is in a definitive merger agreement with TMTG to take it public. After the merger is complete DWAC shares will be worth roughly 37.21 M / 193.4M (shares post merger) **\~19.2% (dilution factor of about 5.2 or around 80.8% dilution)** of the company. This means currently at \~$48 a share the current marketcap is priced in at \~9.6B . Shares will automatically be converted to the stock ticker symbol $TMTG.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9ej6aby395t81.jpg?width=729&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7736963bc0de81800eff4a846aa61929a8fa8a64

The PIPE funding is the largest in history and will provide them with about $1B plus $300M from DWAC's trust. We'll talk more about the PIPE and potential investors later

# Basic Sector Understanding

Compared to its competitors Truthsocial has massive upside potential. For starters, TWTR IPO'd with zero profit for a marketcap, adjusted for inflation, of 30-40B . From our math from before, this translates into a \~3x-5x the current share price of \~$48, $162-216 a share.

Now let's take a look at the competitors

In October 2021 right before the TMTG announcement

FB Marketcap: 910B

TWTR Marketcap: 50B

PINS Marketcap: 34B

SNAP Marketcap: 85B

NFLX Marketcap: 295B

Present day

FB Marketcap: 528B

TWTR Marketcap: 26B

PINS Marketcap: 14.5B

SNAP: 46B

NFLX 150B

This translates into

FB: -42%

TWTR: -52%

PINS: -57%

SNAP: -54%

NFLX - 49%

Compare this to the Nasdaq

QQQ only -11.5% since Oct 20th, 2021

What this means is these companies should of only collectively lost

FB: 105B; TWTR: 6B; PINS: 4B; SNAP: 10B; NFLX: 34B

Instead they have lost

FB: 382B; TWTR: 24B; PINS 20B; SNAP: 39B; NFLX 145B

This a net difference of

FB: 277B; TWTR: 18B; PINS: 16B; SNAP: 29B; NFLX: 111B

For a grand total of $451B loss in only just under 5 months.

Where is this money going?

DWAC + 14B

AAPL + 105B at a time when it should be tracking -11.5% benchmark (loss 280B) so a net offset +385B

There's a lot of nuance to this because there are more companies that are not publicly traded or hard to track because they are apart of GOOG or DIS etc. (to be honest even the AAPL is a hard one to compare)

I'm guessing about $500-600B in related market competitors marketcap has disappeared in net ahead of their indexes since the threat of TMTG's competition has presented itself.

My latest reasoning for a lag in this flow of capital is liquidity issues and requirements that this smart money cannot dump into DWAC. It's too small a float, even post merger. It's also probably outside of their requirements and perceived risk tolerance since it's a SPAC and hasn't filed an S4 yet.

# Comparing The Fundamentals To Their Sector Competitors

I'm going to start with TMTG+ streaming services **(headed by the producer of America's Got Talent and Deal or No Deal)** since it's a much more simplistic model to users paying the company directly for its services.

Netflix - 214 Million Paid Subscribers (this one has lost some serious marketcap since my last DD, comparable to above numbers for the other sector competitors)

Disney+ - 118 Million Paid Subscribers

Hulu - 44 Million Paid Subscribers

Discovery+ - 15 Million Paid subscribers

Netflix has 167B marketcap compared to 222 Million Paid Subscribes. This translates to about $752 in market cap per subscriber.

Let's say TMTG+ achieves only 23M subscribers with only $600 per sub in marketcap . This alone would justify the current share price based off 14B marketcap.

Let's say TMTG+ achieves only 50M subscribers at only $600 per sub in marketcap. This alone would justify a \~2x increase in the share price based on a 30B marketcap.

Translating this aspect of the business you can roughly translate **every 10M TMTG+ subs to an additional $31 in share price.**

&#x200B;

Let's move forward to the Social Media aspect

Facebook - Dec 2021 - 2.89 B Monthly Active Users , 917 B marketcap, $317 per monthly user in marketcap. - Mar 2022 -  2.89 B Monthly Active Users , 582 B marketcap, $182 per monthly user in marketcap.

Youtube - 2 B Monthly Active Users (MAU), 500B marketcap, $250 per monthly user in marketcap.

Tiktok \~1B users, \~400B marketcap, \~$400/user

Snapchat \~347MAU \~ 58B marketcap \~ $167/user (down from 264 since Dec)

Twitter - 330M MAU, $30.5B marketcap, \~$92  user marketcap. (down from 100 since Dec)

You can see that some companies are more valuable than others because of success of monetization. some companies are valued a lot higher per user. Giving these a market cap weighted average is about \~$275 users/ marketcap (give or take a bit, the markets have been volatile)

I'm going to say TS, given its much higher APRU is going to actually be above average on this list. I said 100 per user back in Dec but given the latest info I'll get into I'm going to put this at 193 for now

This would mean 100M users would translate into 19.3B in marketcap. So **for about 100M users you can add an additional $100 to the share price.**

Let's talk about the news aspect of the business model.

Fox has a marketcap of 22.5B, lets say it achieves 25% of Fox's audience. That's an additional 5B in marketcap or **an additional $26 a share for every 25% of Fox's audience size from news. Or about $25 for every 500,000 viewers.** Also keep in mind Trump's rallies even now are getting a few million live viewers when you count all of his rallies across Rumble, Youtube, RSBN, OAN etc.

Don Junior is bringing an app to market called MxM which is an aggregator app to compete with Apple and Google news it's getting independent funding and may merge with TMTG in the future. Do a quick search on that.

Who knows what other business venture and revenue will be brought in.

# Key Performance Indicators

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qb8ie84595t81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f99d561af3dd32b979dfbadd759c1e60c3f9cbb

Here's a chart of projected revenue from the corporate slide deck you can find the SEC filings

These numbers are understated to be over delivered, clearly.

TS got 1.5B views in the first 24 hrs -Washington examiner (just on apple products, there are only 1.8B apple products.)

From the user feedback on Truthsocial so far, it has been demonstrated that users with way less followers are getting way more engagement. Maybe even by a factor of 10x less followers getting 10 x more engagement. This is huge for ARPU (average revenue per user)

Tracking Trump's followers from people in the app suggests the App just hit 1 million users in the first month despite being in a highly limited access period where people are getting mostly wait listed. Trump has \~700k followers using assumption that 70% of people are following Trump. Truth social is currently only available on the Apple App store and in the US for those on the waitlist. This should be opening very soon for web browser, android, and non-us as the infrastructure scales.

Extrapolating this growth rate has been done in a few ways

The current linear growth rate is something like 20M/yr even in this limited period. Which is astounding

However this rate has been increasing rapidly partly due to increase in infrastructure

Using a very aggressive approach (see the methodology in my post history)  Extrapolating Trump's Follower's Growth Report 3-21

13262e\^(0.175\*365.25)

It says Truth would surpass Facebook in only 71 Days. (assuming 100% following of users.. obviously less days when you use the 70% following Trump assumptions)

Lets be a little more conservative and use the polynomial

671.52x\^2+7553.7x+9074.4

That says

92M per a year, and that's with obvious near increases back to reverse of rate comparisons saying this will be even higher in the near term.

Using the 80% assumption this is 131M per year, a number which should easily increase before then (a new faster equation)

Also noting that this is for the first year. It would increase to a rate of 363M/yr by the second. 814M/yr by the third. And surpass Facebook around the Fourth or Fifth

Of course we'll need more time and data to come in to build further confidence in these models, confidence and data which I believe will shock the markets and potentially serve as a major catalyst.

The big opening was said to be before end of Q1 so I'm guessing that will be a big uptick in growth allowability in the next few weeks

For some comparisons

Path to 1M users

Tumblr 27 months

Twitter 24 months

Pinterest 20 months

Facebook 10 months

Dropbox 7 months

Spotify 5 months

Instagram 3 months

Truthsocial 1 month

I have not yet been able to find any service or platform to exceed these rate assuming they weren't using existing infrastructure such as AWS, which TS is not. It using Rumble's infrastructure

# Lets talk about Profit Margins

Truthsocial is actually much likelier to have a much higher profit margin than Twitter because of severely reduced operating expenses, and why TMTG will probably be trading at more comparable ratios to Facebook not because of success of monetization but because of success of low operating expenses.

First let me give you a peak into the burning dumpster fire that is Twitter's balance sheet

Starting on page 43 of Twitter's Annual Report from 2020 [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020\_Twitter\_Annual\_Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020_Twitter_Annual_Report.pdf)

We can see Twitter pulled in 3.2 B from Advertising Services, 508M from Data licensing for a total of 3.7B in revenue

1.37B Cost revenue

873M in 'Research and development'

888M in 'Sales and marketing'

562M in 'general and administrative'

Twitter netted negative 1.1B in profit after setting aside 1B for taxes.

Let's break this down again

Twitter pulled in $3.7B but twitter spent

37% on cost of revenue: servers, buildings, upkeep etc.

23% on Research and development: software engineers, sociologists, artists, focus groups (market research) (I believe moderators is in here as well)

24% on Sales and marketing: sales employees for ads and marketing for userbase and available ad space.

15% of general and administrative: executives, legal, finance, info tech, hr, consulting, moderators (in both categories probably), customer service etc.

3% on interest and other: interest on debt financing, operations etc.

29% on taxes.

Yes these numbers add to 131% of revenue or in other words a 31% net income loss.

Why is Twitter so expensive to run, why is this dumpster fire losing all of this money?

Lets go back in time to Twitter in 2011-2013 - Here's the same report from that time period. [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf)

Page 57

Going to compare to Twitters Monthly active users (MAU) [https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:\~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)).

2013: \~225M monthly active users (MAU)

Cost of Revenue : 266 M (\~330M inflation adjusted)

Research and Development.(R&D): 593M (\~740M inflation adjusted)Sales and Marketing 316M (\~400M inflation adjusted)General and Administrative 124M (\~160M inflation adjusted)

2011: \~100M MAU

Cost of Revenue: 62M (\~85M inflation adjusted)

R&D: 80M (\~110M inflation adjusted)

Sales and marketing 26M (\~36M inflation adjusted)

General and administrative 233M (\~310M inflation adjusted)

Ok so lets do some ratios with inflation adjusted numbers compared to users

2020: \~330M MAU

Cost of revenue: \~$4.15 per monthly active user

R&D: \~$2.65 per monthly active user

Sales and marketing: $2.7 per monthly active user

General and admin: $1.7 per monthly active user

2013: \~225M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)

Cost of revenue: \~$1.47 per monthly active user

R&D: \~$3.29 per monthly active user

Sales and marketing: \~$1.78 per monthly active user

General and admin: \~$0.71 per monthly active user

2011: \~100M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)

Cost of revenue: \~$0.85 per monthly active user

R&D: \~$1.10 per monthly active user

Sales and marketing: \~$0.36 per monthly active user

General and admin: \~$0.85 per monthly active user

So what's alarming about this trend is that twitter is becoming very expensive to operate on a per MAU basis.

Let's recap

Cost of revenue went from $0.85 in 2011 per user to $4.15/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **388% increase**

R&D went from $1.10/user in 2011 to $2.65/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **141% increase**

Sales and marketing went from $0.36/user in 2011 to $2.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **650% increase**

And general and admin from $0.85/user in 2011 to $1.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **100% increase**

Let's see how Facebook does from their annual reports [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/14039b47-2e2f-4054-9dc5-71bcc7cf01ce.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/14039b47-2e2f-4054-9dc5-71bcc7cf01ce.pdf)

(M&S) Marketing and sales: 14B - $4.81/user

(G&A) General and Admin: 9.8B - $3.37/user

Let's compare to an earlier time [https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc\_financials/annual\_reports/FB\_2012\_10K.pdf](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/annual_reports/FB_2012_10K.pdf)

Page 58 and [https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/) (for MAU half way down)

2012: \~1B MAU (inflation adjusted)

CoR: 1364M (\~1730M) - \~$1.73 per user

R&D: 1399M (\~1800M) - \~$1.80/user

M&S: 896M (\~1150M) - \~$1.15/user

G&A: 892M (\~1140M) - \~$1.14/user

2010: \~500M MAU

M&S: 167M (\~225M) - \~$0.45/user

G&A: 138M (\~190M) - $0.38/user

As you can see, much like twitter, Facebook also suffers from huge inflated costs over the years of running their business.

I suspect this has a lot to do with financing of their servers through amortization payments.

But also trying to scale their business with the technology that was available 10+ years ago and not being able to change their business model because it was bad PR to fire off tens of thousands people and replace them with future technology, they've essentially been forced to grow with their existing business modeling scaling up which you can see results in worse and eventually negative margins.

Now we are talking about a brand new company with no existing dogmatic or scalability issues

They have already touted using AI in place of manual moderation

Their infrastructure that is based by Rumble has been touting as being 8x cheaper than AWS, a huge expense on these legacy media companies.

Facebook has 45,000 employees (1 employee for every \~65,000 users)

Twitter has 5,500 employees (1 employee for every \~60,000 users)

Facebook has much greater success of monetization than Twitter

Truthsocial will likely have similar success of monetization like Twitter except it will have substantially higher margins than both via means of reduced expenditures (cheaper servers) and utilizing AI in place of many employees. This also brings down the cost of office space etc. with remote work and fewer headcount.

This is one of the things they fear more than even the political ramifications is becoming obsolete in superior utilization of technology which they have can kicked to avoid a PR nightmare.

It would be much harder and more expensive to program an AI to be biased towards political ideas instead of more hard set rules of logic. It would require constant upkeep to keep up with flip flopping rules and exemptions etc. An AI would be a much more solid long lasting algorithm if it was free from these ever changing agendas.

In other words being woke will be obsolete by superior unbiased artificial intelligence. Also selection of ad space being removed from political and PR expense etc. nonsense. The free market will bid up ad-space and engagement to increase naturally from a more exciting and free environment free from biased and expensive bureaucratic moderation and selection.

# Lets Talk Share Price

So currently the markets are priced at \~72 a share would would translate to something like

40M TS users ($40) + 8M TMTG+ subs ($25) + 4% of Fox's audience ($4.16), \~ $69

You can see this is a bit comical for what's being priced in for a someone who is as well known as DJT who had over 150M followers online and over 71M votes in his 2nd run for president. We've all seen the portfolio trackers and many others get banned off TWTR lately. Pelosi tracker is back up on Truthsocial already

Here's a potential scenario

300M TS users (\~1/10th of facebook) ($300) + 25M TMTG+ subs ($77.5) + 50% Fox Audience ($52) = $429.5 and still have massive room for improvement

More scenarios

600M TS users (\~1/5th of facebook) ($600) + 40M TMTG+ subs ($124) + 50% Fox Audience ($52) = $776 a share and still have massive room for improvement

A total blow out of just one of the aspects

1B TS users (\~1/3rd of facebook) ($1000) + 40M TMTG+ subs ($124)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = **$1228 a share**

Another example

300M TS users (\~1/10th of facebook) ($300) + 60M TMTG+ subs ($186) + 100% Fox Audience ($104) ($52) = $590 and still have massive room for improvement

Imagine in these scenarios it will be trading for much more aggressive ratios **so**

# DWAC 1000

with much additional upside after on fundamentals is not a mathematical challenge.

1.5B TS users (\~1/2 of facebook) ($1500) + 100M TMTG+ subs ($310)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = \~**$2000 a share**

3B TS users (\~1/2 of facebook) ($3000) + 100M TMTG+ subs ($310)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = \~**$3414 a share**

3B TS users (\~entire market) ($3000) + 250M (entire market) TMTG+ subs ($775)  + Above Fox Audience ($400)  = \~**$4200 a share** along way to go to get there

# Who else is bullish

Kevin O'Leary from shark tank has said this is ""going to work"" search of O'Leary DWAC.

Speculated Possible/Likely of the 36 PIPE investors to be disclosed (another catalyst): Lutnick, Thiel, Musk, Schnatter, Chamath, White, McMahon, Salman,, Steve Wynnn, Bernard Marcus, Roger Penske, Carln Icahn, Rex Tillerson, Lindell . More info about these people in my post history and why, at least in some cases like Lutnick, Musk, and Thiel there is a lot of info to suggest this is probably true

# Short Interest and Gamma Ramp

There's been reported to be about 4-5M Shares shorted on this low 28.7M float. A recipe for disaster for shorts. Is also on the reghso FTD list

\~4M in SI and \~1M in FTD. At least. It's also been hypothesized that the market markers are only holding \~4-5M shares based on Liquidity Pool (LP) Theory Math (see post history) this would mean the Short to Liquidity Pool ratio is over 100%, reported SI is 13.4%, Days to Cover Ratio \~2, basically no shares left to borrow (100% utilization), cost to borrow is \~70% but has been seen usually above 100% and has gone as high as >300% at some points.

# FUD

**Addressing common FUD - Understanding actual risk and nonsensical Fear Uncertainty and Doubt**

I know many reading this will get very emotional both long and short and will look for any reason to make this sound bigger or smaller or impossible or dumb. There's also many people who do not want this to happen for their own personal benefits. So here's some common things that are said and a general counter to it.

**FUD:** ""People won't want to advertise there""

**Counter**: According to CNN facebook was never at risk of this. This rhetoric never had much grounds in reality

>Facebook generated $69.7 billion from advertising in 2019, more than 98% of its total revenue for the year. And most of those ad dollars don't come from companies like Starbucks ([SBUX](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=SBUX&source=story_quote_link)) and Coca Cola so much as the sprawling list of small and medium-sized businesses who use Facebook to attract customers and build their brands.when COO Sheryl Sandberg said the top 100 advertisers represented ""less than 20%"" of total ad revenue.📷The Facebook ad boycott is starting to rattle investors""Facebook has an enormous number of advertiser clients,"" said Nicole Perrin, an analyst at eMarketer. ""They're definitely pretty reliant on the long tail of small business advertisers.""

&#x200B;

>Even as Facebook confronts by far the largest advertiser boycott in its history, the sheer number of advertisers on its platform may insulate the company from too much financial fallout. At the same time, it remains an open question whether many big and small advertisers can afford to stay away from the powerful platform it built for very long

&#x200B;

>""I think it's relatively unlikely that small businesses \[and\] small brands will join the boycott, because they're the ones most reliant on Facebook for access to their customers,"" Perrin said.

CNN's website  slash 2020/06/30/tech/facebook-ad-business-boycott/index.html

**Counter:** There will be direct monetization outside of ads (see TMTG+ section) also Companies will have to go where people are advertising with their attention and dollars. It's easy for companies to dissociate from where their ads are located when the free market forces their hand. ""Our ads are located in places that do not represent our beliefs as a company, we are solely interested in providing business to our customers despite their personal identities"" ""

**FUD:** ""\*The merger might fail or get blocked resulting in this going bad.""\*

**Counter**: SPACs don't fail for the reasons described or eluded to by the outlets. [u/independence\_hall](https://www.reddit.com/u/independence_hall/) has a great post ""The SEC and FINRA DO NOT have the legal authority or power to block the DWAC/TMTG merger"" please see his post history and read it. He did the leg work and debunked this. It's almost a zero chance of happening. See posts  \*\*""\*\*An update to my SEC/FINRA inquiry post and possible S-4 timeline "" and "" The SEC and FINRA DO NOT have the legal authority or power to block the DWAC/TMTG merger. Another COMPLETE breakdown of the SEC/FINRA inquiry, and how the SEC ALREADY APPROVED A SPAC MERGER in the past that was sanctioned by the SEC for lying to its investors.""

**FUD**: The roll out has been slow and unsuccessful

**Counter:** Actually no it has been record breaking and see the part of the DD above about growth rate projections. Anyone who doesn't understand this is comparing to AWS or existing infrastructure rollouts. I have not yet had one person point me to a valid example of a new platform or service rolling out faster at its inception with its own infrastructure. Also this platform was said be rolled out by end of Q1. It is not end of Q1 yet. TS got 1.5B views in the first 24 hrs -washington examiner (just on apple products, there are only 1.8B apple products.)

**FUD:** They Have Offices in Wuhan

**Counter:** So do: IBM, Deloitte, EY, Huawei, PwC, HSBC, Walmart, Fedex, Hewlet Packard, Pfizer, Apple, Uber, Starbucks, Procter and Gamble, Cummins, Morgan Stanley, Siems, Byte Dance, KFC, Motorola, Nissan, Alibaba, NIO,

**FUD:** ""Trump doesn't know what he's doing he can't even open email""

**Counter:** Trump just got over a billion in PIPE funding (largest in SPAC history). There's plenty of well paid people with the right background on the company. Trump is largely here for traction, which is the primary issue all social media companies face.

&#x200B;

There's also an agreement with Rumble to use their services

Also Lmao, linkedIn etc. FUD is nonsense, these guys are under NDA and are in the top 1 percentile of talent, networks not bound to these nonsense companies are not the sole arbiters of resources

**FUD:** ""This will be GAB/Parler 2.0 failure""

**Counter:** TMTG+ and the other services are nothing like the markets that these are in. Secondly Parler was becoming massively successful very quickly before it was pulled from the app store and AWS violated contract removing it. Parler is back now. TMTG is safe . Also it's likely Apple and TMTG have a deal since it seems everything is an Apple exclusive at first and their marketcap has been doing well (see that section in the above DD)

>**What Happened:** According to a [Variety](https://www.benzinga.com/)report citing data from the analytics firm **Conviva**, **World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.'s** (NYSE:[WWE](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/WWE#NYSE)) **WrestleMania 38** drew a combined 2.2 billion impressions across all social media platforms in its April 9-10 presentation, whereas the **NFL’s Super Bowl LVI** brought in 1.8 billion impressions on Feb. 13.

>Everyone wants to know what is on Truthsocial, it is the digital platform for the entire reformed republican party with the midterms coming up. It is highly relevant in the culture war and the reimplantation of fair meritocracy based content (that is aside from politics) the removal of shadow banning, bots, and algorithmic manipulation. There has never been an agreed centralized effort for everyone to regroup. It doesn't become relevant until traction is there.

&#x200B;

# Rumble Reports added 9M users QoQ , 22% QoQ

**FUD:** ""Trump steaks""

**Counter:** Trump steaks and the other very few things like 'From the Desk' that were unsuccessful account for a very small percentage of his ventures. Those are also very different products in very different markets. Investigate this further if you still think it's relevant, you'll be surprised the actual facts and not what low effort FUDs would have you believe.

*The master has failed more times than the novice has tried.*

**FUD:** ""Myself and other have moral/ethical dilemmas because of our ideology""

**Counter:** I'm not here to argue with you to try to show you why everything is wrong, it's a simple observation that at minimum hundreds of millions of people disagree with you and there is a massive market for it and a demand.

**FUD:** ""Open source"" ""Bad security"" ""Software licensing""

**Counter:** Source is released and posted, security is fine. Android and Linux are OS as are many projects. There's billions in funding, tech people have already solved this issues for many other services. The issue is Traction. That's where Trump comes in. Rumor of Thiel involvement (he was raising money for campaigning with DJT junior recently)  I wouldn't be surprised if Palantir is involved in some way for security.

I'll add a lot more to this since I'm sure there will be plenty more to come.

**FUD**

Drop in downloads etc.

**Counter**

It's in load test phase, and still the fastest growing platform in history. Do your own research, fake news would have you buy Twitter right now while it's about to get clapped.

**Conclusion**

There's a lot of upside and demand that isn't priced in IMHO

I have shares, warrants, and calls and I believe full launch may cause a massive surge in price expectations once more hard data rolls in (in the coming weeks), if not then by the time the revenue rolls in.  The risks are often nonsensical or overstated by people with strong opposing political ideology and lack of financial and technological understandings.

The attempt of the top mods to remove all of us and censor you failed, thanks to the actions of the reddit admins. We are grateful to everyone in the community who stood up for us.

Unfortunately, /u/zjz will also not be allowed to come back to moderate the subreddit. This is a decision made by reddit, not us, due to the instability that was created by his last post on the subreddit. We know the respect that you all have for him, each one of us mods has that respect for him too. The hard work and time that /u/zjz put into the subreddit cannot be replaced, but we will try our best to keep the subreddit up to his lofty standards and our high expectations.

Moving forward, we are working harder than ever and we need your help. Since /u/zjz ran all of our bots and was also the most active mod, there is a massive void left by his absence. If anyone has the desire to code a new bot for us and/or the time to moderate, as well as the experience on WSB (at least one year), we would appreciate your help.

kqlnjn,2021-01-05 00:04:28,Why a Dem Sweep could Spell BIG BIG Trouble for Tech beyond Tax Increases,"As of late, Democrats have surged in the Georgia Senate run-offs, which could spell big trouble for tech companies sporting lofty valuations, especially non-profitable ones.

So why exactly does a Blue Wave spell trouble for tech companies?

A couple reasons: more fiscal spending, higher inflation expectations, higher interest rates, less valuable long-term cashflows, tech trade crowding, and hedge fund leverage. Let me explain.

&#x200B;

**Fiscal Spending, Inflation, and Interest Rates**

Generally speaking, Democratic policy favors a large government budget, and with hopes to spend over $5T on clean energy/infrastructure, education, and healthcare Biden's team isn't breaking from the mold. A blue wave would make it much easier for the Biden administration to enact these policies. While Biden is planning on increasing taxes by $3.4T to offset his spending, the government still needs to create money to finance these projects, which leads to inflation. Moreover, the Fed has taken a newly lax stance on its price stability mandate, and is welcoming inflation of more than 2%, so it won't hesitate to let prices run hot to achieve its inflation target. 10 yr bond yields (and interest rates broadly) tend to be highly correlated to measures of inflation, as its a natural way to dampen the acceleration of rising prices. 

Summary: dem sweep = higher fiscal spending = higher inflation = higher interest rates

**How This Affects Tech Stock Valuation**

For all the retards who have never taken a finance course or don't understand basic valuation techniques, the essence of stock valuation is projecting future free cash flows and discounting them back at a risk adjusted rate (b/c $1 is worth more today than $1 five yrs from now, and there's not 100% certainty in the CFs the company might produce in the future). Thus, the main determinant of a company's value is its profitability, the rate at which you discount the company's cash flows, and the time horizon you analyze it at (which can be related to the discount rate). For those actually interested, you can read more here. With the current fed funds rate pinned between 0% and .25% and the 10yr yield less than 1%, you can practically look out at a time horizon of 10-20 years before discounting back cash flows. Though still a stretch, interest rates at this level might be able to justify some of the 30-50x price/sales multiples we see in certain growthy tech names at the moment (DDOG's, CRWD's, etc). 

That said, if interest rates do begin to rise as a result of a blue sweep, and analysts are forced to incorporate risk free rates of 2-3+% into their discount rates at time horizons where these companies generate little profit, tech companies could see their valuation multiples deteriorate by 50+%. Even just pre-Covid valuation multiples for some growthy names would absolutely crush their stock price. I understand Covid brought forward significant demand for tech companies and in many ways permanently altered consumer behavior, but much of the rise of these companies is based on pure multiple expansion on the basis of forward revenues (not even earnings!), assuming low discount rates and near-infinite time horizons. 

**Crowded Long Tech Trade**

It's no real surprise, but according to a December BofA survey, the long technology strategy is the most popular/crowded among fund managers. Also, a year-end Morgan Stanley report indicated that hedge fund gross and net exposure was near all-time highs at 100% and 96%ile, respectively.

**A Quick Note on Leverage**

Hedge funds use leverage to amplify returns, and when leverage is cheap (see above), they are more keen to do so. If a hedge fund is levered at 2x, it has $100 of capital to support $200 of positions. A 10% drawdown would leave the fund with $80 of capital to support $180 of positions, with a new leverage multiple of 2.25x. If this were to happen, the fund would have to sell roughly 20% of its book to maintain its leverage ratio. In such a crowded trade, selling like this would cause another fund to liquidate a portion of its holdings to not become over levered, and this self-sustaining cycle of selling persists. An example of this price action and positive feedback loop is the ""Quant Quake"" of 2007 though its trade was less crowded and firms were probably more highly levered.

**Conclusion/TLDR**

A blue wave and higher interest rates (or even the fear/expectation thereof) could quickly unravel the long technology trade due to its crowding, leverage, and a newfound preference for shorter duration cash flows, crushing the stock prices of many tech companies, especially those that are unprofitable in the near term.

Things started slowing down in July and recently everything has straight up collapsed in August. Job postings that used to have less than 100 applicants have more than 300.

ngftx1,2021-05-19 20:14:45,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer...","Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I’m sure there’s someone else who also remembers and can corroborate – and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can’t imagine this post won’t make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show – think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most “amazing” woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don’t know – why would I know?”, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous – it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn’t even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim’s continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife – and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle – I don’t think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim’s enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don’t blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",6,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngftx1/funny_true_albeit_sad_story_about_mr_cramer/,wallstreetbets

[cost to borrow for $AMC trending up](https://preview.redd.it/85pa5wigo8t91.png?width=967&format=png&auto=webp&s=f65482309e906676c3f38937c94c88f9958b7f9c)

**Cost to borrow:** Annual fee paid to borrow shares and use those shares to short the stock. The fee that the borrowers are paying are approximately 20%. For well over a year its been approximately 0.5-1%. 

Between the bounces of $50-$30 last year the cost to borrow was approx 1% which is $0.30-$0.50 per share. Currently we have 100% utilization since February. The current price is approx $6, 20% of $6 is $1.20 per share to borrow for a year in comparison to the 30-50 cents they paid last year. 

Short sellers renewing positions need to borrow at higher rates.

When a stock tanks and hits its low, in the brains of many WSBers... the stock is done. Why buy? 

Yet that should be the opposite mentality people have. AMC hasn't had any bad news for it to come this low, so the price action seems mostly short and not fundamental. What does a short seller do when a stock hits its low? Same thing a long investor does when it peaks. **CLOSE POSITION**

**How do short sellers make money?** 

They make money in two ways, first is by closing position at it's lowest point and second would be by synthetic shorting via options and selling OTM calls to do so. The problem here is the cost to borrow is getting expensive. synthetic shorting seems to be hitting a wall with the price not getting lower, the IV is low as hell so they arent profiting. Sooner, rather then later... the stock might have no where else to go but go up.

Now here's the thing... if it goes up from here, options are dirt cheap to exercise. Comparable to $50 \[$5,000\] per contract to exercise... it only costs approx $600 to exercise. If this thing were to rip, things could get crazy quick, exercising is cheapest its been in a LONG time.

This is why I am bullish on $AMC.

I am also bullish on $GME. Take a look at the DTC/SIR \[over 15\] and SI at 20%.",3,0.52,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1ka6s/why_is_amc_prime_to_go/,wallstreetbets

Hi

the recently leaked documents from Russian embassies indicate that the war between the NATO/Ukraine and Russia is inevitable.

My question would be how we can profit from the war and not only protect our money but make more.

I am located in Germany so my idea would be to invest in American and Russian defense companies.

Post war resources are required to re-build infrastructure, so I guess steel, forest, water, electricity, oil would be required.

What else did I miss.

ovp1ni,2021-08-01 09:19:47,short or stay clear of TLRY,"TLRY has become a meme stock with not much behind it. they put out great headlines but at the end of the day, they aren't doing well enough to any way justify their valuation. and this has been going on for awhile. 

a quick look at their fins says it all. before merger

aphria sold 41m usd in weed last quarter
tlry sold 31 million

after merger, they recently reported 52m in weed sales which accounted for 100% apha and 4wks worth of tlry. which meant they were flat in sales qoq. these are like tier 3 mso numbers. 

on top of which, they're carrying about 3b in good will (most of it came from tlry) and 250m of weed inventory.  at their sales rate, it would take them over 2yrs to sell that. more than likely they would need to write down a signifcant portion of that inventory at some point. 

and they're valued at 7b. 

now they're looking to dilute further for some red herring that looks like mso acquisition but still smells like herring. truth is 1) they need to continue to acquire to grow rev to (hopefully, but doubtful)  justify their valuation since they can't sell weed (remember flat qoq growth and ballooning inventory) 2) they can't afford a tier 1 or 2 mso. 

institutional investors only hold about 10% of their float which is among the lowest of their peers. hell even aurora is 18% (which, in itself, is lunacy). canopy is about 25%. village farms near 40%. 10% are mso numbers and msos trade on the OTC where most funds can't invest!

skip the company pr, look at the official fins, check out their valuation, compare their numbers to any mso, and you'll come to the same conclusions. 

oh, and the current ceo makes outlandish money https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/ouspzi/-/h762qcd.  note that the old tlry ceo Brendan Kennedy continues to dump his shares faster than you can say weedstocks. the guy is no dummy https://wallmine.com/people/64826/brendan-kennedy

the only upside is that they're heavily shorted so can run up wildly like we saw with their recent er. but once people digested their fins (which were released after hours when their headline numbers were released premarket lol), looks like reality is setting in.

ojpr1n,2021-07-13 21:43:52,SPCE Hypersonic plane,"Jeff Bezos is trying to down play Sir Richard Branson & Virgin Galactic's outstanding performance traveling into outer space this past weekend. 

Jeff Bezos is saying ""50 miles up is not outer space, but that 60 miles up is outer space."" Meanwhile when Bezos goes up (which won't happen because he's afraid to even get an elevator) they'll be going to the same threshold between 50 and 60 miles. The average person traveling into space without proper conditioning, will not be able to handle anything past that. 

While Sir Richard Branson has always been well ahead in the game. The comments from bezos show he hasn't been able to get over it, with all the excitement and news Virgin Galactic has posted and received. 

Virgin Galactic's plane was designed for hypersonic speed. Hypersonic flight is coming. The idea of a nice jaunt into outer space for a joyride sounds fun, nevertheless soon people are going to be able to take hypersonic planes as a means of transportation anywhere in the world within two ~ four hours flight time. That's the goal. 

There's also a big difference in the designs between all three space companies. Virgin Galactic is following the X aircraft design, specifically the Boeing X-20 Dyno. The other space companies are using old Apollo technology with a capsule perched a top a rocket that comes back through the upper atmosphere with parachutes deployed landing wherever the wind takes you. 

The most important part of Virgin Galactic's hypersonic plane design is the feathering braking system that lets the plane float down through the atmosphere like a badminton birdie. The feathering system is based on Rutan's designs. The entire tail structure can rotate upward, giving the plane the ability to slow down and float like a feather as it re-enters the upper atmosphere. The plane then lands on a runway. I'll take the plane and land on a runway.",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ojpr1n/spce_hypersonic_plane/,wallstreetbets

* The public share price during the partnership share to company share conversion
* The gross profit of the company during that Q
* And the applicable tax rate for that company

For $PRPL, good news is that on Q3 2020, the Pearce brothers had exited and converted 99% of their type B shares in Innohold to PRPL, with 99% of the possible TRA already reflected in the liabilities there won't be much surprises going forward. The not so good news, there's still about 130 MM USD left that will eat into $PRPL earnings the next few quarters.

The Share conversions and subsequent sales besides triggering the TRA also triggered an incremental loan warrant strike reprice, This is different from the public stock warrants, it is the warrant related to the loan that PRPL received from Coliseum and Blackwell in 2018. They usually put this sort of terms in the loan to prevent founders cashing out early. According to the GAAP Accounting Standards Codification 480,

[https://cpaclass.com/gaap-accounting-standards/codification-400/asc-codification-topic-480.htm](https://cpaclass.com/gaap-accounting-standards/codification-400/asc-codification-topic-480.htm)

you need to record the fair value of this as a liability. Unlike the TRA, you can calculate the warrant liabilities more accurately, usually they do it using Monte Carlo instead of BSM. Here's an excel sheet that does Monte Carlo pricing though it doesn't account for reprice probability yet

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paeexI0jD6mlj9n-me59tS4IPpq3bARJ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paeexI0jD6mlj9n-me59tS4IPpq3bARJ/view?usp=sharing)

And here's a pdf that details Monte Carlo for warrants

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVEblipoBpvz35c\_Zw0nYl2VzhIxY-TH/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVEblipoBpvz35c_Zw0nYl2VzhIxY-TH/view?usp=sharing)

The May 2020 share sales of the Pearce brothers triggered that reprice clause and reset the warrant strike to zero. So for PRPL since the strike is 0 and event reprice probability is over 90% with near DTE, you can just multiple the number of outstanding loan warrants x the current share price to get an accurate estimate. in Q3 2020, it was 24.86 x 2.6 = 64.6 Million. For Q4, since share price have increased further to $31, the warrant liabilities would be 31 x 2.6 = 80.6, a difference of about 16 MM USD from the previous Q. this is reflected in the statements of operations, dragging the EPS lower.

Friday's Incident

>Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator Mike Whitaker said  on  Saturday that the agency is requiring immediate inspections of  certain  planes before they can return to flight. The order impacts 171 aeroplanes worldwide. **Required inspections will take around four to eight hours per aircraft.**

Current incident is priced in, the Alaskan inspection is surface level. Not like  they're gonna strip and inspect every rivet behind the plastic within 4  hours.

A Few years ago. 2018 crashes

>The aircraft were cleared to fly again after Boeing overhauled an   automated flight-control system that activated erroneously in both  (2018) crashes.

Thoughts:

Overall sounds like shotty craftmanship and corners were cut on the  engineering of the MAX's. Longterm the depreciation on the planes will be sped up. **Just drop the price of these assets (planes) on the balance sheet to zero.**

Real Issue will be what the full FAA investigation will reveal. FAA may ground the fleet to inspect every rivet. which will take half a year rather than the 3 days surface inspection to just make people feel safe.

17bqia0,2023-10-19 18:51:59,"RIVN today is like TSLA in 2019, don't miss this boat 50+ by 2025","# My history on $TSLA

When tesla first launched the model 3, seeing in person reservations line throughout the mall, I started really looking into Tesla stock, fast forward to 2019, I went all in (and made this reddit account: TSLA4LIFE1), I sold some pre-COVID rally and model 3, but quickly re-bought during the downturn, and then sold some after first split to put it into WSB's favourite stock of 2021.

# Current problems with TSLA

Coming to today, I'm starting to see lots of similarity in $RIVN both on the numbers and valuation side, and also on the products, innovation, feedback, and demand side. There is no doubt $TSLA has been struggling and just offering price cuts to justify selling basically the same model 3 from 2018 in 2023. What was way ahead of the competition in 2018, is now barely on par, thus needing price cuts to justify the purchase.

# RIVN Demand

Rivian on the other hand, cant produce enough of their first vehicle - R1T, let alone the crazy demand, wait, and hype for the full sized SUV - R1S. Their products consistently get good reviews, have great quality, and are like nothing on the market.

Rivians are not only praised as top of the line tech, but also praised as amazing vehicles by Car enthusiasts, which is something Tesla always lacked.

&#x200B;

# RIVN Stock

So we have shown above that RIVN is a good company with good products, but is it a good stock? A good stock is a good company at a GOOD price.

&#x200B;

$Rivn was hit heavily with their recent news of offering $1.5 Billion of converting debt, which is maturing 2030. The stock is since down massively due to people thinking this was out of the blue, but as previously communicated this was expected sometime in 2024.

&#x200B;

Looking into the above I wanted to take a look at how RIVN was currently valued compared to TSLA:

[RIVN vs TSLA P\/S ratio](https://preview.redd.it/2p7ol800h7vb1.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b863bd29d2d37c264486bacdfe07a85d078749a)

&#x200B;

For pre income and heavy growth companies (RIVN today and 2019 TSLA) it always makes sense to use P/S ratio (MKT Cap/Revenue), and as seen above, from this metric currently the market has a 50% discount on RIVN compared to TSLA.

&#x200B;

# Cash on hand

&#x200B;

[RIVN vs TSLA Cash on hand](https://preview.redd.it/qwax3jl0h7vb1.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=67f9f20bf65a371b243174fc494b2382e482dd7e)

&#x200B;

RIVN has a MKT cap of $**16.512B** and cash on hand of $10.2B, compared to TSLA's MKT cap of $**692.374B** and cash on hand of $23B, so a 42x bigger MKT cap, but only 2x the cash on hand. This eliminates fear of further needing to raise cash for a while, and further strengthens RIVN's valuation vs TSLA.

&#x200B;

# Revenue growth vs. margin growth

Rivn is growing revenues faster than tesla, while their COGS is going up less than Tesla, now what does this mean? -> Better margins. Although still negative for RIVN, they are on the right track, and even as ELON keeps blaming the current macro environment, RIVN is dealing with the same macro, yet somehow increasing their top and bottom lines at a better pace then TSLA

&#x200B;

# Price targets and how long to hold

Now RIVN still has a long way to go, and I'm not trying to justify nor buying RIVN for the long term. I see the stock at a discount currently, but also realize it has room to fall back to mid teens. However, on the upside, I can see a massive run of 50+ before 2025, which is what my target is.

Many people got married to Tesla, which went from a good to great company, while the stock went from attractive, to extremely overvalued. Yet, many initial investors fell into the trap on not realizing that great companies as shit prices are shit stocks.

&#x200B;

I will keep increasing my position on the way down, and start legging out profits at $50+

lfu7mj,2021-02-09 04:08:00,Extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds,"The title of Charles MacKay’s book keeps echoing in my head as I watch the GME crowd continue to desperately milk what’s left of probably the best trade this century. A trade that should have been closed for 1000% profit 2 weeks ago. A beautiful trade in it’s sheer naked autism that has transformed itself into one of the most grotesque, greed fueled market delusions I have ever witnessed.

It’s become increasingly hard to stand by and watch tens of thousands of people, most of them with little to no experience trading or investing shout into an echo chamber of disinformation, the likes of which hasn’t been seen since Trump convinced his supporters to storm the Capitol in desperate attempts to overturn a lost election. While others, that actually know better and understand what a bubble is, ignore their better instincts and continue to buy and hold a stock out of spite for an invisible enemy.

I feel like I may have played a VERY small part in this with my CNBC open letter than went viral on twitter and helped turn our beloved gambling ring into a political movement. As one retard here put it, “this is not Occupy Wall St. This is Wallstreetbets, we fucking love Wall St.” So with that said I’m making a last ditch effort to hopefully wake people up and correct posts that are rife with outright false claims that are passing as DD.

People claiming that hedge funds are using options illegally to cover short positions deserve to be fucked in the street in front of the NYSE. There is nothing illegal about using options to neutralize portfolio risk. Everyone can do this, including you. Every brokerage lists this as a synthetic stock position under their ‘how to use options’ section. 

People claiming “sHoRtS hAvEn’T cOvErEd YeT” despite data released by the exchanges and S3 short interest data are also repeating outright lies and also need to have their butthole fisted by Warren Buffet.

On a final note, I’m going to leave the 5 stages of bubbles here. Let me know if you recognize any of these.

**1. Displacement**

A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a trade.

**2. Boom**

Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question (GME) attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.

**3. Euphoria**

During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and [metrics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the [""greater fool"" theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp)—the idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more—plays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.﻿ Similarly, at the height of the [internet bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internet-bubble.asp) in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) was higher than the GDP of most nations.

**4. Profit-Taking**

In this phase, the [smart money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-money.asp)—heeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point—starts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) put it, ""the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

**5. Panic**

It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with [margin calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after [Lehman Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp) declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance. In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.

GME is turning what was a good idea into something resembling a 2007 toxic mortgage backed security. For those that bought under $40, well played, you did good. For those that bought over $300 and are still holding.

labtag,2021-02-01 19:32:14,REMX - The less volatile way to play derivates (rare earth metals) of the EV and Renewable Energy craze?,"*\[Posted this on another Stock Market subreddit accidentally (now deleted from there)\]*  

Disclaimer: Do your own DD. I am not a licensed/certified financial advisor. This is not financial advice. Just may personal point of view.

\*\*\*

[REMX](https://www.vaneck.com/etf/equity/remx/holdings/) is a Rare Earth Metals ETF that gives any portfolio broad exposure to all major rare earth metal miners and players in China, Australia and some more (e.g US including Lithium Americas and Livent).

This saves one from the hassle of trying to track individual Chinese or Australian RE mining / metal extraction companies while giving access to an industry that will be a key supplier to the EV market in China and abroad. The output of these companies is also critical for the renewable energy (wind) sector and electronics to a certain extent.

For all the talk of the US bringing back supply chains (or relying on MP materials), this is one sector that cannot be brought back in the immediate to short term. The ETF hit highs of 92 in Jan 2018 and I expect that in a high liquidity environment with policy emphasis on electrification it will touch and exceed those levels. The ATH of 2011 is 300+ but I am not sure how relevant that might be today (but is a technical indication of the last time we had a media driven rare earth metals craze).

In summary

\- If you are not sure which Rare Earth mining company to pick or you want exposure to the EV secular shift but are not sure which SPAC or EV maker will go to the moon, consider REMX (rare earth metals ETF)  
\- Solid performer over the last months, currently going through a pullback (83 to 75)  
\- Moves slow but steady and has strong tailwinds  
\- Not super volatile so easier to get out of if you find a new shiny thing  
\- OTM calls are cheap  
\- Most recent high within the last 2 years was 92

Full disclosure: I have one deep ITM call for Aug 2021 and some shares (small account holder). The ETF has done nicely for me over the last few months (got in at 40), and this current pullback might be a good time to buy.",9,0.54,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labtag/remx_the_less_volatile_way_to_play_derivates_rare/,wallstreetbets

FYI That’s an extra 15% of the shares outstanding already in the company And that is NOT a number to take lightly. But that’s not the main point of this 

The main point of this is if your bagholding here already don’t be a fool and get dumped on twice. When Ryan filed to sell his shares he did it IMMEDIATELY. There was no 90 day wait period or whatever BS the hopium dreamers was shouting about. He sold IMMEDIATELY.

With that in mind you should be extremely cautious about the company doing the exact same thing. They know the price of the stock right now is way higher than it should be. True it may down 70% from its recent highs but it’s still higher than it was after their recent earnings report. Which means it’s the PERFECT time for the company to sell some stock. Not going to tell you what to do with your shares but I will say don’t say you weren’t warned about what could very well happen. Short interest is not and it never will be an excuse to baghold shares till $0. Shorts do not have to cover just like you do not have to sell. And short interest doesn’t mean Jack if there’s no positive momentum to actually take advantage of it.

1arrumb,2024-02-15 22:12:18,"NVIDIA will cross 2,000$","NVIDIA is going to cross 2,000$

Listen up regards, today lord Sam 7 trillion Altman of OpenAI released an AI model to send YouTube creators out of business. (Link : https://openai.com/sora) Ok, YouTubers will soon run out of Tendies, how does this mean NVIDIA will reach 2000$ you ask?


Well to see the connection you need to understand a bit of AI. There are 2 big models that currently exist: Transformers and Diffusion. The thing about transformers is that they operate on tokens. For language a bunch of letters together form a token. “ab” can be 1 token, “can” another token and so on. Basically they do not think in terms of single alphabets but actually think in terms of tokens. So OpenAI took 100 million Microsoft bucks, 1 billion+ NVIDIA GPU’s and created ChatGPT that started this AI bull run. 

Then came the question how to apply this technique to images. Naively each image generates far more tokens than a thousand word essay and so understanding an image seems extremely inefficient. Transformers will not work, smooth brained critics said. Then Sam Altman pulled the infinite money Microsoft glitch and OpenAI trained a massively large transformer on an ungodly number of GPUs and showed we could perfectly understand images with GPT-4. 

“Well ok maybe images work, but this will never work for videos, that would require an insane amount of compute”, smooth brained critics said. It turns out these critics just lacked imagination since Sam Altman proceeded to ask for 7 trillion dollars, more than the GDP of every country except US and China to throw more compute at AI. So when OpenAI says they will just brute force AI, throw trillions of compute at it and achieve AGI you better believe them. They have now come out with a transformer based Video Diffusion model. They never mentioned how big this model is, but it is probably bigger than GPT-4 . GPT-5 which is rumored to be able to understand and answer questions on video, is probably one order of magnitude bigger than GPT-4 and might cost 1 billion + to train. This means the market is still significantly underestimating the demand for NVIDIA chips and NVIDIAs price target should be 2000$ + in coming future.

TLDR; OpenAI’s foray into video using transformers shows there is far more compute they can use to generate even better AI’s. They will probably buy 10X the compute they already bought, from NVIDIA in the coming years in their quest to build AI. NVIDIA will skyrocket as a result.",6,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1arrumb/nvidia_will_cross_2000/,wallstreetbets

hclbrj,2020-06-20 12:13:34,I watch the press conference so you don't have to: Why Florida will not be shutting down,"There is an imbecile in another post on WSB who's struggles to put his diaper on in the morning who's attempting to give shit investment advice about how Florida will need to shut down. In an effort to justify his mom's hard fought public school education that he got he attempted to use big nickel words and graphs to show Arizona and Florida are in a doomsday pact with their residents and they're all going to need to lockdown again, or everyone is going to die. As the title suggests I watched the press conference yesterday by Gov Destanis so you don't have to, and am here to give the corrected information about what's going on in the nations best run state. 

First, one thing to understand about Florida is due to the constant hurricane issues and the large old people population they have had the most detailed data and fastest reporting data in the nation. The governor does not get up on stage with a crap PowerPoint every day and have no actual color to add to everything, instead they have very granular data which cuts through the polical nonsense.  All data referenced in this post will be in the imgur link at the end. 

Second all their elder care facilities are still on high alert and locked down. These have not reported and travel into and out of them are still very limited and carefully monitored.  All PPD is directed towards the elder care facilities, with hospitals getting the over run. 

Okay now onto the data. Yesterday Gov Destatis had a 1 hour+ press conference were he said where the state was at and where it was heading too. I doubt anyone from this sub watched it as it started about 10 minutes after apple decided to tank the market by announcing they were closing 8 stores. 
 
In this press conference he first discussed why the number of infected was increasing. (Chart 1) he showed that all the new cases are from people who are under the age of 40. Which for 99.6% of all people will not result in death but at worse will be a bad flu. Further he went on to state that nation wide the only 2 people have died under the age of 30 who didn't have huge co-morbidities before they got Covid. Basically if you are healthy today and catch it you will be fine. 

He breaks the new infection numbers down even further in chart 4 if you wanted to look at age split.

He backs his claim about younger people not being at risk with Chart 2 showing how the death rate is doing a nose dive. If they were actually at risk of death and were dying we would see it.  Additionally, he said they aren't going into hospitals either, as there are more available beds now in June than there were at any point between now and March 1st.

So this is a crap investment group so I should post on what this means for the market. Here's the brass tax, young people getting infected is a really good thing. The world has seen at least 6 major Covid related massive illnesses that they've attempted to develop a vaccine for. Do you want to know how many were successful? ZERO. There will not be a vaccine for covid-19 either as it mutates too fast. There is only one way out of this, herd immunity. The faster young heathy people get infected and become immune the faster we can attempt to go back to normal.  Any doctor on TV telling you anything else is lying to you. Also remember, our grandparents lived through a great depression 3 pandemics and 2 world wars and kept on trucking. We can make it through this.

Long story short, invest in America buy quality long positions and enjoy the ride. Also fuck idiots telling you the world is going to end.

1aqocz1,2024-02-14 14:37:31,I'm such an idiot. Saw how much Lyft drivers were getting screwed by Lyft. Meant to buy calls yesterday. Completely forgot to.,"And now shares are up 21.60% before the open. Would have doubled my money easy at least. I'm so fucking stupid. 

I've been reading posts on /r/Lyft, and Lyft is taking HUGE cuts from the drivers. It's not a viable business model long term. In the short term it was obvious they were going to make a lot more this quarter. Seems like they are really fucking over their drivers. Tons of examples where drivers are taking home less than 50% of what the customer is paying. Yes some of this has to do with taxes, but the Lyft drivers' cut has never been lower. Very bullish short term, and I was right, but an idiot who forgot to place the bet. 

Long term I think Uber/Lyft are kind of screwed. They are making money, but still very little, and these drivers are going to start quitting. It takes a while for drivers to realize how little they are making when you take into account wear/tear/depreciation. So long term these drivers, who lets be honest, are below average intelligence (if they are getting paid shit, yet still driving), will eventually figure out they are making jack shit and would be better off literally working at McDonalds. Uber/Lyft will have to raise rates on customers and make sure drivers are paid more. Then they'll be back to making almost no money at all. 

The only thing that will save these companies long term is self driving. Get rid of drivers and have fleets of self driving vehicles. Although if Tesla does solve FSD, do they really need a company like Uber/Lyft? Why not just do it themselves? Considering how much cash Tesla has, I could see them deciding to build self driving cars for their own self operated fleet. 

So where is Uber/Lyft long term? Maybe they only survive if there is a second option to Tesla FSD that works nationwide. But that seems to be the problem, is these companies like Waymo are only in certain cities, in certain conditions, etc, and are not going to be able to expand nationwide quickly. 

My prediction: Massive devaluation to Uber/Lyft, more Uber than Lyft wince it is worth 141B at a 76 P/E. Uber buying back $7b of shares right now. Morons.

Yes you.

I wasn't bothering anyone.  I simply woke up, checked my watchlist, and decided, after 3 MONTHS - three months - of tracking APHA, Wednesday was the day to buy. 

It always moved nicely.  Outpaced the sector, held firm when the sector took a hit. 

It didn't seem 'flashy', or 'gambling'.

It was just little ol me, who had been enjoying 100% gains over the past 12 months, cautiously, carefully, casually buying stocks I liked and accruing them. 

APHA was moving, and I astutely determined, ""People are waking up that this is the right play.  Time to pounce!""

Pounce I did. 

That night, I texted a buddy.  ""Hey, did you see know that APHA was being discussed over in WSB?  I hope this price jump isn't because of those guys...""

Next day, champagne!!!!! Up 40% in 24 hours????  Boy did I time that or did I time that?

lb3hb2,2021-02-02 19:02:06,Reverse gamma squeeze incoming,"Hello fellow bag holders

Here's my shitty DD, take it with a ton of salt cause I actually, truly have no idea what I'm talking about

&#x200B;

**Thesis:** 

This Friday and next Monday/Tues is going to experience the drop of all drops for GME due to expiring options being HEAVILY skewed towards puts

&#x200B;

Looking at the yahoo options chain ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&straddle=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&straddle=true)) and we end the week around the current price (say, $107):

&#x200B;

Total calls expiring ITM (strike price <= 105) : 16,337

Total puts expiring ITM (strike price >= 110) : 25,797

Net difference : 9460 more put contracts expire ITM, leading to an added **946,000 shares worth of selling pressure** 

On top of this selling pressure, similar to the gamma squeeze we saw on the way up with MMs buying shares as prices increase to cover the calls they wrote, **they will be selling shares as prices drop** to cover/hedge puts they wrote which are now ITM

&#x200B;

I have no idea if this makes sense

**Position:** GME 19Feb21 110 P

lv9ybg,2021-03-01 14:02:37,EVs are not the future! Please read this!,"Good morning my fellow fellows and non-fellows. I have discovered something that makes me feel uneasy and i feel that it needs to be shared.. something is BIG is going down, i have three things i would like to cover in this post, Rhodium; the uses of it, OPOC two stroke engines and the US Army and how the three are connected to a company that created this technology that just vanished off the face of the earth after proving combustion engines can be cleaner and more efficient then anything we can do with electric for the foreseeable future..

The Beginning of My Research : This started back in 2008 with a company called EcoMotors, i am and always have been obsessed with two-stroke engines as the power they can output is truly unmatched.. i discovered EcoMotors because they designed a two-stroke opposed piston opposed cylinder engine that would create a significant higher power output, using less fuel, including a lower count of moving parts and major cutbacks on overall weight, far surpassing the efficiency of EVs. Bill Gates was invested heavily in this company... then China got involved, a massive deal to produce 150'000 units of this engine was struck in China and then suddenly.. it all goes dark, no more news, no explanation.. the company shuts down, the production plant is deemed ""defunct"" and all of the information and patents owned by the company were privately purchased and essentially removed from the public eye.

Where it Gets Weird; Rhodium : As an investor i'm actively looking for the ""next big thing"" as we all are and i have a soft spot for precious metals ( they're just so shiny ) through countless hours of sifting through the garbage pile that we call the internet i discovered a PGM ( platinum group metal ) called Rhodium and this little shiny turd is a golden boy in the world of precious metal right now, it has rocketed from roughly $2'200/oz to over $22'000/oz from 2018 - 2021 with no signs of stopping anytime soon, the primary use ( literally over 80% of all mined rhodium ) is in catalytic converters used on internal combustion engines, the whole market is pushing EVs and yet Rhodium is skyrocketing in value.. it makes no sense if the world is going electric right? Very very odd.. 

THE PLOT THICKENS! : So now knowing that there is a type of combustion engine in play that crushes the efficiency of anything electric and that it's been around for years.. on top of that a catalyst metal that would be directly used with engines of this variety is rocketing in value behind the scenes while EV has the spotlight.. it makes you wonder.. why isn't it being used in everyday transportation? Because it's so damn good the military wanted it first, Achates Power landed a contract with the US Army in the end of 2020 to produce high efficiency opoc engines for all of the vehicles in the US Army throughout 2021. So ask yourself this.. if EV is the future, why is the most power military force in the world investing in the development of high efficiency internal combustion two-stroke opocs, we are being lied to above EVs and have been for years. Please spread this information, this truly is a very viable alternative to EVs as it wouldn't require restructuring our society to accommodate battery powered retard-mobiles. 

I strongly believe this information is being suppressed, it took me countless hours to uncover this and it's not a conspiracy, all of this is happening and i personally care deeply about the future of this planet ( i'm sure we all do ) people need to know about so please, share. I'll link sources below.

You’re unjustified hate on AMC is extremely bullish for AMC. You just proved it last week. The continued hate over the weekend is only more bullish for AMC.

Been always scared of it. (Not that I have been conservative with my spy 0DTE trades, that's a topic for a different conversation) 

I was looking at the chart since the craze started last year and took a quick look and feels like it has been in a wedge or whatever the heck the chart retards call it. Obviously, I did not know which of the bottom line I should have gone with, but irrespective of which one I use feels like it broke that trend which supposedly means it would go lower.   


Butt, my question is this not what folks are seeing? Where do we think GME is headed from here and why? Feels like it is headed back to at least 50s or 60s.

jlslnd,2020-10-31 23:41:54,Election Results - Trump will win. Calls on GEO or CXW,"Gents, I am not here to discuss policies or who would be a better president, but here me out. Trump is gonna win. Fuck the polls, fuck survey data, fuck what people are saying. Just put it on mute because it’s useless. Here are my findings:

So I’ve been watching these rallies on both sides at the toss-up states and yes, it’s very much one-sided. 

1. Trump has so many more people showing up to rallies and it seems like he has the physical numbers advantage compared to Biden. Well Biden supporters might be scared of COVID and might be watching it from their homes?

2. Well, that’s exactly what I thought and did some investigation. But, it seems that there are more people tuned into Trump’s live broadcast than Biden’s. Well, most of the people might be on Trump’s livestream to hate on him. While this may be true,

3. The like-to-dislike ratio for Trump’s live stream was 550-190 vs Biden’s live stream 100-500. Well, it might be due to Media Broadcasting Bias?

4. Sure, except they’re both being broadcasted via Yahoo Finance - least biased News channel. Then, maybe Youtube is home to more right-wing individuals? Google tells me that Youtube has more left-leaning individuals than right-leaning individuals. To better understand statistics, I’ve decided to peruse CNN and FOX's Youtube Channels.

5. The haters of CNN are gigantic. Much more in comparison to FOX hates. Check out CNN's recent videos and look at the like-dislike ratio. It’s incomparable to FOX’s.

6. Not only CNN though. Check out CTV, CBS, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, etc. (which are all left-wing) and check out their like-dislike ratio. It’s insurmountable. 

The silent majority is real - and it’s going to be another 4 more years for Trump whether you like it or not.

xnf977,2022-09-25 06:09:33,NFTs are the Pyramid and Ponzi Schemes of Our Generation,"I know the ""no cryptocurrency"" rule but NFTs are only bought with cryptocurrency, but they, by themselves, are not cryptocurrency, so I'm hoping to avoid the mods deleting this post, but I can see why they would (I tried to post on r/CryptoCurrency but I'm simply too young and unwise as a Redditor).

&#x200B;

A pro-NFT argument I always see is, ""It's just like buying valuable paintings,"" I have never understood how anyone can make this argument and present it as being anything but ridiculous.

A real painting can easily be verified. Let's say you bought the Mona Lisa, which is worth almost $900 million. You would have the exact canvas that Leonardo da Vinci used and the exact brush strokes he made. If I were to take a photo of the painting and print it out, I would not have that canvas nor the brush strokes. Even if I could perfectly draw the Mona Lisa, it would not be verified by anyone as genuine because it does not have the exact features of the canvas and brush strokes. We do not yet have the technology to perfectly clone the centuries of aging and all the small imperfections that come with it.

On the other hand, NFTs are unverifiable. If I were to take a screenshot or click, ""Save image,"" I would have the exact same pixels, the exact same picture, and the exact same NFT. There are no special pixels that only you have. I have everything that you have in the exact same way that you have it. And unless I explicitly say that I ""stole"" it, you have no way of proving that the NFT is yours and not 100% mine, there is no proof of purchase, no receipt, no logs of money exchanged, nothing.

Credit/debit cards and cash can be tracked, but cryptocurrency cannot. The people selling NFTs can easily give you a copy of an NFT they already have, and you cannot do anything about it. There are no receipts, everything is the seller's word against yours.

NFTs have become the Pyramid and Ponzi schemes of this generation. They are worthless pixels paraded around as valuable pieces of art to sucker people into buying them, the people who fall for the scheme end up regretting it and having to sell it to make the money back, so they sucker someone else into paying for it and then they sucker someone else into buying it, creating a cycle of scams started by the original maker and seller of the NFT. It is a game of online hot potato where you toss the NFT around until someone is absolutely unable to sell it.",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xnf977/nfts_are_the_pyramid_and_ponzi_schemes_of_our/,wallstreetbets

18osfzz,2023-12-22 23:51:55,Fed pivot canceled by Houthis,"Not sure what the politics policy is on wsb but I promise this is important to stonks.

With the war in Gaza going on, the Houthi’s have been launching missiles in the Red Sea to stop ships from going through the Mediterranean. This has caused ships to have to go all the way around Africa to get to their destinations.

With that, freight costs are expected to hit $10,000 when they’re usually around $2000. That’s a 5x difference. One of the biggest reasons for inflation was the supply chain issue. If you compare shipping rates and CPI, you’ll see they follow closely. If shipping costs go up, so does inflation.

Now, it’s not quite up to the $20,000 that it cost during COVID, but if the Houthis continue to launch missiles at ships and prolong this conflict, it could continue to keep inflation high. Ultimately the federal reserve might be forced to keep rates higher or even raise them again if inflation starts to creep upwards due to shipping costs. The federal funds futures market still seems too optimistic and hasn’t priced this in.

On the other hand, it’s possible the supply chain disruption won’t last long if the military can intercept Houthis missiles. What do you regards think?

x2sbxc,2022-08-31 23:43:04,Buy shares and become a bbb(y)agholder.,"What’s up apeists and regards. Apes are regarded but not in the positive way. Apes are actually regarded.

Allow me a moment to explain…

Do you actually like BBBY (the retail store) or any of their other brands?

My mom used to take me there as a kid and I remember she’d walk out with 7-10 items $450 later like clockwork.

What do they sell, idk 🤷‍♂️ Random ass sharper image shit and pillows or something?

My wife sometimes takes me to buy buy baby and we always walk out with like a $650 car seat or some shit. It’s absolutely regarded.

I hate their stores, they’re boring as fuck and I usually want to slit my wrists after walking around in their aimlessly for 3 hours while my wife buys soda streams or some bullshit.

How does this relate to GME, AMC, etc….

I also hate GameStop. Talk about overpriced, customer fucking bullshit. When MW2 came out I sold my PS2 and my entire collection of games, all of my guitar hero controllers, and still owed them like $20 just to get my copy. They likely turned around and made at least a couple hundred on all of my stuff. Why do I like this company? I don’t…. Fuck them.

Remember AMC ??? Oh yeah, I remember being 16 and spending $80 to take my girlfriend to the movie, and get snacks. I hate AMC. 

Would I ever own shares of these companies? Absolutely not. The fact that these businesses still exist is insane. The internet solves all of the problems that these companies set out to address when they were first established. They’re absolute horseshit.

But that has nothing to do with the fact that people have traded and made a fuck ton of money on options contracts that use these companies shares as the underlying.

You get inherent leverage with OTM options contracts, and can put up much lower amounts of capital to achieve the same results that you would have if you held the correlated position in shares alone. If you’re buying long options, you’ll also never end up as a shareholder of a dogshit company (unless you want to be). 

Most options contracts expire worthless so you’re also (most importantly) not giving the board of directors free money by way of share price increase that they can turn around and dilute you with. 

Dilution is a good thing if you actually believe in the company because they’re effectively raising cash that they can use for development. If you’re giving a company that sucks a ton of money, they’re just going to turn around a give their entire board raises for “doing a great job” for the quarter. 

Philosophically apes seem to be preaching a dystopian reality in which they’re all standing together and getting rich together and fucking over hedge funds but in reality the only people getting fucked over are the retail investors. Hedge funds are hedged (duh) if they have a manager that’s not artistic and can take on the losses (if any). Market makers make money on the trading volume, the company’s board gets paid, long term holders can finally sell their garbage shares, and options traders make and lose money like usual.

STOP BUYING SHARES of COMPANIES YOU DONT BELIEVE in. STOP EXERCISING SHARES that are OTM. 

If you do, it’s nobodies fault but your own. Stop bitching and putting more regulatory scrutiny on our backs. You are burning money. This is a CASINO, not an investment club. 

Regulators either don’t give a fuck,or don’t get this game. Any regulation “to protect us” literally just makes it harder for little guys to have any shot at life changing money. 

PSA… I am not a financial advisor. Keep being an ape if you want.

EDIT:

This is not FUD. I have and do trade options on $bbby $GME $AMC. 

Remember when we used to trade Lumber Liquidators and it wasn’t a cult?

TL;DR

Do your own research and don’t necessarily invest with the hive mind…. 

Simple DD

EDIT: 

For all of you conspiracy theorist hardos. Here’s a fun trivia fact:

By volume the majority of Robinhood’s option orders were not routed to Citadel up to and during the $GME saga. They were routed to [Wolverine](https://www.wolve.com/), but I haven’t seen a single post of outrage related to this market maker? They also have a [hedge fund](https://www.wolvefunds.com/).

v7afob,2022-06-07 23:01:38,Reddit will be one of the BEST IPO’s you will ever buy.,"**THE FUTURE OF REDDIT**

Look at you. You’re a male and probably single. You use [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) for your social interactions because you don’t go anywhere on the weekends and wait for market open to gamble your life savings away since you have no wife or even kids to care for. 

So now enter Reddit in 2022. How is Reddit going to compete with the metaverse and keep your cucked eyeballs on here instead of VR? Now while we all may think the metaverse and VR is stupid, it’s where our worlds heading. 

So how does Reddit fit in to the [metaverse?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/06/07/virtual-reality-check-when-will-the-metaverse-vision-become-a-reality/amp/) Imagine Reddit right now. You open it, and see a series of threads or questions on a server. You read and reply. 

Now imagine being in a VR Reddit open world. There will be a central lobby where everyone starts out. Ever play COD WW2? Similar to that type of [lobby](https://youtu.be/JrU-aT5TNBM) where everyone chills until they go into a certain game. You essentially choose a “sub” to go into and you can talk to people in real time about the thread. So let’s say someone starts a conversation on wsb about how $KO is a buy, you’d basically be in a huge room with everyone else in the thread talking about it in real time. Reddit will eventually serve as the ultimate social server in the metaverse. The Redditverse! You’ll also be able to watch past threads and talk to them in “real time” because it’s all VR. 

The sad reality of this is if you think escapism is bad now? Oh boy, wait until everyone just meets people on the Redditverse and they never have any friends in real life. Wait until your wife finds her boyfriend in the Redditverse and he’s jacked online but some balding 40 year old virgin cuck in real life.

**THE MARKET**

My guess is Reddit will IPO sometime this year. It may go down like $HOOD at first. This will be the best time to yolo. Now, my guess is Reddit will be bought out by Meta. Now most people will be confused by this, but Facebook knows it will be making the Redditverse. More people like Reddit than Facebook, so it’s perfect.

wwxfcs,2022-08-24 22:55:16,Bed Bath & Beyond's Challenges Linger After Loan Deal,"[Link to WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bed-bath-beyonds-challenges-linger-after-loan-deal-11661378955)

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. selected asset manager Sixth Street Partners to supply new financing, according to people familiar with the matter, as doubts remain among vendors and some investors about the company’s turnaround prospects.

Sixth Street is in exclusive talks with Bed Bath & Beyond and is nearing final terms for a loan of close to $400 million to shore up the troubled retailer’s liquidity, according to people familiar with the matter. Negotiations to finalize the loan documents are ongoing, one of the people said.

The company told prospective lenders it had selected a proposal for an asset-based loan, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday citing people familiar with the matter. Bed Bath & Beyond stock climbed as much as 30% on Wednesday, closing up 18% at $10.36.

A loan deal would help refill the company’s coffers and give confidence to vendors that Bed Bath & Beyond can pay its bills. The business has sought to stretch payments to some vendors, which have been pulling credit to the company in recent weeks amid mounting doubts that it could pay them back and a shortage of credit insurance, according to people familiar with the matter.

At least one firm that finances suppliers has stopped providing credit on shipments to Bed Bath & Beyond, the Journal has reported.

The loan is structured as a first-in-last-out facility, meaning it is backed by collateral but will only be paid out after other secured debt in the event of bankruptcy, the people said.

Sixth Street Partners manages $60 billion in assets, and has a retail lending practice that has made loans to retailers such as J.C. Penney Co. and DSW Inc.

The loan is part of a broader plan by the company to shore up its finances. Bed Bath & Beyond indicated earlier this month that it is in talks with lenders and its professional advisers to strengthen its balance sheet and would provide a comprehensive update later in August.

But given its high cash burn in the second quarter, the company will likely need to secure more support from investors to give it runway to execute its restructuring plan.

“The loan would provide a couple more quarters of time to show improvement operationally and appease vendors,” said Seth Basham, analyst at Wedbush Securities. “While we’re skeptical of their ability to generate cash in the short term, if they can show that they can improve their margins and free cash flow through the holidays, that could be a path to regain investor confidence.”

Traditional debt markets may not be a viable route for the retailer to raise new capital. Bed Bath & Beyond’s bonds are trading at deeply distressed levels, indicating that any new debt issued by the company may be prohibitively costly with effective yields above 25%.

The Union, N.J., retailer does have a path to issue millions of new shares, potentially helping the company secure an additional lifeline. Bed Bath & Beyond hasn’t indicated yet whether it expects to issue new shares.

“We’re surprised that the company didn’t try to issue shares,” said Bradley Thomas, analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. “It would have been silly not to at least consider it given where the stock was trading.”

The company has been closing stores, reducing corporate overhead and renegotiating contracts with vendors as it looks to cut costs, but its cash burn has deepened in recent months as sales have fallen. Unsecured bonds backed by the company trade between 15 and 30 cents on the dollar, a sign that investors doubt they’ll be paid back in full.

The receipt of a loan may abate some of those concerns. Bond traders at Goldman Sachs Group quoted Bed Bath & Beyond’s bonds between five and 10 points higher Wednesday, people familiar with the matter said.

Bed Bath & Beyond’s shares have been on a roller-coaster ride, more than quadrupling this month through Wednesday as investors bet the retailer could become the next distressed company to harness stock-market exuberance to raise funds from enthusiastic shareholders. The stock dropped after activist investor Ryan Cohen sold all of his stake, but it is still up 80% this month.",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wwxfcs/bed_bath_beyonds_challenges_linger_after_loan_deal/,wallstreetbets

lhmw52,2021-02-11 15:22:10,GME was a game. Weed is an artificially inflated bubble. There is a much better opportunity to make money and help society at the same time.,"I am an economist and a psychologist, I've been on reddit forever, and I've always been a market index etf/hold type of investor (optimal balance of risk/reward) so I had no use for subreddits like r/wallstreetbets in the past.

With all the noise bubbling up about GME, I was curious to see what's up.   My take on what's going on:

GME:  Let's get real.  It's a doomed brick and mortar game company.  Boosting it was fun, but it's ultimately artificial and we all know we're unlikely to hand more and more of our personal dollars over to Gamestop in the coming years even if they come up with some kind of competent online strategy (it's laughable we're still waiting on that this late in the game).  Sorry if you're holding the bag, but there's no point.  The company doesn't have legs.

Weed: This is a legitimate industry with very predictable, steady long term growth as more markets come online with easing laws and regs.   It's not going to grow much more in existing markets.  Weed is just weed.   You can only consume so much, and it's easy to get sick of it.   It has some limited medical uses, but it's not about to surprise us.   IOW, the long term growth potential is all priced in.   Boosting it was fun, but ultimately pointless, WSB has generated another bubble.  Don't get caught holding the bag here either.

Psychedelics:   Ok this is a real opportunity.   The research on psychedelics is astounding.  It's effective in novel ways, providing profound relief from otherwise intractable conditions like major depressive disorder, and used in conjuction with therapy, is effective for helping people cope with PTSD, anxiety, and potentially many other emotional issues.   Unlike other medicines used to treat these conditions, it appears possible to deliver psychelic therapies with very minimal side effects.   As a psychologist, I am incredibly hopeful about the potential benefits it can bring with proper research and social acceptance.  As an economist, I see a world changing development that doesn't just boost the economy, but the well being of people as a whole.  Investing in pyschedics will actually help usher them into the mainstream, opening up more research opportunities and pushing back on the long-standing conservative stranglehold preventing us from discovering more about the potential for these drugs.  

In other words, it's good for a short term investment, it's great for long term investment, and it's a much more prosocial investment than say, tryiing to ""stick it to the big guys.""  I recommend the ETF PSYK, and the company MMEDF Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc.   Both are great entry points.

s6h41e,2022-01-17 22:38:10,"The ""WSB Friendly"" Ape DD mentality DD pt. 2 (The bears are coming)","**(DISCLAIMER: I've had trouble posting this all day so Im leaving out the links here, if you would like to see the links, go to my page for the unedited version).**

Hey everyone, oickles here! You may have known me for my Ape mentality DD post a while back. I wanted to give you a quick update on what's been going on since I've written that post and even further analysis on why I think Apes are fukt.


#The Breaking Point


Apes have been reaching breaking points as their beloved stock crumbles before their very eyes. One notable instance is going on with the AMC community where, their [stock-tubers are getting suicidal DMs from apes who threw in entire life savings into the stock hoping for a Moass.(I had to remove the link due to the mod removing it)
  This isn't a game, people are really reaching their breaking point with meme stocks, what you may see in the next 2 weeks may be huge selloffs. People are throwing everything they have to keep the stock propped up [see here](https://imgur.com/gallery/6PUWI9w).


This concludes that apes and retail in general is running out of ammo. The free money from the stimulus has ran out, life savings, any free money that was for benefits even has ran out and they are truly fukt. Apes have cornered themselves in a fortress of shit and are flinging it also at each other while convincing themselves that RC or DFV will come from the heavens and save them. The stocks cannot keep up it's inflated price and the stock will continue to tumble; it's inevitable and a reality for most apes as they watch their life savings go down the drain.


#Gamestop


Gamecock has been the front-runner for most stock investors, its wild volatile swings have been astounding for swing traders. Recently SS had deleted a user's post for making 6 Million dollars from swing trading the stock stating; ""They didnt want other users to follow his example"". Yeah they want the apes to keep bagholding because that's how you make money? You've been brainwashed into thinking that buying a stock makes you money instead of swing trading it. I'd rather pay 45% taxes on 3 million instead of 30% on 20k. I'm just saying..


Gamestop as a company is burning cash with no potential room for growth, revenue and a future. [The stock is essentially burning cash from 1.7Bill to 1.5B and dropping](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-gme/gamestop/news/gamestop-nysegme-has-debt-but-no-earnings-should-you-worry-1). The apes would have you believe that the price doesnt matter, the earnings doesnt matter, nothing matters except the DD and this is how you form a cult. You've been gaslighted into losing your money, your hard earned investments and hopes and dreams over a stock that will probably never return to the ATH you sold them for. 


Gamestop doesnt fit in the NFT marketplace and here's why that bullshit pitch is nothing less than copium. Apes with their short termed memory proposed the NFT dividend to expose naked shorting and start the Moass as to what they believe ""we own the float multiple times and a dividend to count each stock would expose the overshorting of the stock"". This fell apart when there was no dividend announced and the Cult leaders had to come up with another tangible lie to keep the Ape's invested. All of a sudden GME is a ""Fundamentals play"" when all before ""Fundamentals don't matter"", ""it's a squeeze play"". I personally asked Gamers how they felt about NFTs and they responded VERY NEGATIVELY 

Gamestop investors are trying so hard to preach and push NFTs when:

1. NOONE WANTS IT, OUTSIDE OF THE SHITFLINGING APES.

2. NO Developer who would issue an NFT, would ever lose potential profits to a brick and mortar store when they could sell it directly out of their own stores. 

The reason why GME is failing and so hated amoung developers is because, they resell used games and do not pay the companies of the games they resell. [Most of, if not all of the profits goes towards GME and this causes alot of lost revenue.](https://youtu.be/703cX_edBlk). You coukd say that game skins from Call of Duty are NFTs, but noone is going to GameStop to buy COD skins. You can buy the skins straight from Sony store, then buy Cod points and get the skin.


Everything is becoming mainstream, NFTs doesn't fit GameStop's narrative and if anything accelerated it's death. You can buy a ps5 from Sony and Amazon or UPS will deliver it, noone needs Gamestop anymore and it's earnings report proves it. Losing 500 Million dollars while increasing in 300 Mill in inventory is not bullish. It means less people are buying and they cannot sell the products they have to compensate. 

#FUD, Shills, Bears?

Anything negative about gamestop gets downvoted and noted as ""Paid Shill, Bot and FUD"", so here's what I'm going to do for the apes. Im going to list out some cult signs and debunk some theories about this ""paid shills"".

Signs of a cult:

1. The leader is the ultimate authority (DFV, AA, RC, DD grifters)


 ""If you’re not allowed to criticize your leader, even if the criticism is true, you’re probably in a cult.
Cults begin with a charismatic leader who claims some supreme knowledge. They may call themselves a prophet, messiah, messenger, or an enlightened teacher. They can also be CEOs, military officials, politicians, and self-help gurus.""

2. The group suppresses skepticism (FUD, Shill, Bot)


 If you’re only allowed to study your organization through approved sources, you’re probably in a cult.
Cults view critical thinking as an infectious disease and every effort is made to suppress it. Doubting members are encouraged to isolate themselves from outside influences and focus solely on the doctrine of the cult.


3. The group delegitimizes former members (If you leave, you're a paperhanded bitch)

If you can’t think of a legitimate reason for leaving your group, you’re probably in a cult.
Because the cult considers itself the ultimate authority on truth, it can’t imagine anybody leaving it with their integrity intact. Thus, it has to perpetuate a false narrative that former members were deceived, proud, immoral, or lazy.

4.The group is paranoid about the outside world (Everyone is in on it. Amazon, SEC, DTCC, Citadel, CIA, FBI)

If your group insists the end of the world is near, you’re probably in a cult.
Cults position themselves as the sole refuge from an evil outside world that is intent on their destruction. Cults thrive on conspiracy theories, catastrophic thinking, and persecution complexes.


5.The group relies on shame cycles (As shown in one of my pictures, the apes need support because noone believes them)

If you need your group in order to feel worthy, loved, or sufficient, you’re probably in a cult.
Cult leaders trap members in shame cycles by imposing abnormally strict codes of conduct (usually prescriptions about diet, appearance, sex, relationships, media), guilting members for their shortcomings, and then positioning themselves as the unique remedy to the feelings of guilt which they themselves created

#Earnings and how to gauge them

Gamestop Q4 earnings are good however; we can compare them by a year by year analysis to see what direction the business is headed in: [Here](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/revenue)

Even with the Ape and stock boost, Gamestop is still a failing company that DFV fairly valued at 20-40 dollars. He never cited a Moass and this is what caused the downfall of most apes.

It's honestly a shame to see this, you guys could've been a market terror causing short squeezes all over and getting rich. You instead got yourselves and everyone else involved with your Moass propaganda and Everyone can see through your shit. (link removed)

That being said, the stock will continue to tumble even with the small rips it will have. Call it a bear flag if you must, but this stock is going to 20 fast and once Apes wake up and realize they have been duped, I could honestly see [terrorist acts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s4pswk/at_least_they_get_nfts/) being attempted on DD writers and RC for not delivering the promised Moass.

Apes, get out and get some help, reconnect with your loved ones and admit you have a issue. You can rebuild what you've lost, do not wait until it's all gone to try because this will happen [to you](https://www.joshuakennon.com/gt-advanced-technologies-bankruptcy/)

Edit: You can see users like Bigstonkguy that are making a killing from shorting. Shorts are not fucked, Apes are.

I'm doing this so some of you change your behavior and because the sub matters to me.

Disclaimer: I have puts on $GME, sold my $80s and $100s on the rip down yesterday, and twice had shares/calls, and will perhaps have shares and calls again if it ever goes back down a long ways because I'm here to make money.

**My background:** Been trading this sub's ideas since 2016 silently, my prop firm friends turned me onto this place (they do listen/watch this sub). I used to post DD for the week from my personal notebook each week back in 2019, I had thousands of people waiting each Sunday for those DD posts. Someone contacted my wife/tried to doxx me on the street, it freaked me out, I deleted the old account (SoRefreshing). I'm not a shill, or a bear, or any of that shit. I work for myself and trade at home now. I'll start my DD up again when the GME shit dies down, I can't do the posts because: I would instantly get labeled a shill or distraction or a hedgie or some stupid other fucking shit which is the reason for this post.

**In short:** The people here that have been around pre-GME or especially pre 2019 probably share the same sentiment that they're sick of $GME. It's not because of the quality/length of time this has been a phenomenon here, or even the trade itself, we love when stocks do what it is doing because many of us play both sides and make money in both directions, but we hate it **because of the absolutely cultish and ridiculous behavior of some of the people trading it.**

Personally, I think it should be an instantly temp-bannable offense to do some of the shit in this thread so that we can start cleaning up the ridiculous cultish behavior but whatever, you apes do you.

&#x200B;

# The Right Reasons To Be In $GME:

1. **You like the turnaround story, and are willing to hold years to see it come to fruition.** This would be considered an investment, something almost nobody around here has experience with.
2. **You are simply gambling to gamble, and like the stock.** Sure, buy it up, you're going to have some juicy loss porn if you never sell (and if you're retarded enough to not sell at $500+ and again at $300+ honestly you deserve it)
3. **You like to not be left out.** I get it, everybody is buying it, so you bought some. Whatever, we've all done it. This is a stupid reason but exponentially better than the shit the new normies spread around the daily Financial Jonestown thread (stolen from another WSBer, credit for the person that claims it idk who it was)

&#x200B;

# The Wrong Reasons To Be in GME:

1. **You think a squeeze is coming to $10,000.** It isn't. People should literally get instabanned for saying this shit because there are people stupid enough to believe it. Granted, that's their bad for being so stupid, but this won't happen (I expand on that below) mostly because the system CANNOT let it happen. You're playing a rigged game, get over it.
2. **You think you're bankrupting hedge funds.** You're not. They'll get a bailout if you do, or another one of their buddies will step in and cannibalize them. Stop being silly.
3. **You have any personal vendetta or motive.** It's stupid to trade on emotions. Do it if you want, keep telling people you're holding but stop attacking people that sell or have a contrarian idea. Believe it or not: **Not selling at $300+ or $250 and having it crash back down to $40 with the heavy ass bags you have isn't badass, it's ridiculous. We're here to make money.** Even if you believe the turnaround -- it's stupid. I love some of my holdings but if they gain a pile in a short time, I take some profit off the table because I want to be a boyfriend and not a cuck some day.
4. **If you think every drop is a ""short ladder"" or ""short attack"".** Some people just sell their shares. Some people need the money and they shouldn't be investing in $GME if so but, that's life.

&#x200B;

Ranting and explanations of some of the points:

&#x200B;

1. **There's no massive squeeze coming, ever. The best you can hope for is to crush individual shorts into adding volume when they buy back,** but the hedge funds aren't the ones you're beating up on. Citadel will win the war in the end because they can stay liquid longer than all of the holdings in $GME combined. **More importantly, if they're still in, they're hedged, you can guarantee it. Gabe almost got the fund torched,** but he got a bailout from his buddies. Listen, they won't let it happen, it WILL NOT HAPPEN. If you are playing this for a squeeze, then you are in it for the WRONG REASONS. If the first run up to $500+ didn't get shorts out, then they re-shorted at $500 and covered lower. You can be guaranteed shorts that didn't are operational shorts (to hedge put contracts, hedge fund, **hedge**) and play into the price almost not at all. In the impending run up to $300+ recently, the shorts likely cycled again, people covering, and re-shorting. This will lead to compoundingly low highs as people are more likely to cover to not get caught under a squeeze. Each time it happens, it will gain less momentum, what you're seeing is weeks of consolidation into a price range driven by algos and the apes here with money. **$100,000 or even $1,500 a share** from a squeeze is a **COMPLETE meme.** If it hits those price levels, it's for sure massive whales playing games against each other, not because you're bankrupting hedge funds. To double from $500 to $1,000 takes another DOUBLE of the market cap. Today, at around $185 the cap sits at $13B give or take. To double to $370 would require $13B of inflows. Each time it goes up, it exponentially gets harder for retail to have impact on the price but also for it to continue going up. Institutions - because of their fiduciary responsibility - aren't buying this to put in client portfolios. More importantly, the higher it goes up, the more likely a fund has to rebalance the fund's holdings (IE: liquidate literally millions of shares) since one stock would then provide too much risk and they have a responsibility to take profits. The entire system is designed to work against squeezes like the VW one (which is awesome to talk about, but a completely different time, and different situation than we face now.) It's just not happening.
2. **The second time it ran from $40 up to $100+ was not retail volume.** This easily could have been a massive short from $500+ closing it out and riding up call contracts during their closeout. It could have just been a complete bait. There's a reason it floated around back at $40 when the algos turned off. Some days when you watch the price action the volume is dead, the price isn't jumping up and down rapidly, this is a sign there's less machines trading it. HFT firms likely jumped back on board when it got super volatile because that's when they make the most money, by scalping the spread. You could literally just be at the mercy of machines fighting each other right now, this could be some retail volume but the slow bleed from $330 to $180 then the crash after earnings leads me to believe it's far less retail and more algos playing the momentum. Sure, some of you are buying shares, but I think you are really over-estimating the amount of shares people have and the impact we have on this.
3. **There is no fucking movement.** This is the biggest one I think. You aren't in this together with anyone and you should stop with the ""hold HOLD!"" shit to other people. You're in this alone, either you're in it to make money, or you're in it for the wrong reasons. You're not putting a real dent into hedge funds, stop being fucking ignorant if you aren't doing it just for the dank memes. I know a guy that killed himself over money in the market, someone telling him to ""HOLD"" on a play, and he lost it all. Tell people you're holding, tell people you think it's stupid to sell, but knock off the shit with massively downvoting people that sell or telling people that sold to fuck off, etc. This is what annoys people from this sub that built the culture the most. Chances are 80% of the people playing this are doing so with money they can't afford to lose - if they choose to share their loss porn then they deserve the needle and should be prepared to accept it, if not, then you're in this ALONE.
4. **There's no fucking shills.** Not everyone that is contrarian to your confirmation bias is a shill. CNBC isn't in cahoots to spread FUD, there is a lot of veterans on Wall Street that have seen exactly what is going on before, multiple times. Just because they say the valuation is ridiculous doesn't mean they're missing anything. Real statistics showing 20% short interest instead of 100%+ aren't shills, they're just telling you the truth. It already squeezed. We just know this is a fucking pump and dump of gigantic proportions. It may not be today, it may not be tomorrow, but this mother fucker is coming piling back down (for a second time) and some of you are going to hold some very, very heavy bags. There's no way around it.
5. **You guys are just playing a big game of chicken with each other.** If you're willing to do that, fine, but this is just a $13B pump and dump. Some unnamed institution may be buying up shares to push the price up, especially today, since they have a vested interest in the at the market offering sale in order to raise capital for GameStop and generate revenue for themselves. I won't name the name because you can go hunt it down if you want to know.
6. **The turnaround is priced in.** Believe it or not, when a company goes from a <$1B market cap to $13B if it holds these price levels, the turnaround is completely priced in an you could buy leap puts and it's printing money, who knows what amount, but it's printing money. Also: turnarounds like the one Cohen is executing take YEARS, not weeks, not months. You won't see appreciable movement in the numbers (which matter, whether you believe it or not) for years. Plus they're massively restructuring, and the chance GameStop still fails is a lot higher than people here give credit to. They need to drastically shift their business, and I believe they will, but it's not even 50/50. It's probably 70/30 that the business still fails completely, regardless how long you HODL your stock.

Yeah that's all I have. I'm just tired of the cultish shit coming from $GME people. A lot of us who say that shit or tease you in the $GME daily thread are just doing so because we hate the way this sub is transforming into some ridiculous GME sized version of the ""LET ME INNN"" meme.

At some point, it's just too much. I know others have hit their point, and I hit mine, so I made this post. Stop giving advice or doing DD posts if you have no fucking clue because you're not doing yourself a favor just by getting upvotes for confirmation bias. I just saw a guy point at declining volume on a DD post as proof that people are shorting downticks. Like what, the, fuck.

Just because you've been here a couple months and lost/made 100k doesn't make you a market expert. You're just a brainless mush clicking buttons like most people here.

I have puts right now. Yeah, I think it's gonna crash, no they don't expire this week, or next, or the one after, so I have plenty of time to wait. I'm already so far green and others are from playing both sides of this trade up and down there is no motive in this post as far as wanting you to sell for my puts, that doesn't matter to me in the scheme of things.

It's that I really used to love this place, and now it's fucking mind numbingly difficult to put up with it for more than a few minutes until I come across a post like: ""Why is it going down"" or ""Should I sell"" or ""$GME BABY FUCK EVEYONE ELSE SHILL SHILL SHILL"".

 BEAR THESIS on   LORDSTOWN MOTORS (4RIDE)

1) Lordstown Motors ability to continue as a company is a going concern. The possibility they may not get the additional funding required to ramp up the production phase of their operations. Worst case scenario: They could go bankrupt and this will result in hundreds of families in Lordstown, Ohio without work. However, the moment they say, “funding secured”, this stock will triple.

2) Lordstown Motors future capital requirements; their ability to execute their business plan, and the risks related to the rollout of their business and the timing of expected release date for the Endurance. The Endurance is their all-electric full-size pick-up truck, the failure of this vehicle to launch successfully by the end of this year will be severely detrimental to the success of the company. **Lordstown Motors must release the Endurance this year.**

3) Lordstown Motors ability to obtain binding purchase orders and build customer relationships, including uncertainties as to whether and to what degree we are able to convert previously-reported nonbinding pre-orders and other indications of interest in their vehicle into binding orders and ultimately sales. While companies like Ford and GM have a track record of succeeding in the fleet industry, Lordstown Motors is a new upcomer, and thus, this unknown variable causes a high degree of uncertainty.

4) Competition in the EV industry, from established veterans such as Ford, GM, and newcomers such as Rivian, Lucid, and others can’t be underestimated and understated. This is a serious threat to Lordstown Motors that cannot be ignored. Again, **Lordstown Motors must release the Endurance this year to get first mover advantage.**

· Niche category. They are selling to FLEETS. The automotive space is big enough for everyone, and with their interests focused on the fleet industry, and with first mover advantage, they could hit the ground running and become profitable sooner than expected.

· Billion’s worth of assets (3rd largest automotive facility in the US, vertically integrated factory with the 2nd biggest battery assembly and propulsion center being built out)

· No debt: looking to get $200m ATVM loan from the Dept of Energy by end of June and/or a strategic investor (GM, Camping World come to mind)

· Lordstown Week: huge catalyst 6/21-6/25 and retail investors will get a live glimpse at the facility and a test drive of the Endurance truck on Friday 6/25. 

· During Lordstown Week, they will be revealing the Lordstown “family of vehicles” - meaning likely Endurance, Electric RV, and another electric van. The ERV is being built in conjunction with Camping World.

lelwdj,2021-02-07 12:52:29,Why IRBT might be the next big short squeeze,"Let me interrupt the GME gain porn for a second. I know. GME was (and maybe still is) the opportunity of a lifetime. Most of you think it will never happen again. But I am not so sure about that. In the last weeks it became painfully obvious, that hedgefunds have manipulated the market for decades. They have artificially deflated the prices of some companies by excessively shorting their stocks. That left them vulnerable. And we have just started to expose their weakness. While GME was a one-of-a-kind situation, there are still a lot of overshorted stocks out there. It\`s just a matter of time till retail investors (that’s us) will pick the next one.

I think IRBT is a possible candidate for the next short squeeze. It is both fundamentally sound and in the perfect constellation for a squeeze. Here is why.

**The Company**

iRobot produces the vacuum cleaner Roomba among other household robots. They have a pretty advanced AI and Boomers just love their products. Most importantly, the business is profitable, and the company has grown significantly in the last couple of years. Revenue increased from $656 mil in 2016 all the way to $1214 mil in 2019. For the first three quarters they reported a revenue of $885,6 mil in 2020. In their latest presentation they estimated, their EPS to be around $3.50 for the full year of 2020. This would put the company at a P/E ratio of around 34 at Fridays close. That is not too bad these days. Earnings for the fourth quarter will be released this Wednesday after close. The fourth quarter has always seen a spike in sales due to holiday season. And I think they\`re going to crush expectations. Short Interest data will be updated at the same time.

So we have a profitable company, that is rapidly growing, at a modest price and a potential catalyst. Who the hell would be stupid enough to short this thing?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5euzp/melvin\_capital\_13f\_q3\_2020\_put\_flags/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5euzp/melvin_capital_13f_q3_2020_put_flags/)

Yeah, that’s right. Melvin is. Among others…  
 

**The Setup**

This company has all the potential for an epic squeeze. It is not as ridiculously shorted as GME was, but there are a few other factors in play. Let’s talk about it.

There are 10.5 million shares sold short. That’s 37.6% of all shares outstanding. 

This stock is primarily held by Institutions. The Top 20 hold 48.5% of the stocks according to Morningstar. Most of them are issuers of Index Funds. So these shares will not be up for sale anytime soon. Our experience from GME tells us, that this is quite bullish.

[https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/irbt/ownership](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/irbt/ownership)

IRBT has a market cap of around 3 billion. It is playing in the same league as GME and AMC were before the squeeze.

Furthermore, IRBT is trading at a low volume. Last week there were only a million shares traded per day. This would put the short ratio (days to cover) at about 10. Meaning that shorts would need to buy up the whole volume for two full weeks to cover their positions. It also means, that shorts cannot have covered their positions already.

Due to the low Volume a sudden inflow of buyers would drive the price up instantly. Have a look on the chart at the 27th last month. That was when GME peaked and hedgefunds started to cover their other short positions to rebalance. The stock went up 100% in three days while most other overshorted stocks only increased about 20%. This was probably not the squeeze yet. After the hedgefunds saw GME almost destroy them, they\`ll not sit around waiting for it to explode this time. When the first hedgefund starts to cover, the run to the exit begins. The squeeze will be much faster than GMEs was. I think it will only take two or three days for it to be over. 

 I want you to know, that none of this is financial advice. I’m not recommending buying this stock. I’m also not suggesting that we should pump it up to fuck Melvin a second time. That would be illegal. All I want to say is that I really like this stock. Oh, and today I ate mothballs for breakfast.

qmowcz,2021-11-04 16:48:11,Tesla is valued fairly,"I think people misunderstand TSLA’s valuation. Every post that’s complaining and moaning about how crazy Tesla’s valuation is simply misses the most important points: 

1) it’s a subscription company. Tesla offers paid services in their cars. The premium connectivity package that cost $10 per month. With current production rate if 1 million EVs and 1.5 million next year, Tesla’s revenue will increase significantly not just through selling cars but also through the premium connectivity subscriptions. Moreover, the FSD capability is also going to be under the ‘subscription’ model which will cost $199/month, according to electrek. 

(https://electrek.co/2021/07/16/tesla-launches-full-self-driving-subscription-package-199-per-month/?_gl=1*185lamx*_ga*YW1wLWZkZ01jdFNRT25KRXk4NjlYVjRLMEJUV2RPWDRkYjU4TG9tRDAyUDFZWWJ2RFVLT3NKRGlDeE1adklPZzlfc04.)

In technical terms, with estimated 40 million Teslas on the road by the end of this decade, that will add up to a shit ton of money that comes from software subscriptions. 

A good case scenario is this: (40,000,000) cars x ($210 monthly fee) x 12 months = shit ton of money/annual revenue. (Or $100.8 Billion annually.) 

2) it’s a utility company. Imagine being GM and owning most gas stations around the US. Tesla has the biggest and best charging network in the world that is only getting bigger and better. It is also opening up to other EVs which will have a subscription option or a higher one time payment option. And that already works today. 

(https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-supercharger-hyundai-ioniq-mach-e-test-video/) 

Also, not to mention the actual utility business of solar and power wall, which papa Musk mentioned that it will be as big of a business as their car business. And we do see evidence of that too. 

( https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/teslas-solar-and-energy-storage-business-rakes-in-810m-finally-exceeds-cost-of-revenue/) 

That being said, supply shortage is the biggest problem, but it’s just a matter of time before it is solved. 

3) It’s a Dojo company. The Dojo project is a mind blowing supercomputer which will be at the core of Tesla’s growth. The supercomputer that makes every Tesla the superior car. If there is a future with on demand robotaxis, it is one that as of now only Tesla is able to create. Monetary value will come in a form of subscriptions, licensing to other car makers, or direct to consumers. Either way, that by itself is worth a SHIT TON of money. 

4) it’s an Elon Musk company. Daddy Musk doesn’t fail - don’t bet against him. 

Conclusion: Tesla will be worth much more in the future and it doesn’t take a genius to see that. You could probably double or triple your money with Tesla within 5 years even if you bought the stock today.
 
TLDR: Tesla is aight. 🌈🐻s should stop moaning, and start thinking logically.

Good afternoon everyone,

here are my new ideas for the next week. As usual, the tickers below don't include the charts with my levels, drawings, and indicators, but if you want to go over the text with the charts you can find them in my GD.

I will give some Base-Levels for possible entries per ticker - Please perform your own DD.

l9a9yg,2021-01-31 11:06:11,Why $AMC over $BBBY?,"First of all let me pay my respects to the king $GME. Now that $GME is on the verge of squeezing it appears that $AMC has been anointed as $GME's little brother. This is a mistake because $AMC is diluting via debt to equity swaps and other forms of dilution. $AMC did a 600m debt to equity swap from silverlake this week and I believe they will sell more shares into the market this week or next week to deal with their debt load and lack of cash flow. $AMC is going to take this opportunity to de-lever and avoid bankruptcy. As more $AMC shares are created the squeeze will end.   


$BBBY is more similar to $GME and it was Michael Burry's second biggest holding behind $GME. $BBBY and $GME both have cash on their balance sheet, generate free cash flow, and have their debt under control. $BBBY is buying back between 5-10% of their shares through February 27th and will not sell shares into the market. I think some retards are mistaking $BB for $BBBY. Blackberry has a low short interest and will not squeeze but Bed Bath and Beyond is the the 2nd or 3rd most shorted company behind $GME. Melvin is short $GME and $BBBY but not Blackberry. When Melvin is finally defeated he will have to close out his $BBBY position alongside his $GME position. We can inflict maximum pain on Melvin by raising the cost to borrow $BBBY shares but this tactic will not work with $AMC or $BB shares.  


$GME is the best choice but the most effective way to crush Melvin and get bonus tendies is $BBBY not $AMC  


tl;dr $GME $2000 $BBBY $250 $AMC dilution (no tendies)",170,0.58,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9a9yg/why_amc_over_bbby/,wallstreetbets

[This is a logarithmic BTC chart. I have mapped out every bull and every bear cycle.](https://preview.redd.it/k0ttmde1v8oc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5ba310ae7300c1d7e67cb8007a95e9837b705fe)

I've also charted them all here in Google Sheets. It just so happened that both bull cycle 2 and 3 were nearly identical lengths.

As we can see each bull cycle brings less lucrative profits. Starting with 30,0098.56%, then 9257.17% and then the most recent one 1949.89%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mpmetrn6v8oc1.png?width=179&format=png&auto=webp&s=7644e6061884c6663f61e8813b08c08a15bb3a0d

After that I calculated the dropoff factor for each bull run. The first dropoff factor was 30.7% approx. Which means that the second bull run was only 30.7% as profitable as bull run 1.

The third bull run was only 21% as profitable as bull run 2. This is a 68% dropoff in profitability which I used to get our dropoff factor for the bull run we're currently in. I applied 68% to 21% and got an anticipated dropoff factor of 14.4%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4f9i5xb9v8oc1.png?width=176&format=png&auto=webp&s=433270044204eaf853daa8f2c0535094beeaec34

14.4% of the previous bull runs profitability (1949.89) leaves us with 281.28%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gbvzss4av8oc1.png?width=176&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d1e699be733ac6947c59e2b3c3a7b43047df083

With a previous true market top (weekly close) of 65,145 to predict the next bull market top all we would do is multiple this number by 2.8128

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7vgzxoobv8oc1.png?width=150&format=png&auto=webp&s=22142a34aa46518d72c93d26dcb1de531950ba76

Our next ATH prediction is approx 183K USD.

Since this current bull run started on Nov 21, 2022 (Our first week with a green candle since a bear market) we can anticipate an average of 963.66 days until next top. Giving us a projected new ATH date of July 11/2025.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ul1ez8sev8oc1.png?width=245&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0652203b9769e9184a7245424d9e4600bd4e869

The average bear drawdown is 79.64% which means we can predict a bear market low of 37.3K. The average bear market takes approximately 382.66 days leaving us with a projected bear low occurring on July 28, 2026.

Also worth noting that if we continue to see the downtrend of profitability in bull cycles that is projected this will literally be the last bull market.

Alarmingly for BTC the 5th bull cycle will have a dropoff of 9% profitability when compared to previous cycle. Since the previous cycle will only be 281% profitable bull 5 will only be 27% increase in price.

&#x200B;

The projected bull 4 cycle market top will be 183,240.90 and 27% of that would be 50,920.70

1. Hussle
2. Every time you make about $320ish bucks, you buy 1 share of Goldman Sachs
3. Current dividend on a share of Goldman Sachs is $8.00
4. At about 40 shares, the combined dividend pays for 1 share \[share price dependent\]
5. You keep adding to shares you have, using the dividend to pay for more shares over time
6. At about 1812 shares \[stock price depending, dividend depending\] you make minimum wage \[if minimum wage increases: just add more shares\]
7. When you have enough shares, the dividend yield is minimum wage, *4 times per year*
8. 3/4 of that money you use to live, 1/4 of that money goes to buying more shares
9. Now Goldman Sachs works for -you-. You don’t have to do jack squat and you still become rich. You don’t owe the man, you own the man

In the 2008 real estate crash, Goldman Sachs owned a whole lot of toxic assets. They sold those toxic assets right before the crash, to another bank. When the crash came and the toxic assets tanked, the other bank went belly up because they now had those toxic assets on the books.

Goldman Sachs is murderously serious about making money. Making money is what they do. You want to own them \[partially\] because they’ll pay you for owning shares.

The share price used to be around $200 a while back, the dividend was $5/share. That same share now yields 60% more. Keep those shares and over time that share will yield more dividend. The only thing you have to do is to keep them \[*diamond hands for the in-crowd\]*.

Do the math. One share at a time. Goldman Sachs is not going to stop making money, they might as well be working for you.

199wyj4,2024-01-18 18:27:58,Why I don't think NVDA party gonna last,"I know I know - you all think NVDA can reach higher than the sky, but here is why I say they don't. In fact, here is why I say they have already outburnt their rocket!  
Look at the list below.   
there are only 5 companies at the $1T club, and number 6 and 7 are fighting their asses off to get in. now lets talk about ALL of them, and why NVDA isn't one of them:  


1. MSFT has just this week gained supremacy and passed AAPL. There's no argue why MSFT is one of the top 5 companies in the world. They control more than 60% of all OS on all computers on the entire planet, they have access to us all with their products, and they control 22% of could services world wide with Azure. billions of users world wide uses products they 100% own, and profit of with no middleman anywhere. That's dominancy! That's not talking about LinkedIn which is considered to be the best professional social network, and they sure as fuck monetize this.
2. AAPL since they dropped Intel's processors for the M1 and later M2, they control end-to-end of their production process and have roughly 50% market share of wealthy users world wide, plus 26% of mobile users globally. Not sure if they truly invented it, but they have perfected the subscription profit model, and controlling the spending of their huge users base fiercely! And I bet there's a hidden report out there showing they control the majority of the top dome of socio-economic group. BTW a friend of mine working as senior full stack at MSFT told me they gave him a MacBook when he started working for Microsoft. He's developing MS-Office on a MacBook!!!!! 
3. Saudi-Aramco - I know shit about them, but they control oceans of oil and you know.... oil is oil
4. Google - 98% market share for online searches. plus, over 70% global market share of mobile OS and 12% share of  cloud service. All in-house and 100% owned by Google. Oh yeah, and don't forget about Youtube. Oh BTW - do you drive much? did you know that to avoid competition, Google bought Waze too?
5. AMZN - Well to be honest, I don't believe they have a strong valuable market place anymore and I am pessimistic about their retailing now days. In fact I heard somewhere (and I can't find it now) that they lost almost $10B on their forward sellings in 2022, BUT!!!! they earned over $20B off advertising on site which covers the returns and customer's care. we can argue about that, but we can't argue about the crown jewel of AMZN - AWS!!!! 33% of all data on could, is located on an AWS server. You know NFLX, DIS, and WBD streaming services? Along with Amazon prime, they are all located on the same fucking servers!!!! In fact, unless you're watching Youtube or AppleTV, if you're watching streamers, you're watching it off an AWS server! 
6. NVDA - let's roll back to it later
7. Meta - I do hate that evil empire, but there's no argue that there's no other company with as much user data as they have. Between Instagram, Facebook, whatsapp - if you want to talk or meet someone, it's probably through one of their platforms, and they monitor it.
8. Tesla - I hate Elon! I think he should be in jail for violating at least 10 SEC regulations. But he's still out there and roaming. I won't argue that TSLA is A-Z solution to car manufacturing. Everything is In-house as well, and the marketing expenses are 0!!! But in a world where everybody are looking for autonomous vehicles, Elon's got the most data collected in the world. When they talked about creating a center control for autonomous driving, they suggested Tesla will be the center since they have the biggest data centers dedicated for it. 

&#x200B;

Now lets get back to NVDA - 10 years ago, they were nothing. A great product for a special segment of hardcore computer users willing to spend $200-$500 on hardware no one else even knows needed.  
Back then Intel was God and AMD tried biting on them. But got no where close.   
Then AI kicked in, and engineers found out GPU are better to teach the modules rather than CPU and guess who's the best GPU manufacturer? wait no!!! It's not NVDA! They have never manufactured a single processor. They don't have a single factory. They do it all with TSMC (number 11 on the list, but around 1/3 the value on NVDA). 

Ok so they have the best design. Fuck!!! no they don't!! They use ARM technology to design their processors ($74B market cap). And why ARM are so important? well because couple months ago, NVDA wanted to buy them, so the US regulator looked this deal up, and found out these 2 companies are the only 2 companies to design such technologies and by buying them, NVDA will basically eliminate the competition, and be a full monopoly on ARM architecture processors. so how come one company is worth $74B and the other $1.4T??? because they design the best AI training processors.

WAIT!!!! FUCK they don't!!!!! haven't you heard?? AMD just steamrolled them with Frontier ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier\_(supercomputer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_(supercomputer)))  


AMD has had the best week in their life!! how good? $250B good. That's still 1/6 of NVDA.  
And wait, I mentioned Intel several times before, but what's the deal with them? Well in a nut shell, they have dragged behind. They used to have an enormous market share of processors in the market and they got cocky and neglected R&D while the rest rushed to innovate. But even though you are probably reading this on an Intel based computer, or have one at work/home, and they used to be the sole suppliers for Apple computers, Intel at it's peak was worth $273B (Jan 31st 2020). Still fraction of NVDA's worth. And in opposed to NVDA, ARM and AMD - Intel has always owned their own factories, meaning their worth should combine NVDA and TSMC together!!!!

So the question remains - WTF??????

We know the risk, We know the greeks, we know the logistics.. 

But is there something we don't know? The most important part of the equation is ""Implied Volatility""... WHO TF KNOWS HOW TO CALCULATE VOLATILITY. It's not a black scholes formula it's a black hole.

Do we really know Fischer Black, or  Myron Scholes, or Bob Merton? These dudes won a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, The most controversial of Nobel Prizes, one that many say ol Al Nobel wouldve never wanted. WHY?

 And then why is this a rule? ""information about Prize nominations cannot be disclosed publicly for 50 years.""

Why would they win a global recognition trophy for this formula? In my opinion.. I think its a formula that always creates an upward trend or more so creates an irresistible illusion birthed from institutions holding shares.  

I personally believe the whole market is being Squeezed UP by option contracts.  I believe i've seen companies go bankrupt because of over traded options or corrupt option models. (MDR is only one of my suspicions)

Supposedly, according to seekalpha ""**Trading** in **options** is truly a side play and has no **affect** on supply and demand for **shares**, among either **buyers** or sellers.""

ruqpsf,2022-01-03 02:36:47,QE is not money printing,"Obviously the narrative of 2020 and 2021 has been don't fight the fed because the fed has control of the printing press and will keep printing until the dollar goes to zero. Also that all that printed money has to find a home which basically flows into the stock market. I initially believed this narrative until I saw what bond yields were trading at and realized countries like Japan and much of Europe were doing QE for decades without hyperinflation. Here's a quick example of how QE works: bank buys 10 trillion of bonds from the treasury. They now have 10 trillion of bonds as assets on their books. The fed then buys those from the bank and the bank now has 10 trillion of reserves on it's balance sheet instead. Nothing really has changed since this is basically an asset swap and the bank could have sold those treauries on the open market if it needed cash as they tend to be quite liquid. Meanwhile the fed's balance sheet has increased by 10 trillion. 

Fast forward to late 2021 and the big banks are parking close to 2 trillion dollars at the federal reserve on a daily basis to earn interest on excess reserve. Basically what happened is the fed gave banks reserves and the banks in turn just parked those reserves at the fed instead of making new loans. This goes against the mainstream narrative that money from QE has to flow into stocks. My conclusion is that the stock market effect from QE would appear almost completely psychological unless someone has a different opinion and could educate me.",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ruqpsf/qe_is_not_money_printing/,wallstreetbets

Stock price as of 18th June: $52.71

YTD: -24% (after a 20% increase in past 3 days); 52w high of $100 in Jan and now trading at \~$50

**Short Interest: 33mio shares (23% of float) -** covering of the shorts itself can shoot it to beyond the price targets!

Market cap: 10.7bn with 2021e revenues of \~$1.4bn

Morgan Stanley analyst: We view Sunrun as the most compelling clean energy stock they cover, driven by minimal growth reflected in the stock, a growing 'economic wedge', low financing costs, consumer demand for reliability and convergence of EVs & renewables.

The stock is reflecting \~6y of continued operation followed by zero customer additions - meaning Sunrun will go out of business after that, which is nuts!

The rapid growth of EVs adoption will be a major source of upside and can create as much value as existing set of customers.

Addressable market is large and rising, only 3% penetrated so far. The upside potential is huge!!

You can see the daily chart on Monday that the high went up to the second deviation, just like six months ago. It failed it six months ago. We had 54.5 million volume on January 14. We had 42 million volume on June 14.

[Daily on Left. 4-hour on right.](https://preview.redd.it/wyue26gtva571.png?width=1878&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3f74e3685038a08f6e2a190d6663060bd7dc802)

Will it fail to break another deviation? Typically, stocks that break out will increase a single deviation, as you can see in the chart. But this also means that there's usually a pullback before it retests it.

So if you expect $WOOF to fly on Tuesday, be careful.",6,0.54,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzxxaz/be_careful_with_woof_on_tuesday_algos_are/,wallstreetbets

x6gb6n,2022-09-05 13:31:58,BREAKING NEWS: Robinhood Turns off Buy Button AGAIN,"In January 2021, Robinhood, America's #1 broker and anal lube manufacturer, shut down the buy button. When questioned, Vlad claiming to be ""a young boy from bulgaria"" and ""busy celebrating his hamster's birthday"".

Robinhood faced significant backlash, and in January 2022, they [announced they had lost a significant number users](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/27/robinhood-shares-tumble-9percent-after-first-quarter-revenue-forecast-is-well-below-estimates.html), shares rose 9.7% that day. 

Not to be outdone, Compushill set up a ""memestocks"" hotline and lowered the sell limit for GME to a pathetic $214K/share, all while continuing to charge a metric ass fuck of fees. 

In retaliation, Robinhood today announced they will be shutting down the buy button once again. What's more is, after spending a year and half on R&D, they figured out a way to also shut down the sell button.

When questioned on the high risk move, Robinhood's recently hired Chief Moasis Officer (CMO), Vladimir Tentative, mumbled something about ""being in labor"" and then galloped away. Weird.

Edit 1: 

We have now confirmed that Fudelity, IBKR, Target, and E-Trade are also all in labor. Which is odd, because I don't remember retailers fucking anyone lately.

That sucks because it’s already aced the bar exam and a bunch of other shit so I don’t think you need a jury for that.

But that’s nothing compared to this project Q Star they have been working on. That’s the one where we find out if we will be turned into paper clips soon. 

The lawsuit hints at a major breakthrough that occurred at the time the Board decided to fire Altman.

That was when Microsoft stuck their wang in and replaced the Board of AI experts with a bunch of yeah sures and then gave the green light to go out and raise trillions from foreign investors.

o15732,2021-06-16 13:43:14,It’s time to buy the VIX,"🌈🐻 reporting for duty…

Volatility is the only thing on earth that isn’t at it’s all time high. UVXY is where I am starting to allocate funds. Yes, it hurts in the pelvic region to hold that fund because of the decay, but we’re at an excellent entry point.

We are in a bona fide “everything bubble” brought on by extremely loose central bank policies across the globe. The market has simply melted upwards for the last year because of the implication that any negative market move will be attacked by the Fed. Combine that with “vaccine optimism” and excitement about reopening, and you have people buying the promise that better times are coming. Now we’re reopened, so now what? Here are the risks we face:

1. Insane valuations - The P/E ratio of the S&amp;P just eclipsed Dot Com Bubble levels. 

2. Inflation. Whether you believe it’s transitory or not, it’s here, and it handcuffs how accommodative the Fed can be. The velocity of money brought on by reopening will only make it worse.

3. Stimulus expiration - 25 states have vowed to cut off boosted unemployment benefits in the next 30 days. Yes, there’s an abundance of jobs, but many will not be willing to work for less than what they were just receiving from the government. 

4. COVID- It’s not covered much by the media these days, but it’s still having a huge impact on other parts of the world. Additionally, new strains are out there which will be mobilized once travel resumes.

5. Tax Increases - Remember that concern we all heard about during election season? That’s still out there. Taxes will have to increase to pay for what the government just spent. Corporate and individual.

I fully expect to be called all sorts of names for being pessimistic on the market. Shit is going to hit the fan at some point, and the longer this melt-up continues the worse it will be. All I’m saying here is to remember that yes, risk does exist, and crashes happen.

ljbncm,2021-02-13 23:05:52,How to not get caught with your pants down for cheap.,"VERY IMPORTANT EDIT:
I was looking at some comments and reread a certain part of my post. When I say buy put/call options I mean to buy the same amount of each - same expiry date and same strike price. Often you do this near the current stock price, because it is cheapest, and because you think it will move substantially from that specific price, however you're unsure how it will move. It's called a ""long straddle"" spread, and they're especially successful in volatile markets. If you have a strong feeling about direction,  it might be better to simply buy one of the two options, and that's actual gambling. If I see another stock bubble up I know I'll be betting down, because it's easy to predict an overinflated stock going down.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

I'm a retard who wants to make money, but I've been struggling to make good plays. It's been a fucking rollercoaster, so I decided this weekend I'd  devise a strategy to make sure I can still swim when everything inevitably goes sideways.

I know this is a casino, and the point is to accrue debt - all that fun stuff, but there are always good reasons to take a long position, and with how things have been going for people it is in fact a huge gamble, and it's not always clear when to exit. God forbid the swing happens while you're busy with something else and you lose out on not only profit but a big chunk of your money too.

**During a rise**
The most obvious way to cover yourself is just by buying calls or puts, depending on which is cheaper at the moment. After steady growth over some period of time puts will almost always be cheaper, and the puts you buy during this growth period might very well be more expensive than the stock you had in the first place if the stock tanks 30%. Even if you buy cheaper puts that don't completely cover you, you stand in a much better position to exit.

**Stagnant period after massive growth**
For some reason this is where people think they should buy in, but I assure you if you weren't there for the rise you're literally going to end up buying stock from degenerates who just got rich, your grandmother or a weed farmer. I suggest buying puts below the stock price and moving on to something else, but if you find yourself here with a long position after just getting a nice gain it's important to do one of a few things:

1) get out of there, what the fuck are you waiting for

2) sell everything and buy the calls and puts closest to the stock price

3) sell everything and gamble on one particular direction

4) did I mention to sell everything? I've been mentally compiling data on what happens after a price shoots up like 50% in a day, and I've come to a conclusion. DO NOT WRITE ANY FUCKING COVERED CALL POSITIONS. God, I fucking hate myself so much for this one... At least I got all that premium money, right?

I know all of these positions are pretty gay and bearish, but every one of these meme stocks seem to be overrun by people with amnesia. They looked at a green graph and said ""oh, gee, better buy 1000 calls before I miss out"". It's ridiculously easy to guess when something is completely overvalued, and you can make a lot of money like that too.

**On the other hand**
Alright, I know this is all obvious for many, and I'm probably just wasting my time writing this whole thing, but the opposite applies to falling markets. I already sort of mentioned this, but once the price seems to level off after a drop is when you could stand to make easy money off of uncertainty by just buying calls/puts near the current price. If you caught the stock at its ATH and loaded up on puts, then you probably don't care about this stock anymore and can finally move out of the basement.

l89baf,2021-01-30 00:38:56,Are we inadvertently blaming the wrong people?,"EDIT: I have been made aware RH is their own clearing house. If so, then that shit's fucked and fuck them.

These last two days we’ve seen insane backlash against RH, and, on the surface, for seemingly good reason: they restricted our ability to purchase GME among other shares, at a very important time! THEY SUPPRESSED RETAIL DEMAND DURING A SHORT SQUEEZE.

But I don’t think this was a decision they willingly made, nor do I think they made it in defense of the shorters (although it did inadvertently help them).

I’ve read a few things, and correct me if I’m mistaken about any of them, that point to the clearing houses being responsible for RH’s inability to allow its customers to trade. The most recent evidence showcasing over 50+ shares that they’re restricting trading on, clearly indicates RH is experiencing a liquidity crisis. Why? Clearing houses increased RH’s margin requirements while conducting trades in their behalf. Not just RH’s, but many other brokers as well. 

When a trade is made, the clearing house is the intermediary. Let say you want to buy 1k of GME. RH takes your order, and gives it to the clearing house (it goes through citadel too but let’s ignore that for a moment) and the house finds a seller. They match you together, and the clearing house buys (with their own money) the share you want, gives it to you, and gets your money, but not right away. It typically processes for something around 2 days. They provide temporary liquidity to guarantee sellers get their funds immediately, and they require RH to also put up a portion of that temporary liquidity, as collateral (margin).

So what happened? The margin RH was required to put up increased from anywhere from 30% to 100%. That means if you buy 1k of shares, RH used to only need to show 300. Now they have to show 1k. And if they don’t, I assume they end up out of compliance, which leaves them liable to a lot of bad shit.

What happens if RH doesn’t have the liquidity to show 100% margin? They can’t take your trade, because they’d be out of compliance! So they reduce the amount of shares customers can buy to remain within liquidity margins. Same for other brokers as well. It seems really bad with RH however, because now they’ve increased their reduced stock list to companies like Starbucks and GM. Wild. And with all the public backlash, customers are also probably trying to withdraw funds, causing a liquidity crisis feedback loop.

Now here’s the part that worries me, and again, correct me if I’m wrong. RH innovated by allowing retail traders to trade for free, without fees. Their competition was forced to capitulate to these new standards. No fees, means easier trades for retail. Primarily, in the past, retail’s most common trade (and still probably today) were long term holds. If RH goes away, there’s a chance we see a reiteration of trading fees.

There’s also a chance we see more option restrictions on retail as well. The squeezes we’ve been seeing happened, in part, because a purchase of an option causes the seller to go out and purchase shares to cover, in case the option is exercised. The relative price of purchasing an otm option is significantly less than of purchasing the underlying stock itself, but if many options are purchased, much of the stock gets purchased, and we see these types of gamma squeezes. RH enabled this.

1) Supply Chain Bubble making production of goods near impossible and getting dire.  Lack of chips, energy and materials, transportation delays, worker shortage all coming to a head.  

2) Global financial deleveraging initiated by China's real estate debt crisis.  This isn't one or two companies.  This was policy and business strategy across the country.  Repercussions will be massive.

3) Money printing bubble...inflation and supply chain issues will weigh heavy on equity earnings.  Are assets overvalued beyond reason due to the money printing?  Will inflation reach hyperinflation or possibly a deflationary spiral at any taming of the printing presses.

lj9b2j,2021-02-13 21:07:48,I think WSB is Playing GME WRONG,"I see most of you are probably playing STOCKS rather than options but the irony of this strategy is that WSB or the retail does NOT have enough collateral to actually force the stock price to go up.

At most the retail can bring the price up like $5 judging by the price action last week. And the shorts have been fucking with options for 2 fucking weeks because they can't do anything with dried up shares.

Only way to fuck shorts now with retail buying power?

OPTIONS.

That's why I sold half of my shares and bought FD(options expiring very soon) CALLS

Go to [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) if you want to hold your fucking shares

We initially started to have explosive price actions at +$70 and $100.

That's because there was a fuckt ton of demand in OTM call options for GME. about 100k+ in OTM CALL options.

Don't know what gamma squeeze or options are? Let me give you a ELI5 version

Gamma squeeze = big money buying a shit ton of shares to cover their asses from selling call options to you.

Call options = you make x10 more of your money than holding shares but higher risks are involved.

Basically the more call options we hold the more MMs will have to buy up already dried up shares.

If you have no idea about options watch this video /watch?v=CRhGikRHSu8 and educate yourself. You will become very rich if you play it right.

spah9v,2022-02-10 16:25:54,"“F” – Ford Price Target $50!!!!!, “TSLA” Price Target $500!!!! – SECOND UPDATE","This is the second update to my previous post. I have added two more sections. Debt and EV strategy 

 **Debt** 

Ford debt on their balance sheet that appears under long term debt heading is actually “NOT DEBT” that huge debt figure is the lending arm of Ford which essentially means:

1.  Ford lends people to buy cars and people pay them interest and principal over period of agreed terms. 

2.  This debt is the same as banks asset where in a bank makes money on interest payments Therefore, Debt in their balance sheet is long terms loans that ford made, and best part is in the high interest rate environment Ford is going to make more money in interest payments more than ever!!

&#x200B;

 **EV Strategy**

Ford Ev strategy is fierce and aggressive. Jim Farley understands that he needs to beat Tesla no matter what. He poached the best people from Tesla who have spent over a decade in tesla to ensure that Ford designs and builds better ev cars.  He is partnering with chip manufacturing firm Global foundries to get a better deal on chips. Surprisingly ford has partnered with Google in lot of skill building projects. It is possible that we may see a future partnership between google and ford for their EV software. Jim knows that they need a software partner to optimize their designs and builds. 

&#x200B;

**Previous Post** 

&#x200B;

·  **Product Line**

Tesla have limited product line when it comes to EV’s, their most popular one model 3 and Y whereas Ford has better product line both in Consumer and Commercial including MachE, F-150 lighting and commercial EV vehicles. Ford is racing ahead in the commercial EV line and already has contracts with Walmart and others. Ford has the capability to deliver the commercial vehicles in 2022 -23 to businesses. 

·  **Margins**

Tesla’s biggest strength is their margins -Gross margin – 30%, Net Margin- 15% - 17% 

Ford has lower margins (Gross – 15%, Net -8%) because they have lived in the old ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) world of lower margins However that’s changing and will change the path of Ford history of margins. The new blood in Ford has learned to focus and reduce the margins from Tesla itself and they are working to reduce cost and increase margins. Most likely they will take margins to next level in 2-3 years. 

·  **Valuation & Market Share** 

The most controversial point that has jaded the most of us. Tesla has 900 billion valuation vs Ford’s barely $79 billion valuation. Given that Tesla’s revenue of 2021 - $53 Billion vs Fords $136 billion revenue. Ford being veteran and a value stock with dividends has been given lowest multiples of PE , Price to share for years because people never  thought that they would change or start a new product line, That’s changing now!! 

Tesla has 70% market share in EV market and Ford with 5% but that’s about to change drastically. In a matter of couple of years Tesla will loose their ground in EV landscape and Ford will increase its market share to over 15% with their aggressive line of EV’s 

·  **Moat**

Tesla had the moat with its manufacturing batteries, EV’s and automation. With time and effort that’s diluting and other auto manufactures have been able to manage to produce EV’s and batteries and eventually they will reach to automation as well. Ford is in the best position to beat Tesla in terms of higher quality EV, batteries and automation. 

·  **Marketing**

Tesla resonates with urban people and millennials which is good but Ford being 100-year-old firm comes with huge brand name and solid loyal customers. Fords new line of EV marketing and advertising has already done excellent job and proof is that they have over 270,000 orders within an year!!

·  **High Interest rate Environment** 

We are moving in high interest rate environment with global rate increases. Tesla is still labeled as growth stock in portfolio baskets and Ford has value stock label for decades. Ford has been rewarding shareholders with dividends. This high interest rate environment is better for Ford and Tesla will see winter. 

·  **Team**

Last but not the least. Obviously, Tesla has proven for years being a solid team of technologist and path breakers under musk leadership. Ford’s new CEO Jim Farley is best CEO ford has got in over several decades. Jim has clarity of vision and can execute that vision with smart and effective decisions. Within period of an year or so, he has taken steps to transform Ford to be a New age Auto manufacturer.",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/spah9v/f_ford_price_target_50_tsla_price_target_500/,wallstreetbets

osa3to,2021-07-26 22:45:55,The hated RIDE… but hear me out.,"A month ago, this guy made an excellent case for the beaten down (CEO, CFO resigned over order number fraud allegations, going concern, etc… SLASHING stock price) EV underdog Lordstown Motors:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2021/06/09/with-31-short-interest-beware-of-short-selling-lordstown-motors/?sh=5671135c6c47

And now, the first good news Lordstown has had in months:

https://www.investors.com/news/ride-stock-lordstown-motors-discloses-400-million-equity-deal/

This funding deal (which is optional to Lordstown) will encourage others to follow and also encourage their pending AVTM loan. The stock spiked in the morning and ended the day in red with 3x normal volume.

This is the inflection point for Lordstown. Fraudulent management is out, they affirmed they have cash to operate until mid 2022 (even without this funding) and have affirmed production in September several times.

Catalysts to follow this initial good news:
-AVTM loan
-New CEO
-Production commencement in Sept.
-Projected sales figures

This is a real truck that has passed safety tests and a real factory that is tooled up. Previous management sucked and sunk the stock price into the dirt. There are some lawsuits over some phony preorders that they’ll have to pay fines for… which every EV SPAC is subject to in one way or another.

Short interest is high and it’s primed for a decent squeeze. This is like NKLA, but they actually have a truck and a factory.

Production will be in September. Made in America. A true underdog story happening in a rural Ohio town that needs the jobs badly… and they’ve been on a hiring spree.

CNBC+Cramer hate this stock. Media hates this stock. Ford hates this company. Shitty+crooked previous management+media hate has created tremendous value and a prime candidate for a nice squeeze.

I don’t love the truck and I actually ordered a Cybertruck the day it was revealed. BUT… this company will pull through and it’ll be the first full-size EV truck on the road. This $7 stock will return to the $20’s and possibly more, by EOY.

laxp6m,2021-02-02 15:09:32,"Some thoughts on SILVER, GME and game changing events with dragons and stuff","# Disclaimer:

I   am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I barely   understand how the stock market works. Professionally I'm a   computational researcher -- my job is to simulate complex systems that   my smooth brain barely understands.

Okay fellow retards,

loooong time lurker and europoor autist. So excuse my spelling. Let’s brake some things down:

SILVER:

It’s   a real well played scheme on this. You have to remember there is a   dragon in the east, where people have a historically deep bonding to   silver. And the dragon looooves to take a gamble. So, number one   priority for Melvin and hedge fund friends is to distract the dragon   from GME with shiny silver. Imagine HFs did not throatfuck GME on   Thursday and the dragon banged into the marked, heavy. This uprising of   the dragon is exactly what this autist observed by comments on wsb late   Wednesday, early Thursday. If HFs didn’t screw the market exactly this   moment and pulled some silver shiny stuff out of their pockets, they   would have already been toast.

Besides   that, try to find silver shorts/put options for a reasonable   spread/price which are also available to buy. I tried the whole day   yesterday but at least at my europoor broker I couldn’t find a single   one. What tells you that? Looks like **smart money is not buying the silver rush**.

&#x200B;

ANTI GME  BOTS:

These guys are getting their **bots more and more angry and aggressive**   over the last 24h. But why would they still take the effort, if they  already hit their targets? All this shows to my retarded autist smooth   brain is that they are in deep fear! Hey, bot guys I just want to quote   one of your clients: “What's your beef with me. I'm just trying to make  a  living just like you” ...I hope you guys got payed in advance,  because  your clients will likely go out of business!

Anyways... just to repeat **the obvious: They try to create fear among you retards** and make your diamond hands become weak ass toilet paper!

To   close this part I just want to quote some famous investor from Omaha:   (Be) “fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are   fearful.” I’m an autist, I don’t feel fearful at all. I simply can’t…   But for some reason the bot guys are. They seem fearful as fuck to me.

&#x200B;

SHORT INTEREST RATIOS:

So I hope most of you guys realized, they simply changed the formula to calculate **SI rates**. It’s basically **still \~120%**.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\_this\_they\_are\_screwed\_numbers\_dont\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)

In science you would say they normalized the standardization:

You   take your observed value also into account and add it to your base   value. Eventually your maximum number can only be <=1 or in other   terms <=100%, In this specific case you take your number of shorted   stocks and add them to the float as a base value. Then you divide your   number of shorted stocks by the base value (including shorted stocks)   which can only be smaller then 1 or 100% in respective. ...inflate the   base to make things look completely different… Anyways my smooth brain   is able to convert the equation to the old standard (shorts/float) which   is based on S3s latest 55% short interest rate (Just to make it easy  for your autist brains):

shorts/(shorts   + float) = 0.55 → 0.45/0.55 shorts = float  -> 0.81 shorts = float   →  shorts = 1/0.81 float = 1.23 float or 123% of float.

[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)

...in   addition you have to keep in mind, big players always have taken fines   and trials into consideration as costs. I don’t know what the fines  for  misinformation regarding number of shorted stocks are, but if you  are  scared to death you should:

First   of all, not show it to your retarded smooth brained enemies by   recruiting bot armies, obviously lying, silver bullshit, other FUD,   ...you name it.

AND you are   willing to take any risk to survive. ...or fines   ...in this kind of   situation probably any kind of fines no matter what.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But  why would they do this? Whats their business with the Hfs? You ask  yourself? You guys are threatening soooo many business models in   finance. And this is the real **game changer**!

Keep   in mind: On stock markets you mainly trade the future. You have to  make  scenarios for the upcoming future. And there is a horrifying  scenario  for boomer financial services arising at the horizon. But  first let’s  bring it to the crucial point first:

Look for **information asymmetries**,   google it or whatever… That’s what it’s all about in the end. That’s   the main reason why big players make shit tons of money from small   players. It’s all about information sovereignty. Or the information   monopoly… however you call it. The one who is (quicker) capable to   gather more accurate information and hide it from others, wins. Like   buying your investment decisions and order limits from RobinHood.   Sometimes it’s even enough to convince your enemy that you are in   possession of better information. (By the way, this fight about   information sovereignty is exactly what you can observe right now. HFs   try to convince you retards that they have better and more accurate   information about the whole situation.)

So, lets come back to the bullet point:

Imagine   a huge crowd of people on social platforms gathering more and more   accurate information and take investment decisions on that. Because of   declining information asymmetries constantly draining money out of it.   This will drastically change the current state of the market in means of   clients to financial service provider relations. Making it a more   liberated, fairer market in some kind. ...the whole industry would lose   trillions in the future. So yeah, you guys did it. You scared a big   chunk of the whole financial sector.  Not with GME in particular but with this way of investing.   Therefore from the financial industries point of view this transition  process MUST be stopped and delayed at any cost. This is literally the  clusterfuck for boomer financial services! And the worldwide media and   wsb are the battlegrounds right now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But   hey, I’m just a short minded, stock loving retard, having a lot of fun  on this! GME to the moon! Planing to buy some dips today because I’m  way  to autistic to feel anxious about ridiculous 100 stocks short  ladder  ping pong.

GME is having 10 times market cap than BBBY but making less revenue and gross profit than BBBY.
If he's not gonna even sit down and watch BBBY go up while do nothing why do you believe GME is gonna do well in the future?

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/key-statistics?p=BBBY

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME

But you ask but why would I sell GME for BBBY?

The stock just get cheaper and that the short still needs to buy back shares to close their positions.

Remember RC said nothing and the stock still goes up, the play is a stock squeeze play all the time.

RC sold when the stock is climbing and it didn't made a dent to the rise. 

It begins to fall only the report of his intention to sell comes out.

Short interest is still high yesterday even when he sold all of his stake. So buying a heavy shorted stock is likely gonna net profit.

TLDR: RC is likely gonna rug pull when shit goes under for GME so sell while you still can. 

There is also possibility for BBBY to go way up due to heavy buying from short covering.

Either way RC is not your friend.",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ws00pn/consider_selling_gme_for_bbby/,wallstreetbets
ldpjo4,2021-02-06 04:09:13,Numbers don't lie. If you look at who made money then you need to consider that this whole GME thing was probably engineered by hedge funds (Citadel & SAC) to suck in retail. Retail short squeezing a hedge fund was the only narrative that could have allowed them to sell GME for $300.,"Citadel has access to Robinhood's order flow, their whole business model is to front run you, so what are the chances that a short squeeze flies under their radar? After the ""squeeze"" Melvin received fresh capital, they never got squeezed. WSB lost money. This was probably a set up by SAC & Citadel to squeeze retail with GME. While everyone here was going all in hoping to stick it to Wall street someone else was unloading worthless GME shares for $300. Then they continued from $300 down to $50 while WSB was being advised to hold with diamond hands or to buy more, adding even more liquidity for whoever was exiting.

In the end you guys became famous and lost money, while hedge funds made money but were *humiliated*.

The stock will pop so high all will make a killing but no stock crash and many will not get burnt. For example, this pandemic knocked down a lot of stocks that will go back up very soon. Why not force them back up now before the Wallstreet jumps onboard and when they do, the stock will pop higher. That is how you play it smart with this much power so no one gets burnt.

CCL was previously above $60. It is at $20. Many Wallstreet investors jumped ship in 2020 waiting for a reversal and will be back. Beat them to the punch. The cruise ship has enough funds to avoid bankruptcy, has high demand and will start sailing at the end of May. Which means the stock will start popping. We don't wait, we jump aboard, push the price up to a reasonable level BUT below the prior highs. Then wallstreet jumps in which they will again, they will push it to its fundamental highs. While we walk away with profits. When the market corrects, hold.

I'll jump in with $200,000!

Microsoft wanted to partner with Ford ($F) but had to go with General Motors ($GM) because Ford already was talking to Google ($GOOG).

Position Disclosure: 20 $F 11$ calls for 2/5, 6 $IDEX 5$ calls 3/19

There's a fireside chat this Thursday where they lay out their EV strategy but here's why I'm in safe calls

1. Ford outsells NIO and TSLA byyy farrrr!
2. Partnership with Rivian isn't forgotten and a team committed for a futuristic EV design (more people like how the All-Electric Ford F150 looked compared to the Tesla Cybertruck (and won it in a tug-of-war battle recently) 
3. GM is trading at more than 4x the price of F (buying Nikola and faking a EV Hummer video)
4. Back in 2014, the Ford navigation was using $MSFT Cortana's voice for their entertainment / engagement. I'm sure $MSFT wanted to partner with Ford but had to settle something like $GM because it was already talking with $GOOG (which has most chance of creating driverless cars).
5.  Ford unlocked it's CANbus that year and let developers go to town with their apps. For a moment their cars were used by $UBER and some private researchers in their driverless fleet

It's not gonna move to $50 but it definitely has potential to reach $20 imo. The price action is slow so many of the contracts (at the money) are cheap.",0,0.43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbjl9e/fuck_tsla_nio_and_gm_go_for_ford/,wallstreetbets

2. Earnings are coming up and $TSLA demand is skyrocketing lately. This means earnings will do incredible and the price action you just saw recently will be multiplied (think 150)

3. Elon Musk is slowly gaining back the trust of institutions and people, and is getting ready to have Twitter appointed a new CEO which will let him be focused entirely on Tesla, this means the stock has bottomed and will probably be rebounding HARD 🤤 back to 180-200+ in the next month

ysrao5,2022-11-12 00:02:18,You’re all a bunch of sheep,"*Short term noise*

A stock falls 5% and everyone screams to buy the dip like a Tostitos salesman, but during a bear market everyone thinks the world is ending. $TSLA has fallen ~50% from ath mostly due to raising rates and all that shit but more recently the blue bird and Elon selling shares to feed the bird. 

The twitter purchase is annoying to me for 3 reasons. It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and it’s causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, it’s short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. 

Elon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe it’s stress maybe he’s actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, I’ll leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if that’s actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my personal opinion, I think Elon is important to the company. I understand why some disagree, but that’s not what I’m debating here. 

*”DD”*

Tesla recently hit a PE of 56 with a forward PE of 35. Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. 

So Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I’m sure some of you could say otherwise. 

Tesla is a car company, but it’s also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers. VW CEO stated the model 3 is made 3x faster than their more efficient factory. The MIC vehicles are sold at ~30% margin, recently dropped to about ~27% to meet Chinese incentives. That’s ~20% higher than the industrial average *for ICE vehicles* which have higher margins than EV in general for legacy auto. In the US they are ~15% higher than the industry average. They have next to no debt, no dealership model, mobile service which depending on the state is very good or very bad but eventually it will be very good everywhere. If you look at Tesla without the name and not knowing what they sell they don’t look like a car maker. 

People love to talk about build quality. Clearly it’s not effecting sales but regardless it’s getting better and it’s actually good in China. And if you think this is a non fixable issues you’re delusional, it’s just not a priority. Cars are still selling, as soon as this changes it will become a priority. 

Cheap interior is cheap in cost, and far from “luxury” but it’s durable and practical. For $50k it’s understandable why not everyone loves it, and why some think it’s unacceptable. Not a real issue imo, if it starts reflecting in a loss of sales (after demand drops blow supply) they can easily add some leather and drop margins to make everyone happy again. I don’t see demand dropping below supply longterm anytime soon, especially with cheaper models being announced. 

Ford has only had earnings 1 of 3 quarters this year Q2 667m. Forward PE of 7.4, a mountain of debt, transitioning into a new manufacturing process while also scaling down another, low margins, but they are scaling EV production well. Aiming to hit 600k run-rate by 2023. 

VW has also put in serious work and has expanded quickly but their numbers are easy to get confused as they tend to combine hybrid and EV sales. They’re earnings have shrunk every quarter of this year. PE and forward of ~5. Selling 366k in the last 9 months, so we’ll assume 500k for the year and growth is ~25% Y/Y. 

Tesla can pay off debt with 1/4th of its cash on hand, has industry leading margins 15-20% higher than industry average, and are aiming to grow production at ~50% over the next couple years which they are on track to do. “Some years will be a little less some will be a little more.” Giga Shanghai, one of four Giga factories has a run-rate of 1 million alone. 

So the best US manufacturers are shrinking while Tesla is growing production and earnings at ~50% and ~100%. Yet Tesla is trading at ~5x industry av, remember what happened last time we saw economic downturn like this legacy did not do well. 

The economy is not doing great regardless of what the ice cream man says. Less people will be buying shit they don’t need, but generally luxury items perform better than regular consumer goods. The people that were stretching to afford a $50k+ car probably won’t be buying in these climates. But someone that had no issue buying will still be buying. Even if it’s worse than we thought and way less people are buying cars, who’s going to last longer, a shrinking non profitable legacy auto company or a small lean extremely profitable Tesla? Obviously tesla will perform better in those climates.

China is a threat to domination, not success. BYD has officially passed tesla in overall sales, and are doing extremely well. They’re moving into Europe, I don’t see them moving to North American markets soon. It’s very easy to do EVs in China thanks to the CCP, and they’re growing extremely fast due to soft regulations and a huge market. I think at least BYD will be a major player longterm and possibly NIO. I’d buy their stock if they weren’t IOUs from the CCP. 

I haven’t even touched on their energy business which is growing well and has a new factory ramping, I didn’t include  FSD because it’s not close to being solved but I strongly believe Tesla has set themselves up the best to do it, and I don’t consider the sex bot for multiple reasons. Regardless of not including them any one of these has the potential to be worth more than the car business. 

Thanks for listening to my TED talk, ik reading is hard. Oh and sorry my bad 😩🚀🚀📈

TLDR: Tesla has so much room to grow longterm, with a forward PE of only 35 I strongly believe it has upside potential even in these market conditions.

Position 33.69 shares (ik I’m poor).

Edit: I know this is WSB, but I just want to point out that there was only 1 comment that promoted conversation on topic. That’s extremely regarded, I’m impressed

I would be very concerned and WORRIED about one BASIC and KEY metric, the valuation of the company based on forward earnings. 

Imagine an objective analysis 10 years in the future:

An objective analysis 10 years in the future will acknowledge that TESLA investors believed that it was reasonable to buy TESLA stock with a valuation of 100 or so times of forward earnings... and expected it to continue to climb in value ... despite all evidence that the ENTIRE global automotive sector was about to jump into EV production... ready to compete with TESLA for market share, some with subsidy support from their own governments. Those future analysts will be very, very puzzled and ask the question: ""What were they thinking?"" TESLA is, now, at its apex because it owned the EV market. However, it is clear that conditions will change dramatically and rapidly in the coming year when ACTUAL consumer choices are possible based on comparisons of a great variety of EV models. We have yet to see the coming competition in daily traffic. That day is coming for TESLA. Typical consumers are risk-averse and value-conscious. We all don't drive the very best and most expensive cars... we drive what we need at the best value. Competition in TESLA's space will be massive, brutal, and ugly. It is understandable that TESLA can only lose market share over time. There's evidence that this is NOW happening because of Ford's entry into EV production.

Ford is currently valued at just about 10 times of forward earnings. Ford is UNDER-VALUED with ENORMOUS POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH. Those same future analysts ten years from now will ask quizically: ""How could a reasonable and well-informed investor back then choose TESLA over Ford? It was obvious that Ford was the much better value.""",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rnv04d/best_ev_play_bullish_as_f_mbprivate_analyst/,wallstreetbets

qly6ze,2021-11-03 16:26:55,All in on Meta,"I’ll cut to the chase. I’m all in on meta. Here is why:

Firstly, Meta is outrageously undervalued in its current state. I don’t care if they use “unethical” targeted ads. Use your data to sell me things. I watched the entire whistleblower hearing and it was silly. Not only was she unable to provide specific documents, but her strongest argument was “facebook bad because it makes people feel bad. Government help plz”. The government was like “yes this is a grave matter indeed.” They won’t do anything. The public will stop caring. In a month this will blow over into the dustbin of facebook’s reputation and the stock will naturally ascend back to the p/e they deserve. If you give them a p/e of 30. The stock will sit right around $400 (current p/e 23).

But that’s the boring shit. I really don’t care about that. After all, I’m ALL IN on this company. The metaverse is not a silly sci-fi idea. It’s going to be real very soon, it will accelerate faster than you can imagine, and it will replace reality as you know it. I’m about to explain exactly where this is going in the near future and the distant future. This is going to sound very dystopian, which I agree with, but I’m not in the stock market to be moral.

**The VR explosion:** It’s already happening and it’s accelerating. 4 years ago, VR was a silly thing. Maybe you had one friend with a headset and they had like a few games or whatever. 2 years ago VR was a niche market. With the release of the Oculus quest 1, more people could afford and choose to purchase a headset. But with the quest 2 and the way things are playing out today, many of my friends have VR. And owning a VR headset is no longer a crazy thing and it’s starting to become the norm. In 2020 steam VR saw an increase in user base by 30% and an increase in revenue by 71%. The oculus quest 2 has sold 8 million destroying the sales of the quest 1 by a nearly 700% increase. If this trend is set to continue. The next VR release from Meta, Project Cambria, will sell 700% of 8 million which would be 56 million headsets by 2023.

**VR technology is growing exponentially:** VR and especially AR is predicated on the ability to fit powerful computers inside of small spaces. Applying Moore’s law to the computer chip. It’s been a well observed reality that computing power doubles every year. Meaning you can fit twice the amount of processing power within the same volume every year. Think about that- *All computing progress developed by humanity over the course if it’s lifetime is doubled YEARLY.* The development of face and eye tracking is set to be released on a consumer priced Meta VR headset in mid 2022. Visuals are approaching human eye resolution, and VR is still in its infancy.

Okay, enough about current data. Where is this really going? I’m not sold on it, it seems kinda dumb.

**The crazy shit:** The metaverse is not the successor to the internet, it’s the successor to reality. Within the decade we will see the metaverse really take shape, then you’ll begin to see the vision of where this is going with your own eyes. But if you want a preview, I’ll show you.

1. The metaverse will be an exponential self-sustaining economy that will surpass the GDP of the entire world. Think of transactions in the metaverse for gaming, like CSGO skins. The skins are represented as NFTs. And are traded on the market. Your skins aren’t just for your game though. The metaverse is all connected, and you can take your CSGO skin and use it as an item in another game. You can take your genji skin and go to a concert. At the concert the person might sell T-shirts specific to that event which are also represented as NFTs. Businesses will begin to pop up in the metaverse. I already have several ideas, but will not be disclosing them here. Once people realize how easy it is to make money in the metaverse, much like the internet, there will be a mass migration. A gold rush like you’ve never seen. I could easily see another dot-com bubble level of excitement. The economy will rapidly grow. And as the metaverse becomes more and more real, it will only accelerate that growth. As more people join the metaverse, more major companies will need to change their business model to enter the metaverse in order to survive. Which will be a feedback loop that grows to unimaginable heights. If you want to get rich, be an early metaverse adopter and start a company that sells a service or product specifically useful for the metaverse. The real economy will transition more and more to the virtual and there will come a day before 2040 when the GDP of the metaverse surpasses that of the real world. And it won’t stop there. Whoever runs the metaverse will have an economy larger than the entire world under their thumb.
2. What Meta won’t tell you about the metaverse: By the time you’ve normalized living in the metaverse, you better not care about privacy anymore. I believe the idea of privacy will ultimately be discarded as the price of living.  In your headset, Meta will track your eye movements, your facial expressions, the way your body physically responds to the sensory input of the virtual world. Whether you like it or not, you are a predictable genetic algorithm. And when billions of data points about your response to input are measured, Meta will be able to build an artificial model of your expected output and know what you want before you want it. You might think, wow that’s scary and really good for targeted advertising. And you’d be right. But that’s just the beginning.
   1. Further future- 2030-2050: Once your being is analyzed as a data model (By an AI like a more powerful version of youtube recommended). At this point in time, AI has reached unprecedented capabilities. AI will build entire worlds for you, filled with things it knows you will enjoy, things you’ll want to buy, experiences you’ll want to have. A world far more interesting and exciting than the real one, tailored specifically to you.
   2. But your data will construct something even more bizarre. AI NPCs. Your best friends won’t be homo sapiens. They’ll be AI indistinguishable from real people. Perhaps even alive themselves. Generated based on the data of your predictable personality model. Your true love. Someone literally perfect for you, will be an AI. And it will be incredible. You might think, *that’s stupid this is stupid I’m never going to fall in love with an AI*. You are wrong. And when you’re there and the entity is in front of you in the virtual world. When you can touch them, and they can express emotion to you, you will understand. Your utopia is coming.
3. The metaverse will change what it means to be human. It will redefine our understanding of humanity and even gender. In the virtual world, there is no need to be a human. Your avatar can be an animal, a robot, an amoeba, an anime character, literally anything. People will soon feel better represented by your avatar than your real self. And as we cross that threshold the real world will seem more and more lack luster. The real world becomes a boring place where you have to live with this boring body that has to obey the laws of physics. This will further push the transition to the virtual world.
4. The transition from sedentary VR living to immortal consciousness. As people realize how incredible it is to live in the metaverse, the race for immortality will break out more powerfully than the space race. What is the race for immortality? It means to exist as pure data. To upload your consciousness into the metaverse directly, to abandon your feeble human body and live forever exploring the virtual world filled with real people and AI. The ever changing and evolving economy and ecosystem. To travel from universe as you please. If Meta is a part of this transition, then they will own the platform on which your mind exists. They will literally own your body in a sense. Privacy will be so far gone that it’s a wistful wish of the past, nor will you likely care. Meta will see everything, will know everything you are, everything you could ever want. And they will sell it to you.
5. The Fermi paradox: where are all the aliens? If there are so many worlds capable of supporting life, if there are quadrillions of planets in the galaxy. If they’ve had billions of years to evolve, why don’t we see signs of intelligent life in the universe? Why are we alone out here? It’s not that intelligent life inherently drives itself to extinction. I highly doubt it’s that intelligent life is so absurdly rare that we are the only ones. The solution to the Fermi paradox is that there is no reason to ever travel beyond the solar system. A civilization capable of interstellar travel is capable of creating its own universe- unbound by the laws of physics and the vast distances between the stars. A civilization that can shape reality like gods through the virtual world. To exist as pure data consciousness in a network of supercomputers. Humanity will never travel beyond the solar system, not because we will go extinct, but because we will never need to.

Meta is a company paving the way to redefine the human species, to redefine existence, and to redefine our future. Meta will own the platform upon which our lives exist. This world is terrifying, strange, unbelievable, but also inevitable. And it will be beautiful. It may sound dystopian, but it is, in fact, the opposite. To exist as pure data in the metaverse is the end of death. It is the end of hunger. It is the end of humanity as we know it. On October 28th, 2021, Facebook changed its name to Meta and announced itself as a company fully dedicated to the metaverse. A day that will go in the history books as a turning point and the beginning of the new age. The world is changing, and it will only change more and more rapidly. The end is approaching, and so is the beginning. And I’m ready to be a part of it.

EDIT:

tl;dr: 

\-VR is exploding exponentially

\-Meta is fundamentally undervalued right now even just as FB with out VR

\-Computing power is progressing exponentially which will enable absurd VR potential

\-A separate metaverse economy will explode like the gold rush and snowball to overtake the GDP of the real world over the next several decades

\-VR headsets will take your data and render and AI that can sell you things you didn't know you wanted

\-You will fall in love with an AI generated from your data consciousness model

mwt602,2021-04-23 11:30:11,$SKLZ on April 23rd,"$SKLZ stock hit a high of $46.30 and currently sits in the $16’s. In the last two days, Cathie Wood added over 6 million shares across ARKK and ARKW, her biggest purchase by far. Technically speaking, SKLZ looks to be in a reversal path and the risk reward scenario is highly favorable. This company can honestly grow in huge multiples in the next 5 years and beyond. I see the price here being over $200 by end of 2023. 

DD:

1. SKLZ has 95% profit margins. Yes.... NINETY FIVE %. Although they are not profitable yet (they reinvest all profits into marketing efforts for growth), when they do become profitable, expected in 2022, the profits will grow wildly. They are debt free and have 600 million on their balance sheet however. 

2. SKLZ is a platform provider for betting between users who play Mobile games, the fastest growing gaming market. Think of SKLZ as the Shopify of gaming. $SHOP provides a platform to small e-commerce outfits whereas SKLZ provides a platform to the small game developers. SHOP was $10/share just 5 years ago. The mobile market is expected to double in the next 4 years. 

3. The US is only 10% of the worlds mobile gaming market, and SKLZ is in process of expanding to India this year. They have included the costs of India expansion into projections, but none of the projected revenues. India is a larger market and growing at a much faster rate. This could literally double revenues by next year. 

4. The CEO (Andrew Paradise) has stated as recently as yesterday that his company aims to “gamify” exercise, education, etc. He brought up what a Peloton partnership would look like in a Fool interview yesterday. Essentially, people would verse each other on their bikes. This would make it more fun and add a betting element. This partnership would be HUGE. 

5. SKLZ already has a partnership with the NFL for a developer to make a football-themed SKLZ app this year. They can easily make partnerships with the remaining sports organizations. SKLZ also intends to expand into first person shooters and racing games this year.

m3rqaq,2021-03-12 21:33:22,To anyone who invested significant life savings or taking out debt to go all in on GME,"I went all in on gme last time and held from $40 to $105. This time, I bought like 2 shares and rode them from $160 to $326. I wouldnt have really cared had these shares gone to shit.

Despite what many people who have a vested interest in this succeeding are telling you, a price increase to 800$ is not **certain.** A lot of shorts have already been and are being covered right now. The volume yesterday and today combined is the same as the total float. This is huge. The volume on Wednesday was 71mil., which is bigger than the actual float. While I am sure that the short interest right now is still very high, because this seems like free money to most hedgefunds a further price increase is not certain at all at these levels. Im confident that 90% of shares shorted at 40-90$ have already been squeezed out, causing the massive price increases to $340. The only way another short squeeze happens is if some insitution decides to make it happen by playing the long side and squeezing out the shares reshorted at 200-300$, but this would be very hard, since the price is already so high. Not impossible but NOT CERTAIN. Despite all the hivemind shit you hear on this sub. YOU NEED TO CONTROL YOUR RISK and if you're betting a large part of your life on this succeeding you should sell gme until movement in the stock doesnt dictate your financial security. Retailers are not driving the price anyway, so dont lose your life savings and go into debt because you saw a ""apes together strong"" meme or some dumb shit.  


The most ironic shit is that if you follow wsb advice you can never win because even if a squeeze happens, the posts here will tell you that ""its not the real squeeze, hold dont sell"", so you can never actually profit from it by selling to the shorts that need to cover. Selling to them is left up to some smart retailers and mainly the institutions that are playing the long game on this. Don't help them, HELP YOURSELF. CONTROL YOUR RISK. HAVE FUN BUT MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS DUMB AS FUCK.

TLDR: Another squeeze might happen but not certain. Make sure you know that, even if you wouldnt get this impression by browsing this sub. Don't bet your financial security on this.

kahtqa,2020-12-10 15:58:48,The Next PLTR - C3.ai (AI),"I'll make this short and sweet. 

AI is used for making more accurate predictions. If you can make more accurate predictions, you can fucking mint money. What if you could automatically know how much to price a airline ticket to sell out every single time, down to a penny. How about know exactly how many pairs of size 6 leggings you need to make this quarter down to within 0.25%. How about exactly what ads to show someone to maximize dollars spent on Instagram every year. This is what is happening billions times a day behind the scenes.

This shit is brand new, there is very little talent. [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) helps companies implement AI into their business through their full featured platform. 

&#x200B;

When you are looking for good software you want to find something that is defensible / complex, yet easy to implement, and obviously valuable to the end user. The reason ServiceNow can charge JP Morgan 60 million dollars a year is because it saves them 500. For C3, deploying these models is easy because they have pre-builts that they can adapt to any business, a platform to run them on, is cloud agnostic, and the internal talent that even medium organizations wouldn't be able to find / use effectively. A single AI implementation can be worth 10s, 100s of millions of dollars to an organization, and you don't think they will be happy to pay [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) through the nose to maintain it?

msy7zx,2021-04-17 20:17:06,Extremely thorough CLOV recent action DD,"I’m going to go back a little bit in time and tell you how CLOV was directly related to GME squeeze.
So when GME was squeezing two very influential people have backed the squeeze and caused it to squeeze even more. Those two people were Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya. Both partners in previous endeavors and friends. 
GME squeeze hurt short seller Hindenburg so much that they have lost 40% of their account that week. 
CLOV is backed by Chamath Palihapitiya. Hindenburg, in order to retaliate at Chamath for causing them huge losses, published a short seller report for CLOV few days after Chamath tweeted about GME. Short seller report had very little base, yet that caused the stock to drop and also SEC had to initiate an investigation due to the claims. 
Since then stock got beaten down to less than IPO prices. What does that mean? It means that it was moved not so much by true owners of the stock, but mostly by short sellers. That will play in nicely in the squeeze because short sellers always have to close out, but if stock is still held by their true purchasers it means that there are even less shares available for active trading. 



Enough of history. Retail following:

Since GME endeavor Chamath PAlihapitiya joined the club of “retail gods”.... he is one of the poster babies for retail movement on hurting short sellers. His previous partnerships with Elon Musk furthers retail following so now not only we have GME crowd supporting Chamath, but also Tesla crowd. Both of those stocks were some of the most successful trades in history. 



Friday’s Hindenburg’s fright with CLOV:

On Friday CLOV has opened with 148% short interest and after this was noticed by retail the squeeze has started. The volume topped 250M shares traded (10x average daily volume and 5x its previous heaviest volume day). (Ill get in to more technicals later, but needed to mention this to push the narrative).
Hindenburg saw the action and protecting their possible short position tweeted that FactSet has misleading short interest data about CLOV not including CEOs clad B shares in the float. 
FactSet came back to Hindenburg’s allegations with a reply that CEOs type B shares are classified as not tradable and are not included in the float. And once again confirmed that stock is 148% short.
This further angered retail traders and a lot of chatter online has started how Hindenburg is trying to manipulate this stock with lies and deceit. 
A lot of people didn’t catch on on Friday but through the night and this afternoon Reddit and stock twits seem to have exploded about it, videos are popping up on YouTube. A lot of traction is being created over the weekend for a sweet Monday open. 



Technicals:
*CLOV free float is 109mil 
*CLOV shares outstanding are 406mil
*78% of CLOV shares are owed by insiders and are still locked up. Insiders are only allowed to sell if stock hits $30 and stays above $30 for 90 days 
*institutional ownership of CLOV is at 48%

*the volume on Friday was 249mil shares which only represents 61% turn over for shares outstanding, but if you take locked up shares out of consideration, true turn over was actually 228%, meaning every share available to trade was bought and sold at least twice on Friday. 

A lot of people that bought on Friday (including NEXT financial group that bought 21,400 shares) will not likely be actively trading this week meaning available shares short term will continue on decreasing.

In my speculation out of 109 mil free float Only around 35% of shares will be available to trade this week. Here is how I got to this number: 
-institutions owe 48% of stock and they are not likely to trade short term fluctuations, but giving it a benefit of doubt let’s say that institutions that will hold account only to 30% of float. Now we only have 70% of float left to trade....
-let’s assume that investors that owe CLOV long term account for 20% of the float. A lot of them don’t check stocks daily or sometimes even weekly. Let’s assume that half of them even won’t notice what is happening this week. At this point we only have 50% of float left to trade. 
-the rest of the free float is being traded by scalpers/ day traders, swing traders and “diamond handers”. This is a very educated group and unless scalping or pattern trading will understand that we are in the middle of the squeeze and hold. I believe this group will contribute to another 15% of float being unavailable, assuming half of them will be trading fluctuations and half holding. 
So my conclusion is: only 35% of available shares will be circulating next week being sold and bought over and over again. That’s only 38mil shares not being stuck in someone’s account semi permanently. Some more liquidity will be provided short term by other shorters flocking in, but I won’t take them in consideration because they too have to close out at some point. 

Fallowing all this speculative, yet very carefully vetted math let’s calculate the demand for the shares, just to close short positions
-148% of the free float is shorted, meaning 161mil shares will be in demand just to close out short positions. Since we already established that there will be only 38mil shares freely circulating in the market each short share will only have 0.24 shares. So looks like there are 4 times less shares than demand to close short positions! Throw in some buying activity to that math and you have a number closer to 10:1. 

Following all of that the question is how far the stock can go during this particular squeeze? Well the answer is: it’s mathematically impossible to calculate. Although there are some indicators of what people can expect. Smaller the float, the bigger the short interest and the heavier the volume the further it can go. In this particular instance we have the combination of all three factors. Even if it’s impossible to predict exactly what price short squeeze will hit, it’s possible to trade short squeeze well using technical indicators and trade management. Monitoring volume, daily short interest and days to cover should be adequate. To know when short squeeze is ending I monitor same indicators that made me spot the short squeeze to start with, but in reverse. Meaning volume will start to tapper off, short percentage decrease and the upwards momentum will start to whilt. I also watch out for extremely sudden, needle like falls (trailing stop loss domino effect). 

I hope the read was interesting and I haven’t lost you half way through. 

I won’t go into any CLOV fundamentals or any of that good stuff cause I think we already established that everything is in order there. It is also completely irrelevant in a mathematical squeeze.",457,0.62,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msy7zx/extremely_thorough_clov_recent_action_dd/,wallstreetbets

https://i.redd.it/7m7dix6tdric1.gif

Berkshire Hathaway's recent request for confidential treatment from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the purchase of undisclosed stock(s) has sparked speculation. This move, aimed at concealing specific investments from public knowledge, suggests a strategic play by CEO Warren Buffett to continue acquiring shares without influencing the stock price. Such tactics allow Berkshire to amass significant positions at lower costs, given that any disclosed investment by Berkshire often leads to a surge in the stock's price as investors rush to emulate Buffett's moves. This scenario unfolds as Berkshire Hathaway navigates the complexities of the current financial landscape, leveraging its considerable influence and capital to optimize its investment strategy.

I have a theory that the secret accumulation of Tesla shares by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, if true, could represent a significant shift in Buffett's investment strategy, recognizing the tech and automotive sectors' transformative potential. This move could symbolize a meeting of minds between Buffett and Elon Musk, particularly with Musk's engagement in the Giving Pledge, initiated by Buffett. The potential synergy could redefine investment philosophies toward tech enterprises and forecast the impact of autonomous driving on the insurance industry, notably affecting Berkshire's Geico. This theory suggests a future where Musk's tech innovation and Buffett's investment savvy might reshape the automotive and insurance landscapes, especially in auto insurance risk management in the autonomous vehicle era.

I wouldn't put it past Buffett's team to be running a secretly coordinated campaign to negatively impact Tesla's narrative and share price. The coordinated stories of recalls that are merely software updates could be one example of this strategy. This approach would not only serve to depress Tesla's stock price, allowing Berkshire Hathaway to accumulate a more significant share at a lower cost but also exemplify the lengths to which Buffett's team might go to secure a strategic advantage in the market. This calculated move would underscore the depth of strategy employed by Berkshire Hathaway, manipulating market perceptions to favor their investment goals.",0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1argk38/is_berkshire_hathaways_hidden_mystery_stock/,wallstreetbets

q6t56l,2021-10-12 19:00:34,$IRNT only this week. Out of the picture next week.,"IRNT Gamma potential this week but only this week. 3.4 mil OI on super low float of available shares at 4 mil at the $15 strike all expiry on 10/15. Basically looking at 100% covering if it holds $13 which would 3-5x the price (again) because the open interest supersedes the amount of shares available, which puts it in contention for an infinite squeeze. 500% cost to borrow.. highest in the whole market. I don't think I've ever seen a stock be negative for this many consecutive days without a rebound. Seems shady. I always wanted to achieve the opposite of a short ladder attack, which is **the bulldoze attack**.

**Guide to setting up high frequency trading on WSB:** On any low float stock, if a large group of buyers, purchase 1 share per order and repeats that 50-100 times, we could utilize our version of high frequency trading to raise the price of a stock. The reverse would be a short ladder tactic to regress the price with high frequency selling. This would essentially be it's counter. The caveat is Robinhood, and using their payment for order flow utilization to game the system in our favor. (Ever wonder why when you submit an order to buy anything on robinhood at market price (without setting a limit $ value) your immediately negative once the order is filled?) It's because there is an intermediary using your bid to buy at the lowest offer from a seller first.. just before re-selling it to you after at a slightly higher premium price per share (skimming). Instead of getting the best price at market value at the time of your order in good faith, you have a sleazy middleman milking you for every share. And we buy in the thousands so skimming .0023 on 4500 shares is still a cost of $10.35 to us, under the guise of ""free trading utopia for all"". (Yes, there is an investigation on going currently into Robinhood about this, so let's bury our head in the sand and keep our fingers crossed) Anyway, we could instead leverage this 3rd party to essentially be upping the price for us on every buy order we submit at market value because... each buy request we submit is automatically doubled in frequency with the price slightly increasing per order filled... This would essentially be our manual version of using high frequency trading to level the playing field on low volume / volatile stocks. I have experimented this on $KMPH a low float stock with a few friends and have seen the movement like clockwork but it required us buying 5 shares per order, non-stop at market value without setting a purchase price $ limit (did this about 100 times repeatedly). This only works in the time of WSB because we have strength in numbers and community sentiment during this state of constant battle with coordinated hedgefund attacks on meme rallies. So our focus should shift to optimizing the community buying strategy and develop counter strategies to the tactics used to dismantle stocks mid rally.

In summary: **This is a low float stock, remarkably easy to rally, with a sharp catalyst this particular week to 3x it.**

I think this the type of swing trade folks here have a taste for. I see DD's on $CRSR, about it's long-term deep future projections and touting a low float of 36.32 million. This one has 4 million... Running a stock that trades 1 mil volume per day is much easier achieved than even the current squeezes in play like $PROG (26.44 million float) or $SOFI (614 million float).

To be noted: I don't mind punishing market makers (aka hedgefunds) for greedily overextending their risk on a derivative trade by offering calls exceeding the share count of the stock. Poor risk management has it's consequences.

Most Likely: **$16**

Likely: **$22**

If everything goes right: **$30**

If it matches it's previous squeeze: **$60**

If it goes to the moon: **$108**

&#x200B;

**UPDATE:** **As you can see the action I'm referring to today, hedgefunds have been deploying coordinated attacks on all meme rallies causing losses to wsb while planting their large short positions collectively beforehand. Tad bit of collusion at play.  The notable recent ones have been: DATS, CEI, SPCE, ATER, SOFI, PROG, SDC.**

IRNT would be a firm rebuttal since 90% of the shares are subject to lockup until Feb 2022, so there are very limited ways to suppress a rally.  DATS today was a coordinated short ladder attack by multiple hedgefunds using high frequency trading algorithms because their float is still 12.25 million and furthermore potentially susceptible to dilution by a share offering with their price action. These are the worries avoided with IRNT.

""That said, most of the company's 84.4 million outstanding common shares following the recent business combination remain subject to lock-up agreements (emphasis added by author):Pursuant to lock-up agreements (the “Lock-Up Agreement”) entered into prior to the consummation of the Business Combination by and among LGL and certain stockholders and employees of Legacy IronNet signatories thereto, including Legacy IronNet’s executive officers, directors and 5% stockholders (the “Legacy IronNet Lock-Up Parties”), who held in the aggregate approximately 66 million shares of our common stock as of the consummation of the Business Combination, the Legacy IronNet Lock-Up Parties have agreed that, with respect to our common stock, through the date that is 180 days after the closing of the Business Combination, and, with respect to the Warrants and any of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of Warrants, through the date that is 30 days after the closing of the Business Combination (...).**The majority of the currently locked-up shares will become available for sale on February 27, 2022.""**

j8shnw,2020-10-10 21:16:21,Tesla calls bought me a tesla...,"It was a cold January morning. Tesla was up about 15% in the past few days. I hadn’t bought the stock before, but was intrigued by the business model and being an investing rookie, I felt some FOMO. I bought 2 shares. A few weeks later I sold out at a $400 dollar profit. If only I had known them what I know now... little did I know, that this quick little stock flip would be the beginning of the next chapter of my life.

I repeated the process a few times until the corona dip. At this point I had consistent $ coming in from an ECom business I was running. I put it ALL IN TESLA. The rest of my portfolio has tanked but when Tesla turned around, it brought the whole thing back upwards. I was hooked. Elon had won me over. I was officially a Tesla tard.

Then, in June, I discovered options 😈. I made had a few losses and a few wins. Notably, a Spotify option play that made me around 15k. I made a mistake and sold a call on Tesla right before a run up. It was exercised. Even though I didn’t lose money, I was heartbroken. My position in Tesla was cut in half. 

While I could just buy back in at a higher price, I decided to make a BIG BET. I was confident on Tesla in the long term and I had about $97,000 in cash in my account from the call being exercised. I went ALL in on a Tesla 9/18 call. The very next day, the stock rifled up giving me a 50k profit on the day.

If investing into stocks was like cocaine, I had now found crack. And god I loved it. A few more large options plays later, and I decided to give a little bit back to the one responsible for my success. So, at the ripe old age of 18, I decided to buy a Tesla Model 3. Thanks Elon.

Guess what?  You can never gain unless you sell either. 

Trading is fundamentally easy:
1 Buy low
2 Sell high
3 Repeat

You broke rule one or two (maybe both), now you're holding a bag, and trying to find a greater fool to take it off your hands at more than $450.

Here's some tough love: You won't find one. 

You can run with the herd, but when it changes direction and runs the other way, be prepared to change your mind.

There's no rule that says you have to make your money back on the same company you lost it on.

lxzyzn,2021-03-05 00:47:16,Tech stocks being in a bubble is a lie. Don't let TSLA and AAPL fool you,"I am not going to do the homework for you guys. Just go to any financial statistics website and look at the PE ratio of the majority of the stocks inside ETFS like QQQ. Their PE ratio and net revenue / cash flow to stock prices are not actually up but either stable or slightly lower. The only exception to this rule are meme stocks like TSLA, GME etc. AAPL is an exception too but AAPL's net revenue is quickly catching up. But ETFs and tech stock market in general are not in a bubble, you are looking at less than a handful of stocks to make this determination.

You guys are also forgetting that we are currently undergoing a technology revolution like never before. Covid-19 put technology in the forefront and it's like the invention of the steam engine right now. Everything in tech and the cyberspace in particular is literally going to skyrocket in the upcoming years. People who are going full time in right now will be the winners and history will know it. Jury is out for if these meme stocks are overvalued too because we don't know their future potential (TSLA, NIO etc - minority of the tech stocks). What is happening right now is that safe money is moving out of stocks and either into bonds or cash. Because of inflation cash is going to take a huge hit in a year or so when we finally have the figures for how much Covid-19 cost us in American dollars. So not only will people miss out on the huge gains post-tech revolution but they will also take a big hit for holding cash.

I am not going to say if I am a financial expert or not. It is common sense. But I was never a part of these PLTR, GME and TLRY ponzi schemes. These people are worse than the hedge funds because they are just as greedy but far less educated / invested. It was a pyramid scheme where the first guy in took the most gains. I don't believe in something like a store that sells physical copies of video games to ever succeed rofl. Let's not forget Gamestop offering $3 for a game they would later sell for $40. All you bozos did was bail out the assholes that were invested in an asshole company and had poor retail investors take the hit for it. You people took advantage of depressed anxious jobless individuals and now many of them are left without much. I took a big hit from TSLA too (silly me). But I do believe in the cyberspace taking off big time in the upcoming years and it'd be the most valuable resource imaginable. You are seeing news right now about tech stocks being in a bubble over and over. You are also seeing news about some bond bullshit going up. It's the news that wants you to get out so the big whales can go in cheap - right before Biden administration goes all in on the clean energy and tech sector. Tech in the 1990s was nothing like it is now. India and China did not know what computers were back then, now every person has an iphone and tiktok in their hands. Cars are running on cyberspace/cloud that did not exist back then. Revenue of tech companies dwarfes the oil giants. Currency itself is produced using technology (Cryptos). Globalism / latest tech and the cloud itself has become the most valuable resource not just in America but also in India and China which have 10x our population.

Elon Musk’s Antics Turn Owners and Would-Be Buyers Against Tesla     

Ira Boudway and Kyle Stock           

Sat, July 30, 2022 at 9:00 AM           

(Bloomberg) -- Dennis Levitt got his first Tesla, a blue Model S, in 2013, and loved it. “It was so much better than any car I've ever driven,” the 73-year-old self-storage company executive says.        

He bought into the brand as well as Elon Musk, Tesla Inc.’s charismatic chief executive officer, purchasing another Model S the following year and driving the first one across the country. In 2016, he stood in line at a showroom near his suburban Los Angeles home to be one of the first to order two Model 3s — one for himself, the other for his wife.

“I was a total Musk fanboy,” Levitt says.

Was, because while Levitt still loves his Teslas, he’s soured on Musk. “Over time, his public statements have really come to bother me,” Levitt said, citing the CEO’s spats with US President Joe Biden, among others. “He acts like a seven-year-old.”

Before it was reported Musk had an affair with Sergey Brin’s wife, which he’s denied; before his slipshod deal, then no-deal, to acquire Twitter Inc.; before the revelation he fathered twins with an executive at his brain-interface startup Neuralink; before SpaceX fired employees who called him “a frequent source of distraction and embarrassment”; before his daughter changed her name and legal gender after his history of mocking pronouns; before an article said SpaceX paid an employee $250,000 to settle a claim he sexually harassed her, allegations he’s called untrue; Musk’s behavior was putting off prospective customers and perturbing some Tesla owners.

The trends have shown up in one consumer survey and market research report after another: Tesla commands high brand awareness, consideration and loyalty, and customers are mostly delighted by its cars. Musk’s antics, on the other hand? They could do without.

Creative Strategies, a California-based customer-experience measurer, mentioned owner frustration with Musk in a study it published in April. A year earlier, research firm Escalent found Musk was the most negative aspect of the Tesla brand among electric-vehicle owners surveyed.

“We hear from Tesla owners who will say, ‘Look, I love my vehicle, but I really wish I didn't have to respond to my friends and family about his latest tweet,’” says Mike Dovorany, who spoke with thousands of EV owners and potential buyers during his two years working in Escalent’s automotive and mobility group.

Tesla has so far had no trouble growing its way through Musk’s many controversies. The dip in vehicle deliveries the company reported last quarter was its first sequential decline since early 2020 and largely had to do with Covid lockdowns in Shanghai forcing its most productive factory to shut for weeks. Competitors that have been chasing the company for a decade may still be years away from catching up in the EV sales ranks.

Musk’s star power, built in no small part by his activity on Twitter — the same forum where he’s become such a lightning rod — has contributed immensely to Tesla, especially since it’s shunned traditional advertising. His steady stream of online banter, punctuated with the occasional grandiose announcement or stunt (see: shooting a Roadster into space) keeps Tesla in the headlines. During the company’s earlier days, the trolling and glib comments were a feature, not a bug. They allowed Musk to shape media coverage and made him the ringleader for Tesla’s legion of very-online fans.

But after making Tesla and himself so synonymous with one another, Musk has waded into political conflicts, attempted to buy one of the world’s most influential social media platforms and struggled to bat back unflattering coverage of his personal life, putting the company’s increasingly valuable brand at risk.

Stay on top of the electric car revolution by signing up to our Hyperdrive newsletter here.

Jerry James Stone, a 48-year-old chef in Sacramento, California, who teaches his 219,000 YouTube channel subscribers how to make vegan and vegetarian meals, drives a Volkswagen Beetle convertible and plans to go electric with his next car. He isn’t sure yet which model, but certain it won’t be a Tesla.

“Elon has just soiled that brand for me so much that I don't even think I would take one if I won one,” Stone says. “You have this guy who's the richest dude in the world, who has this huge megaphone, and he uses it to call somebody a pedophile who's not, or to fat-shame people, all these things that are just kind of gross.”

According to Strategic Vision, a US research firm that consults auto companies, some 39% of car buyers say they wouldn’t consider a Tesla. That’s not necessarily out of the ordinary — almost half of respondents say they won’t consider German luxury brands. But Tesla does lag more mass-market brands: Toyota, for example, is only off the shopping list for 23% of drivers.

Emma Sirr, a 28-year-old worker in cloud computing who lives in Bozeman, Montana, gets around with her partner and their two dogs in a 2004 Nissan Frontier. They've been researching EVs for about three years and until recently considered Teslas the only viable option, given their range and the charging infrastructure the company has built in their area. But they refused to buy one because of Musk, their main gripes being his politics, staff turnover at the company and its cavalier approach to autonomous-driving technology.

“We took Tesla off the table from the get-go,” Sirr says. She and her partner have their eyes on the Kia Niro and Chevrolet Bolt as possible alternatives. “As consumers, our power is what we buy. I think younger generations in particular vote with their wallets, and I feel like that might come back to bite.”

For much of the past decade, Tesla lacked competitors that matched its models’ battery range and other measures of performance. Consumers put off by Musk’s mischief had few EVs to turn to. As legacy automakers introduce more capable electric models, Tesla won’t have as much leeway.

“We've seen among the early adopters more of a willingness to take risks or to put up with things that are out of the ordinary,” says Dovorany, who left Escalent for an automotive tech startup earlier this year. “We're not seeing that as much with incoming buyers.” To win this cohort, automakers need to check every box, and for some, that includes employing a CEO who doesn’t share Hilter memes on social media.

Levitt, the self-described former Musk fanboy, took a test ride last month in a Lucid. He wasn’t sold on it, partly he says because it didn’t have enough cargo space for his golf gear. He’s still waiting for another automaker to steal him away from Tesla and considering models from Audi, Mercedes and BMW.

“If you take Mr. Musk and his antics out of the equation, I'm about 98% certain that my next car would be a Tesla,” Levitt says. “His antics put me in play.”",0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wc4gr0/tsla_elon_musks_antics_turn_owners_and_wouldbe/,wallstreetbets

WTF instead of making 1.10 billion dollars they made 1.07 billion dollars which is a miss but for it to drop instantly 22% after that is kind of retarded to be honest .

 Revenue increased 57% to $1,067 million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.

* Net loss improved 64% to $(72) million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.
* Adjusted EBITDA improved 209% to $174 million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.
* Operating cash flow was $72 million in Q3 2021, compared to $(55) million in the prior year.
* Free Cash Flow was $52 million in Q3 2021, compared to $(70) million in the prior year.

Its about 44% from its all time high of 80 bucks so its in a good buy zone . Earnings were good just a loss of 3 million from expected revenue is what set it down and with apples privacy updates. But i think it will make up for that apple privacy bs with the meta verse as the years go on , dont forget yall all those snap chat filters and etc are essentially  augmented reality and snap is still investing heavily in  augmented reality .

TLDR-  Snap is primed to the tits , its 44%ish off its ath, apples privacy changes fucked it but metaverse and new users make up for it, it has a gap to fill from 58 to 77 bucks .

Disclaimer- I do own a few calls on snap , its had a lot of nice swings both to the upside and downside

lek9bx,2021-02-07 10:46:19,but what if we try to invest in GOPRO? (GPRO),"Shares of action-camera maker GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) sank more than 20% at their lows on Friday, and remained down 18.6% as of 3:30 p.m. EST. 

The company announced its fourth-quarter earnings results Thursday night, which showed revenue dropping by more than 32% versus the prior-year period. 

So what
Though the company highlighted the 28% sequential improvement in revenue versus the third quarter, the seasonally stronger fourth quarter fell short when compared to the 2019 period. For the full year, 2020 revenue dropped by 25% versus 2019. 

Now what
Though GoPro reported positive earnings for the holiday quarter, it continued its string of annual net losses that started in 2015. Even after earning $44.4 million in the final quarter of 2020, the company lost $66.8 million for the year. 

GoPro has been focusing on growing its subscription base and a direct-to-consumer strategy. Subscribers grew to 761,000 at the end of 2020, 52% ahead of the previous quarter, and 145% higher than one year ago. The company said GoPro.com generated $116 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, almost double the amount of a year ago.

Customers have been spending on more of the company's high-end offerings; cameras with retail prices above $300 represented 91% of quarterly sales. The average selling price to consumers was up 14% to $323, compared to the prior-year period. 

GoPro's strategy of higher-value products and subscription services is helping turn its business around. But investors will have to wait another year to see if it's enough to result in a profitable year.",22,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lek9bx/but_what_if_we_try_to_invest_in_gopro_gpro/,wallstreetbets

liekzg,2021-02-12 16:29:17,The future of semiconductors and why Intel is poised to win the war,"While you incestuous smooth brained degenerates have been getting fiddled by wall street, always late to plays, ""hodling"" (this is fucking retarded) literal trash like weed stonks GME and feeding overvalued tech companies that never turned a profit. While this has been happening intel has been smoothly bringing in nearly 100 billion $ in revenue.

Yeah Intel is not flashy and is currently suffering from its lack of memeticness but it is an absolute titan in the biggest most valuable industry in the world. Fucking semiconductors. You know what that shit does? CPUs baby, basically everything electronic needs this. This industry is the foundation, the building block of all of tech.

Guess what, INTC designs their own chips but more importantly they produce them. Listen carefully this part is important apes, Intel is the only western fab that has any relevance. Intel's competition in production is TSMC. A fucking Taiwanese company, which basically means at any moment it could be a Chinese company (In case any of you decide to look at world affairs and geopolitics). Intel is red, white and blue, an American stonk. Ill let you guys mull that over in your big brains.

Literally go look at any major cap tech company and look at the parabolas that have been formed (AMD, NVDA included). Parabolas most of you didnt enjoy. Well Intel is a parabola you can still enjoy. Im posting today as it is up 2% and has just passed 60$ an important milestone if you care about shit like technical analysis and the Wizard of Oz. I also know you guys dont like to buy things when they are in the red because you have simple circuit breaker brains, but Intel actually literally cant go tits up. Buy calls if you are a degenerate and you are (IV is low so super cheap still), alternatively just buy and hold and in a few months its 50-100% up.

Most of you guys and girls dont know what a 10k or a 10q is but if you have any curiosity go read the balance sheet and income statement of Intels last quarter. This is the titan of titans, its finances are superb. Low debt, high equity, large and growing revenues in the most valuable and ever growing industry in the world. But thats enough fundamentals for WSB.

Intel is still under the radar of most degens and the euphoria of the current market. It will gain favor, and it will gain favor soon. Do yourself a favor and buy INTC now and not at 100$ when its literally 30$ over all time high.

I didnt mention it, but there is a chip shortage, and Patrick Gelsinger (one of the smartest people in silicon valley) is taking over this giant on the 15th. I guarantee this stonk will moon, might even break the trillion dollar barrier in the next year.

Im long INTC with 1700 shares and 500 April 18th 80$ strike calls.

PS: I told one of my girlfriends husband to buy INTC but all he wants to do is HODL sun fucking dial. I guess some things never change.

I don’t think you’ve ever seen a company so shorted at such a low share price before. Ticker FOMC has already acquired multiple companies and is about to acquire a 50 million dollar company (Smartguard Energy) at the end of the month. 

What’s it’s market cap after it acquires all the companies including the 50 million? Well right now it’s 53 million. How is that possible? Well because it’s obviously not priced in yet.

Now you’re thinking, well this is too obvious isn’t it? Don’t overthink it. It’s because they used to be a zero bid stock before the new CEO Vikram Grover took over 2 years ago. There isn’t much confidence yet and it’s a volatile investment. 

I’d recommend anyone reading this to do some digging because there’s some gold here. This is anybody’s chance to get it way lower than the current investor since the OTC crash.

I was thinking that it might be a good time to start looking for opportunities in the market. I see you guys posting some serious gains a lot of the time and wanted to know what everyone thinks. I was reading an article this morning about META being at a historically low price in terms of value. I just want to know, do you guys think its time to start looking to deploy capital into some of these great stocks that are down 80-90%? Or do you think that things will keep on falling.

I'm making this post to try and have a ""civil"" discussion on where we think the overall market is headed in the near term. Lets say one years time. Is it too early to start looking for these potential great opportunities in the market or is the time now. I know last week the inflation report came out lower then expected, but Its still very high compared to the historic average. That got me wondering if it was just a rally because we havent seen any form of good news in so long that even half good half bad news is enough to cause a significant rally? Anyways when im talking about opportunities, im referring to stuff like they outlined in this article I read this morning, basically it was showing that some stocks are at ridiculously low levels compared to value. The example used was META, its trading at the same price as in 2015 but now its doing $27B in revenue compared to $4B and the EPS in like 5X or 6X higher. I can drop the link to the article I guess, but im really here to discuss the future of the market. Also do you guys think the points brought up about META in the article make sense?

The 2011 $50 high can be seen as the second leg of a gigantic 31 year cup with a now 12-year handle, from which it looks like we are breaking out of..

I personally believe this will drive us well beyond $50 over the next year, and if you look at history, there's a good chance we have a crazy next six months. Here is a link showing a repeating pattern that seems to be playing out: [https://twitter.com/AMoneyfest/status/1727137998985158716](https://twitter.com/AMoneyfest/status/1727137998985158716)

Much of this is predicated on gold breaking out, and tonight we see it past it's $2,000 psychological resistance, which we just closed last week above and seem to be holding as support for now. Silver tends to out-perform Gold during Precious Metals bull markets, and I believe we are entering a new era for PMs.

Global financial troubles are paving the way to more currencies being backed with precious metals (BRICS, etc), while industrial use continues to increase, endlessly. Mining operations are set to exhaust most of the Earth's silver by 2035. If this all plays out the way I think it will, Silver and Gold will see new support levels created for silver over the next decade and won't simply see a spike into a sell-off and subsequent return to undervalued silver prices.

My strategy is essentially to look for this downtrend to be broken by a reasonable amount and then look to see it tested as support, at which time I have a hard time believing calls several months out are not a fantastic fucking idea.",9,0.54,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/184wucc/silver_is_verging_on_breaking_long_term/,wallstreetbets

vcacz1,2022-06-14 18:40:38,I predict no recession in 2022. So tired of the doom & gloom every time central banks tighten policy.,"The talking heads on CNBC & WSJ represent the interests of Wall Street. Wall Street only wants one thing: free money forever. The purpose of their recession scaremongering to convince policymakers to reverse course.

In 2013, 2015, and 2018, when the Federal Reserve pivoted after stock market selloffs to delay tapering QE & postpone rate increases, all the recession talk on financial media immediately went away, and stocks quickly rocketed to new records.

Of course, central bankers don't have that luxury this time around due to high inflation.

That’s not to say there won’t eventually be a recession - in fact, it’s probably more likely than not - but it’s more of a 2023/24 story than a 2022 story.

A recession starting at a 0.75% federal funds rate is simply unheard of. Even with the expected upcoming rate increases, the FFR will still be below neutral into autumn 2022. The economy didn’t collapse with a 2.5% FFR in 2019, and jobs numbers remained solid; Powell only lowered rates to save the stock market & his own investment portfolio.

The economy is even stronger today than it was in 2019, with even more job openings amid the Great Resignation, workers having more bargaining power than ever in recent history, and consumers sitting on trillions in excess savings.

TL;DR: The stock market is not the economy. There won’t be a recession this year - and even if there is by a technical definition, pain won’t be broadly felt (in the form of mass layoffs) until at least 2023. That’s not to say stocks are a good investment - the 2000-02 bear market wiped 90% off the NASDAQ’s value, yet the underlying economy did just fine.",0,0.47,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vcacz1/i_predict_no_recession_in_2022_so_tired_of_the/,wallstreetbets

* Americans in general more prone to spend money on frivolities given low interest rates and stimmy checks
* Huge demand of goods from China almost collapsed the supply chain. $WISH ships directly from China
* Rumor has it that Amazon offered 10B for WISH back in 2015 and CEO wouldn't sell (mkt cap is around 7B currently).
* CEO is an ex-Google employee
* Most downloaded play store app of 2018
* centralized hub for buying random/wacky shit

lwgzjs,2021-03-03 00:42:41,🚨🚨WHY ITS NOT OVER FOR RKT 🚨🚨MORE SHORTS HAVE RELOADED🚨🚨 🚀🚀 IMPORTANT DD INSIDE.🚀🚀,"Hoping this time I won't get immedately deleted. 3rd times the charm?

&#x200B;

SUPER TLDR: 🚨🚨My PT is $73.5. 🚨🚨

&#x200B;

IF you read my first DD and got in, congrats.

Check it out if you're late to the party.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lunv1h/the\_rkt\_is\_fueled\_and\_ready\_for\_liftoff\_launches/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lunv1h/the_rkt_is_fueled_and_ready_for_liftoff_launches/)

There are exactly two reasons for why its NOT FUCKING OVER.

Reason 1: Dan and Jay hate the shorts

Wall street has never considered RKT to be a Fintech company.

You know what's happening tomorrow at 10:15 AM?

[https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx)

&#x200B;

That's right. Jay Farner, the CEO is going live with Morgan Stanley during a TECH conference to have a fireside chat.

You're going to tell me that they just happened to have this scheduled smack in the middle of the week of hell for RKT shorts? You're going to tell me that there's no way they might drop a bomb that truly sends RKT to the stratosphere?

I have no fucking idea. But I trust in Dan Gilbert & Co. to win. Because that's all they've done for the past 35 fucking years. WIN.

&#x200B;

To make things even sweeter, more dry powder is coming in tomorrow- market makers making new options tomorrow. Remember the first time new options came out for GME? If you bought even the farthest OTM one, it printed.

🚨🚨MM WILL HAVE TO REMAIN DELTA NETURAL WITH THEIR NEW OPTIONS 🚨🚨, THUS THEY WILL HAVE TO BUY SHARES. THEREFORE, THE MORE NEW OPTIONS BOUGHT TOMORROW, THE MORE FUEL IS LOADED FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE. 🚨🚨

&#x200B;

To close things up, recall that RKT had 40% interest going into this week. Look at today's graph.

[https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l](https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l)

&#x200B;

Notice those two drops where it halted? See the STRONG support that immediately followed? This is a textbook example of a ladder attack. The SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, AT A NEW PRICE. Shorts ATTEMPTED to shake the 💎👐 , but failed. Retail is NOT ALONE on this 🚀. The DIP is being purchased, even while at an ATH.  Someone is on the LONG side buying up shares with retail.

In my opinion, after today, short interest could potentially even end up way higher than 40%. Look at the candles during those short ladder attacks. Shorts had to have borrow MILLIONS of shares to attempt to short ladder today. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Melvin & CO's latest play to dig themselves out of their Gamestop loss porn either.

MORE SHORTING = MORE SHORTS TO CHOKE

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So that's reason 1. There's a nonzero chance Jay Farner drops a bomb tomorrow that takes us to the stratosphere. But what's reason 2?

🚨🚨MY PRICE TARGET FOR RKT IS $73.5 🚨🚨

Let's go through the numbers.

&#x200B;

RKT's projected EPS for this year is \~ $2.45.

\[LINK 3\] \~ (SOURCE IS ON SA, REMOVED LINK BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING MY POST DELETED)

&#x200B;

To get P/E, take the price and divide by earnings. Thus, we can use this to calculate the forward P/E for RKT. RKT closed at $41.79, which divided by $2.45 is \~17.05. Thus, RKT currently trades at about a 17Forward P/E. Companies in this sector trade in between 15-30 P/E, and since I strongly believe RKT is a growth stock, I think it should trade at 30x P/E.

Thus, 30 x $2.45 is $73.5.

Therefore, my PT for RKT is $73.5. RKT is a fintech company, and is a PROFITABLE one. Think about how many fintech companies have crazier valuations and aren't even profitable?

You know what that means?

IT'S NOT FUCKING OVER. IF SUITS ARE BUYING AT ATH, IM BUYING AT ATH. IF SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZE. THE SUITS AGREE. RKT IS WORTH MORE THAN $40.

&#x200B;

TLDR: SHORT INTEREST HAS PROBABLY GONE UP, SUITS ARE BUYING. CURRENT P/E is 17, GROWTH PE IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE AT LEAST 30. RKT IS STILL UNDERVALUED, AND MY PRICE TARGET IS $73.5

&#x200B;

Remember, 🚀 fundamentally a great company. They are still NOT priced as a growth stock. They are still NOT considered Fintech by the suits. There is a reason why this stock closed strong at a new ATH.

I LIKE THE STOCK.

&#x200B;

🚨🚨My PT is $73.5. 🚨🚨

🚨🚨50 TOMORROW 🚨🚨

🚨🚨60 to 70+ EOW if the shorts bail instead of of doubling down.🚨🚨

THIS IS NOT A 🧻👐TRADE

Their handling of GME earlier this year was awful, and the CEO's look like if a cocker spaniel crossbred with a blob fish. 

Even with all of that though, I'm bullish on $HOOD for one major reason. Expansion.

&#x200B;

Back in 2019 RobinHood ran an private invite-only program in the UK. Only running for a few months, it was used as a test-bed to find out more about European trading. 

[TechCrunch 2019 - RobinHood gets UK license](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/robinhood-fca/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKG7momxcnbzlJ6EJPxz7t0Ux6sSkRffw06WEHg6HLH6mEVcRAwmuKh-l6iar_yuxYhHI3OEVvm72ziwkLocRvJCHvJxKoYFgrUFqquFSLy71LwgCaDQrMpPb2QX6cdT6UB3-MD-HLPZwNq5HSXNUtWqRvjNs3jsS5593QBP0yVE)

In 2020, amidst all of the Covid chaos, RH announced that they were postponing the UK launch 'Indefinitely'. 

[robinhood.com/uk/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-uk/)

&#x200B;

Now, using this knowledge, combined with my extreme autism and a dash of confirmation bias. I believe this is the next move for RH. 

Why else would they have recently launched their IPO. Could it be because RobinHood is a shady company that robs people of their money and is under legal pressures after the events of the last year; that is possible. But I don't care, because my only interest is the share price of the stock, and the number of zero's at the end of my bank balance.

Btw II

Based on the $200 million estimate of *The Little Mermaid*’s budget, the Disney movie needs to make at least $500 million at the box office in order to be a success. The general rule of thumb is for a movie to earn back at least 2.5 times its budget, so if *The Little Mermaid*’s box office comes in between $500-625 million, then Disney’s latest live-action remake will have been victorious. Still, the studio is most likely eyeing a number closer to $1 billion dollars at the box office before *The Little Mermaid* starts streaming on Disney Plus.

Implied volatility on GME option contracts is crazy right now due to all the excitement and price change over the last several weeks. What does that mean? It's a sellers market. The higher the implied volatility (IV) the higher the premium will be to purchase an option because of its popularity and the likelihood  that a strike price will be met due to drastic price changes. How am I making money in this scenario? I'm selling $45 weekly put contracts. What does that mean? I'm betting that the price of GME will not go below $45 by the time the contract expires (Mar-5). If it does and the contract is executed, I'm obligated to purchase 100 shares at the strike price of $45. Why did I pick $45 strike? That's a price I am comfortable purchasing 100 shares at. That's a price I can afford to purchase shares at. That's a price I am happy to purchase shares at. There are a few key resistances above $45. There is the 50 day moving average (orange line) currently around $60 and the center line of the standard deviation channel (white line) around $50. 

[GME 1 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/vmr72tgjzek61.png?width=1525&format=png&auto=webp&s=26b2d4243fb3d1f77e47b4adb9df531675047808)

The price from last week for a $45 strike Mar-5 put contract is about $1.50. Or $150 for 100 shares. Why risk $4500 for a $150 premium? Because I plan on purchasing the stock anyway. Why not collect a few premiums along the way to bring my cost basis down once it finally executes. 

&#x200B;

Next week my strategy might change. Maybe the price will go lower and I'll sell the next contract at a lower strike. Maybe the contract executes and I'll start selling $420 covered calls. Who knows.

1c566i9,2024-04-16 03:29:52,China's Economy Grew 5.3% Q1 - Does this Affect Rate Cuts Here in the US,"China's economy not only grew 5.3% in Q1 but also inched down their unemployment. In my theory a good economy is good for geopolitical tensions as the need for strife is much lower. Happier waters can lift all boats. 

As well, this means that we need to continue our economic growth. I don't know china's monetary policy at the moment but I think they are somewhat loose on their policy with lower rates than higher per se. Not an expert here. 

My question is does this increase the chance of rate cuts or decrease here in the US? 

My reason for it would be that with a China on the rise we must stay competitive and loosen policy. That plus the inflation that is now going to be coming in is from geopolitical pressures that will expeditiously make matters worse. How can you punish the American citizen double because of bad world actors? Tightening a loose policy is one thing. Higher gas at the pumps because Iran went off the rails is something else entirely.

1bf4imm,2024-03-15 03:30:56,The most underrated AI stock nobody is buying,"[ SoundHound AI, Inc. is a voice AI and speech recognition company founded in 2005. It develops speech recognition, natural language understanding, sound recognition and search technologies. ](https://preview.redd.it/v7uhcoag2foc1.jpg?width=3124&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e55fc57324ffc891f913acc27d10774b35764646)

SoundHound AI is forecast to increase revenue approximately 50% in both 2024 and 2025, according to Yahoo Finance. Given last year's sales of roughly $46 million, this implies SoundHound AI will reach $100 million in revenue by 2025.

For this analysis, I'll assume that SoundHound AI can keep growing revenue at 50% through 2030. Should the company achieve this level of growth, this would result in $780 million of sales by 2030.

Additionally, SoundHound AI stock recently traded at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 29.3. Assuming this normalizes to a more reasonable level of 15, for example, SoundHound AI's future market cap would be around $11.7 billion.

This is roughly 550% higher than the company's current market cap. This means that a hypothetical investment of $100,000 would be worth $650,000 by 2030 -- far from $1 million.

A bunch of companies pay dividends, right? And when they pay out those divvies, the money comes from the actual company shares, right? So when they pay the divvies, the share price should drop (at least in the short term) right?

What I want to be able to do is figure out the price the stock will be when the dividends are paid out and buy puts around that point.

Or should I buy calls, betting on the idea that most people who hold dividend stocks are just reinvesting the divvies back into the ticker?

I've come up with what I think would be the ""formula"" for figuring out what the price would be if shareholders all took the divvies out and dropped the price, but it seems too simple to be correct.",5,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/148tdgl/i_have_an_idea_but_im_not_sure_how_to_execute/,wallstreetbets

n1uiek,2021-04-30 14:03:03,MVIS is bargain of the century right now,"So let me get this straight. 

Royalties this year are expected to be $3.3 million for 2021 (virtually double the 2020 royalties) thanks to the $22 billion contract between Microsoft and the US army. S2upid smashed up a Hololens to prove MVIS tech was in it and MVIS confirmed it was their part in S2upids video during their meeting May 2020.

We also now have back on the table the rumoured $100million deal with Sharp who have just had a 12 month extension granted to their exclusivity deal for MVIS tech for a display/smart speaker etc.

We then have the value of 484 patents as of last year, which has no doubt increased in number since then.

We also have the disruptive best in class A sample LIDAR produced this month, which beats anything from  anyone else hands down.  A bidding war feels imminent on this, unless a deal has already been agreed privately subject to maybe one more milestone of them testing it themselves first...

And then add on the other products that they are working on. 

I’m amazed this hasn’t gone higher in share price! It definitely feels like it will be a 3 figure stock for the buy out. 

It just shows how much power the hedge funds have when they short, to drag the price down so low. I thought they might have learned a lesson from GME but clearly not!",96,0.59,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n1uiek/mvis_is_bargain_of_the_century_right_now/,wallstreetbets

wre6zq,2022-08-18 08:40:07,Can we have an honest discussion on BBBY?,"No snide, no insult hurling, no culty or conspiratorial behavior, can we have facts?

Obligatory disclosure - I have a very inconsequential short position on BBBY at $26

Now, to the discussion of the recently transpired events. What is the bullish case for BBBY now, really? Let me point out my view of things, along with some (in my opinion) wrong things that have been thrown around

1. Short interest is still high. There is no discussion about that. But the borrow fee is nowhere near prohibitive. Right now it sits at 67%. If a short believes there is at least that downside in a year, or whatever downside they believe there is adjusted for the time they intend to hold, it's perfectly rational to short.  I personally believe the downside is pretty short term, let me elaborate
2. The filing from yesterday. Let's clear some things out

a) The filing is legit. The report even came quite late, if you look at the SEC website [https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/form-144-email](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/form-144-email) and get the file, the timestamps seem to indicate this document was online already at noon. You all could have been earlier and beat the headline and make a hefty profit, had you known in advance

b) The filing is a clear intention to sell. Form 144 is titled literally NOTICE OF PROPOSAL TO SELL

c) We don't know if Cohen sold yet, or not. Affirming EITHER is the case has no basis. But the fact is that the intention is there, and the filing expressly states that a sell order has been filed with JPM along with the 144 form, to be executed starting 8/16. Why are people denying this?

d) Some people argue that he only wants to sell his options. I'm assuming Cohen is a rational man and if this is the case and he really only wants to sell options, the filing is utterly stupid and self destructive. He could have only filed for selling the options, but no, he's filing for the WHOLE position. He is a whale in BBBY. He KNOWS he is a whale in BBBY. He KNOWS that this filing means an intention to sell. He KNOWS that people are watching his every move, and that this filing would be easily and convincingly interpreted bearishly. WHY, if he's rational, would he make a move that tanks his own position if he intends to hold?

e) Some people argue that he was obligated to file a 144 form because of 10% ownership only. This is incorrect, the only required form is 13D, which he did file on the same day, or one day earlier. There is no obligation to file a 144 if you have no intention to sell.

f) Some people argue that he cannot sell until late September without forfeiting the gains because of Section 16b. This is incorrect. Section 16b only applies for profits on purchases and sales (or sales and purchases) where BOTH operations are performed when the agent is an officer of the corporation or holds 10% equity. Cohen's purchases were done at a time where he held 0% equity, section 16b does not apply at all.

3) Late yesterday, BBBY came with a statement that reads, quote

>BED BATH & BEYOND SAYS PLEASED TO HAVE REACHED CONSTRUCTIVE AGREEMENT WITH RC VENTURES IN MARCH & ARE COMMITTED TO MAXIMIZING VALUE FOR ALL SHAREHOLDERS  
>  
>BED BATH & BEYOND SAYS HAVE BEEN WORKING EXPEDITIOUSLY OVER PAST SEVERAL WEEKS WITH EXTERNAL FINANCIAL ADVISORS, LENDERS ON STRENGTHENING BALANCE SHEET

If you have read enough of these statements, you'd know that ""PLEASED TO HAVE REACHED CONSTRUCTIVE AGREEMENT WITH RC VENTURES IN MARCH"" usually means they don't really agree on terms and are moving forward separately. This FULLY explains RC getting out of the position.

Also, BED BATH & BEYOND SAYS HAVE BEEN WORKING \[...\] WITH EXTERNAL FINANCIAL ADVISORS, LENDERS ON STRENGTHENING BALANCE SHEET. This means in 99% of the cases that a cash raise and dilution is incoming.

Both of the above are, of course, my opinion only and open to interpretation.

4) and this is the one that bugs me the most, why the rationalization? I propose the mental exercise of imagining that it wasn't RC filing this 144, but the board members. I would bet hard cash that this sub would be all over kicking and insulting the board for ""not believing in the company"", ""lining their own pockets"", etc, etc. Why do you behave so differently when RC files the same?

I welcome respectful discussion, I will promptly ignore nonsensical attacks, as I have not made any attacks on my side at all (I believe)

EDIT - Even though I'm of the opinion above, I also honestly think RC is not being malicious here, nor pumping and dumping, at all. I think the board is blocking him, his plan did not work, and he wants out.

EDIT 2- many comments pointing out that he files this just in preparation if he ever wants to sell. Can anyone point me to a similar filing for GME? As far as I can find, he has never filed intention to sell on GME.

18i1s3f,2023-12-14 05:50:43,My employee called me a 🌈🐻 and then quit,"So, I’m a supervisor at Wendy’s and I had a 1 to 1 with one of my more problematic employees. This kid was a full charity case diversity hire, it might be an adult, but it has the mental age of a 4 year old and ticked nearly every box for learning and mental disabilities. It’s so bad I struggle to believe it’s human, it’s full on regarded in every sense of the word. I don’t know how, but it somehow managed to operate the till and thinks that’s the height of modern technology, so much so that it thinks Wendy’s is a global tech giant about to take on Apple.

Anyway, during our 1 to 1 I wanted to try to relate to this thing a little bit better. I know it’s interested in the market (it talks about shorting Apple all the time because it will make the difference in ensuring Wendy’s outperforms them) and this was just as the interest rate decision was going to be made and all of a sudden this thing shouts at me, “oh shit you’re a 🌈🐻 too?!?”. Now, on the side I may or may not have been embezzling money from Wendy’s and may or may not be down $128k. To say I’m f-ed is an understatement. I may or may not have been shorting BTC because it’s obviously a Ponzi. Now, say what you will but as long as I can keep this secret long enough, I will hit the jackpot. I’ve gone with 4x 0DTE OTM options because I know it will eventually collapse, and when that happens this will be the best way to profit from it. They’re virtually free and will pay off millions. It’s only logical.

Anyway, now I’m freaking out that it figured out what I was doing. So, I’ve got to fire him right but I need HRs approval. I tell it that, and it suddenly mumbles some random incoherent mess at me and quits! I was honestly relieved, I no longer had to deal with it, my secret is safe, and I can now fire the guy I pay to wipe this things bottom after it sh*ts. I never liked that guy, but funnily enough no one wants to wipe for other people.

Problem is though, now this thing is hiding out behind the dumpster at the back of the shop. Is it trying to ambush me? I’ve tried calling the police since it’s trespassing, but I can’t get it to go away. It keeps telling me it can offer me a good time for $20. Is that code for telling me it knows I’ve been making $20 bets on BTC using Wendy’s money?

In hindsight, I don’t actually think it’s smart enough to know what I’m doing, so it was probably an overreaction. But I am still paranoid about it all.

Is anyone able to provide some advice on what to do with this thing? I don’t need any investing advice, I’ve got it all under control.

I think my employee might also be active on this in. I’ve just come across this post which appears to be him:

1dg77qy,2024-06-15 01:57:43,Economist Harry Dent predicts stock market crash worse than 2008 crisis: The ‘bubble of all bubbles’,"Harry Dent, the outspoken financial author and economist, isn’t reversing course from his bold ""crash of a lifetime"" declaration this past December.

Speaking in an updated interview with Fox News Digital, Dent cautioned that the ""everything"" bubble has still yet to burst, and it may be a bigger crash than the Great Recession.

""In 1925 to ‘29, it was a natural bubble. There was no stimulus behind that, artificial stimulus per se. So this is new. This has never happened,"" Dent said on Tuesday. ""What do you do if you want to cure a hangover? You drink more. And that's what they've been doing.""

""Flooding the economy with extra money forever might actually enhance the overall economy long-term. But we'll only see when we see this bubble burst,"" he added.  ""And again, this bubble has been going 14 years. Instead of most bubbles \[going\] five to six, it's been stretched higher, longer. So you'd have to expect a bigger crash than we got in 2008 to '09.""

  
Interested to know what you all think about this. I have also been seeing people go into other financial forums I have been in and saying the same thing. Apparently the signs will start to show themselves in late March 2025. I found it interesting that the CEO of Nvidia is set to cash out 700 million in Nvidia stock right around that time. Maybe it's a coincidence?  Please put politics aside and where the source of the news came from. Let's have an honest discussion.
