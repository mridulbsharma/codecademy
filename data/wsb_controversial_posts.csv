u2rhsa,2022-04-13 14:24:01,$WEBR: 40% Short Interest - Grilled Tendies & Roasted Hedgies - Primed for Squeeze," Weber is the world's premier grill manufacturer of charcoal, propane, & electric grills. When you think of WEBER you think all things American: summer days, hot babes in bikinis, beer, hamburgers, & dads, & dad bods. 

Are you even American if you don't BBQ on a Weber?

Weber only IPO in Aug of 2021. Since then this stock has gotten beaten down. 

**52wk high: $20.44**                                              **52 wk low: $8.56**

Hedgies decided to short America's favorite past time: BBQS & happiness. We must do this for the American Dream & short squeeze gains. 

**We going for a short squeeze, boys.**

**This short squeeze has an absolutely perfect set up: we just need volume.** 

Weber $WEBR has a **2.83 billion dollar market cap**, but the **float is only $16.82 million shares**. The current short interest is at an **egregious 40.08% short interest (6.74 million shares of the free float).** The cost to borrow avg is 32.38% with the max at 74.75%. There are no additional shares available to short.  This stock is primed and ready to be squeezed.

What does this mean? It means we're having grilled tendies on our new Weber.

Let's squeeze these shorts for dads who throw back beers & sling steaks. For the babes who eat bubba burgers. 

**For the American Dream.**

181snlr,2023-11-23 04:15:56,NVDA is cooking their books. And so are others.,"Here is their latest earnings report: https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/NVIDIA-10Q.pdf

Their net income for Q3 2023 is $17B.  However their account receivable has gone up to $8B from $3B in Q1 2023. (page 4-5)

Which means they have declared net income of approximately $5B this year which are ""account receivable""

> Accounts receivable refer to the outstanding invoices that a company has or the money that clients owe the company. The phrase refers to accounts that a business has the right to receive because it has delivered a product or service. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivable.asp

Their AR is increasing every quarter which means they are lending out their products to customers .
AR is negative for Revenue Recognition Practices: This situation might raise questions about the company's revenue recognition practices. There could be concerns about whether the company is aggressively recognizing revenue without a firm basis for believing the receivables will be collected.

So what's happening: NVDA is handing out products on credit to customers. There is no guarantee the revenue will materialize especially if the product is given on credit to startups that fail.


Historical Precedents:
Dot-com Bubble: During the dot-com bubble, many companies reported high revenues but had equally high receivables. This was a red flag that revenues were being recognized aggressively without ensuring collectibility.


Million dollar question: Can you short it? NO.

The stock market is like a Quantum Mechanics. Observing it will change the outcome. That is, the stock market will ALWAYS move against retail bets. Do you feel like you are in a truman show where every play you make moves against you? That's because the stock market is designed algorithmically & psychologically against the herd. 

The market news (almost 100% of them are owned by hedge funds) and all the technical signals exist just to gas light you into playing a position that is guaranteed to lose.

This is not exclusive to NVDA. A huge chunk of companies reporting have significantly higher Account Receivable in their earning reports pumping up their ER.

But there is nothing you I can do. 

It's all just the same thing over and over; we can't help ourselves. And you and I can't control it, or stop it, or even slow it. Or even ever-so-slightly alter it. We just react. And we make a lot money if we get it right. And we get left by the side of the side of the road if we get it wrong. And there have always been and there always will be the same percentage of winners and losers. Happy foxes and sad sacks. Fat cats and starving dogs in this world. Yeah, there may be more of us today than there's ever been.

nsgeln,2021-06-04 21:47:13,AMC target is $20 (don't hate the messenger).,"I have no DD to share. I care about price action only. Price action for me is now bearish.

1. Parabola broke today. That's a big problem imo. Parabolic advances tend to retrace 70-80% of the advance.
2. $44.80 is the 5MA on the daily chart and in after hours were now trading below that.
3. We've broken the support level at $46.50.

When the parabola broke today I did buy some puts on amc (at a ridiculous 500% IV) . So I do have a bias here. My target on AMC is $20-$24 area. I'm sure I'll get downvoted into oblivion but thought I would share my position and my reasoning behind it.

Peeps asking for proof of position. Here ya go. Positions opened yesterday when AMC cracked the parabola. Plan is to exit by Wednesday with around a 50% gain if all goes well. Depending on how it plays out I might open a long spot position on AMC at $20 next week. I don't hate AMC or anything just see an opportunity to profit on the way down and just as content to profit on the way back up.

Hello silver surfers, clang gang, and monkeys who enjoy shiny things

Thank you for helping [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) go viral and make it on Zerohedge (dreams fulfilled).

Before I get GME hate mail, let me clarify I am still long GME and am looking for the moon in GME.  I also have a small long silver position.  Both positions are quite small as I am unfortunately not super well capitalized.  Many of the comments about buys on the previous post referenced order sizes I can only dream of at the moment, but I'm damn glad we have so much conviction behind this trade.

I created an official [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/Thehappyhawaii1/status/1355663208774836228?s=20). Not sure if I‚Äôll use it, but didn‚Äôt want anyone to impersonate me.

Clang gang acted so fast, that all the bullion dealers sold out over the weekend which is incredible, and overnight futures are spiking as we speak.  I continue to support the purchase of physical silver as a way to continue the short squeeze if you can find any of course.  The short squeeze thesis is built upon tying up as much of the physical silver into our diamond hands as possible.  With that said, I thought I would add some clarity to my position on the various options out there to play the silver squeeze.

**It is organized into 2 sections:**

**1. the futures market (for big players)**

**2. alternatives (for smaller players**)

&#x200B;

**1.**

**The futures market:** for the squeeze to really happen, we desperately need some of the bigger pocketed players who have access to the futures market to purchase silver contracts on the open market.  **If you can play in the futures market, it is imperative that you do so.**  I have been trying to find a retail broker who will allow customers to take physical delivery rather than force cash settlement but have had no luck so far.  If anyone knows of such a retail broker, please let me know so I can update the post with the info.  This is by far the most important piece of the short squeeze equation.

Let me explain:

When traders hold long futures contracts to expiration, they are making a statement that they want to take delivery.  Taking delivery does not mean the silver is transferred to your house, but rather it goes to the CME warehouse.  You can go pick it up from the warehouse or arrange transfer, or you can pay $8.50 a month per 1000 ounces to just store it at the warehouse (which is quite cheap at that scale).  The futures market allows players to use extreme amounts of margin and leverage, which is where the 'naked shorts' come from.  They are able to sell massive amounts of silver with very little collateral to back it up, and no actual silver on hand.  **This also explains why institutions such as citadel or others hold positions in the ETFs like SLV.** If you have more than 50,000 shares in SLV, you can request to have your share of the silver delivered to you.  They are hedging against their naked shorts in the futures market by trying to gain access to a source of silver should they need it.  The thing is, if the short squeeze occurs, even their holdings in SLV will not be enough to meet their obligations.

In order for the buyers to call their bluff they need to not use their margin power, as tempting as it may be to do so.  They need to only purchase as much silver in the futures market as they actually have money in their account to cover the final purchase (the price is locked in at the time of the futures contract purchase).  Then as expiration approaches, refuse to settle in cash, and pony up the money to actually buy the silver and have it delivered.  At that time the seller needs to find silver fast, and tries to purchase it from somewhere else to meet their contractual obligations.  The rush of all the naked shorts to try and find physical silver is what massively drives up the price and causes the short squeeze.

There may even be dips in the futures market if the buyers are planning to do the squeeze.  This is because they will not be using margin whiles the seller are.  The sellers may be able to push the price down temporarily, but when expiration comes they will find themselves in one hell of a bind when they find out all of the buyers actually have the cash in their accounts to take delivery and refuse to settle in cash.

As the supply of silver dries up and literally there is no way to fulfill the obligations of the long contract holders, the silver futures market will actually be effectively shut down.  The CME will force settle all remaining contracts for cash at the current market rate (which will have spiked dramatically).  This is the last thing the CME wants to do, and will only do it as a final last resort.  If this occurs we can declare victory at having exposed the silver futures market for the fraud that it is.  A futures market is built on the trust that the sellers can actually deliver the product they are selling, and if they can't then that trust is destroyed.  If you go long and they don't have the silver to give you, you will still be paid the money for that amount of silver at the going rate.

Following this collapse the futures market will relaunch at a 1-1 margin requirement.  This means that for every silver ounce sold, the seller will actually have to have the silver or at least the collateral to cover that exact amount of silver on the open market.  The futures market will have moved from 250-1 paper to physical, to 1-1.  The massive banks who were naked short will have lost tens or maybe even hundreds of billions of dollars collectively.  In my previous post I implied it was likely JP Morgan naked shorting.  They have a history of doing so and being fined for manipulation, but we don't actually know which big players are the current naked shorts and who might even be net long.

**2.**

**This is where the rest of us come in...** if you can't play the futures market, you can still purchase and tie up physical silver where the naked shorts can't access it.  Thus setting up the environment for the squeeze to occur.  Whether its WSB players or some other big fund who sees what is happening and does the futures part themselves, they will only be able to do so because of the smaller purchases of silver by millions of smaller players.

**Physical silver:** by purchasing physical silver you are taking silver off the market that the shorts will need when the squeeze occurs.  You aren't directly causing the short squeeze, you are helping to set up the environment for the squeeze to occur, and you will have the silver to sell after the squeeze happens.

**Silver ETFs (SLV, PSLV, SIVR):** this is the same concept as the physical silver.  By purchasing silver ETFs you are locking up physical into the ETF's vaults, which wont be able to be able to be purchased by the shorts in the futures market because they belong to the ETF shareholders.  There has been a ton of chatter about whether ETFs should be used at all, and of the ETFs which is the best or most reliable.  Frankly if you have doubts about the ETFs, just don't use them.  All of the physical silver is already sold out so this is the easiest way for most people to play at this point.  If you prefer physical but it‚Äôs sold out or selling for ridiculous premiums, just buy the ETFs until the premiums come down and then sell the ETF to purchase more physical. It is possible that at some point SLV (or other ETFs) will no longer create new shares as silver becomes impossible to find (thus they cant create a new share because they can't the silver to back it up).   At that point the ETFs will likely trade at a hefty premium to NAV and it may no longer make sense to purchase them.  But that hasn't occurred yet so I'd say it still certainly makes sense to buy these ETFs.  We have no proof that they are lying about their silver holdings, and if they disallow new share creation, I'd say that means they really aren't lying about their holdings, otherwise they would happily take as much investment as we would give them to collect management fees.

**Call options on Silver ETFs:** Calls will have a similar effect to purchasing the ETFs as the market maker will have to purchase the underlying ETF to be hedged.  It has a levered effect that can both hurt and help the squeeze depending on which direction the silver price is headed.

**Miners:** miners will benefit from the squeeze but buying them doesn't help the squeeze occur in any direct way.  People buying miners will benefit if we are successful, but the more capital that flows into them rather than the alternatives, it will lower the chances of the squeeze being successful in the first place.

**TLDR:**

**if monke have lot of money, long futures with no margin and take delivery.**

**If monke not have lot of money, buy physical silver bullion and PSLV**

Hopefully this answered some of the questions that flooded my inbox from the previous post.  Good luck to all.  GME and SLV to moon.  Lets squeeze the naked shorts, expose the manipulation, and take our tendies from the hedge funds.

l7kgnc,2021-01-29 05:32:56,GME rational consideration from a professional investor,"I know it feels like you guys have discovered a cheat code with option gamma squeeze and short squeezes. For those who got in at <$50/share and made 10-50x on options. Congratulations.

I am not saying the populist anger isn‚Äôt justified or that our system is not flawed or that these hedge funds didn‚Äôt fuck up by shorting something with such a large short float. But sometimes it‚Äôs good to stay calm and analyze things rationally and consider the following opinions from someone who was burned by the short selling ban in 2008 and lost my shirt with my puts in 2012 betting on a cascading bank failure in European when Draghi announced LTRO. There are a lot of things that can go wrong with the infinite money machine thesis.

The more the price of GME rises, the likelihood that the SEC will institute a short term trading ban on the stock increases. But vegaseller, you say, we will just Hold and when it resumes  our infinite money wormhole will work again, time is on our side, the shorts have massive margins interests which are compounding.

The problem will be when a private deal is negotiated between GME management and a short seller consortium. It is highly likely there are already negotiations underway between some individual short sellers and the company on a private deal to issue new shares at a significant premium, although much lower than the current market price. Management will be happy to double the shares outstanding at anywhere from $20-100 shares/share, a considerably discount to the current share price. Their concerns are retiring their existing debts and generating cash on their balance sheet for a pivot rather than maintaining their current shares price.

And the higher the run-up in GME share price, the greater the incentive for short sellers to form a consortium and reach a private deals with management and the greater incentive for management to close a deal towards a higher price range. Once a deal is largely settled, they will loop the SEC in to institute a temporary trading halt on the stock. 

If this happens, you guys would be left holding the bag and the share price could easily drop to $10-$50.

There is no shame in taking some money out. Just here to point out how the shorts can still get out at a much lower cost than you think.

So. I've been daytrading since around June of last year. As you can see from my all-time chart, it was a rough journey. I started in 2017 and found wallstreet bets, I was originally trading JNUG and shit like that, which was pretty popular on the sub back in the day. I evolved my strategy to basically ""buy calls on big tech"" and yeah...it worked out. I actually cashed out on a downswing because Merril Lynch gave you access to a higher quality trading platform and information if your account size was over 75k or something like that, so at the end of the day on that original push I ended up making enough to buy my house for cash, around 180k. Think it was facebook calls?

After that, I thought of myself as hot shit and every year around my birthday, I would use the distribution from my family's company as fuel for a robinhood degen spree. Ended up blowing up like 4 accounts? Maybe 60-70k total. Pretty gross stuff.

But then, around 2020 DEC I inherited a fat chunk of money because we sold our family business. Was like 3.4m after taxes. I put a few mil into robinhood and just let it ride. If you check the charts, that was literally RIGHT BEFORE the covid fuckery. I invested at the absolute PEAK of the market. Kinda poor timing with regards to inheriting money and trying to be responsible, but no complaints obviously, free money is free.

After that, I tolerated the pain and was just watching the market. Around my birthday again in June, after getting my asshole reamed for like 6 months I said FUCK IT I can do better than just letting this shit do what it wants to do. I started trading.

Originally, it was mostly theta gang. As you can see, that was relatively successful. That ended when the market climbed over 400. I started daytrading, probably by feb/march of 2023?

Anyway, I've had about two YOLOS where I was 7 figures invested in options a few months out. That first fuckery, I ended up profiting about 85k which was insane. The stress was unreal and I was down A LOT at one point in time. The second yolo was more recently, the charts don't do it justice but I was down about 200k+ at one point in time as well. Ended up selling that second one for a 20k loss.

After that second YOLO you can see I became more disciplined again, its like a 40 degree angle straight up with very little deviation. It was a kick in the ass/wake-up call for sure.

Anyway...my strategy is based both on TA: resistances/support, and being somewhat cautious when getting into a position. I generally will only buy like 20% of what I'm willing to risk at any given time, and if it moves against me I will average into the position. I will sell for about .10 a contract.

I just daytrade, the times when I'm holding overnight are usually because mistakes were made and I misjudged a resistance/support but had enough conviction not to cut my losses.

Usually I will buy another 20% when my original position is down like .10, and continue to average down as it moves in a meaningful direction against my position. Sometimes I will sell for a breakeven or a bit more than .10 profit.

Honestly? A lot of what I do is based on TA that is informed by gut feelings. I've literally spent thousands of hours watching the market over the last 6-7 years even when not trading it. I couldn't accurately explain why I do what I do and its probably impossible to replicate.

But overall? I'd say there are a few over-arching rules that will make you more money in the long run.

&#x200B;

One: Don't go balls deep into a position regardless of how convinced you are of it. Decide what you're willing to risk and only go like 20% max at first to leave yourself room to average down if it moves against you. This will make it so if even you're wrong about the exact pricing, if you're correct about the general movement of the stock you can still make profit.

Two: Be patient. If you've identified what a good entry point for your position is, then stick to that. Stick to your guns. Theres been plenty of times where I missed an entry because it didn't quite hit my price target, you just shrug it off and move on with your life. There will be more opportunities later in the day, or opportunities in other stocks, so don't beat yourself up over it.

Three: Take profits. Just do it. Before you enter a trade, you should have an entry point and an exit point identified and if you sell at your exit point for profit, then good job. Just take profits.

Four: Don't have any regrets. Analyze your decision making process, and if it was based on rationality as opposed to emotion then don't regret your choices. Every trade is a new thing. Even if you end up buying back in at a lower price than you sold your previous position at, if its based on rational choices then don't regret it. Take your profits as they come.

Five: Self Analysis. Dig into why you made the choices that you made. If its emotionally based, then learn to recognize those emotions and what causes them and counterbalance that shit. Otherwise...yeah...always analyze your trades.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Yeah you're a bitch if you can't focus long enough to read this post and you deserve to lose money. Go fuck yourself.",0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15tsz31/daytrading_430k/,wallstreetbets

I'm down on what's in play, but overall way ahead. 

\----

 Many here will immediately downvote this because they do not want you to consider any potential future other than the rosy, all your dreams will come true picture they've been hyping over the last several days. They want you to hold no matter what happens. That's not because it's in your best interests but because it's in theirs.  They'll tell you to ignore the naysayers. Ignore those trying to keep you from achieving your dreams and that anyone telling you to do anything other than HOLD is a corporate shill working for the hedge funds. Now ask yourself, why? 

What you have to remember is that you are playing against the smartest, most well capitalized and technologically sophisticated people and organizations on the planet.  Yes this is an unprecedented event, but that doesn't mean there aren't ways for this to be resolved and avoiding the infinity squeeze that everyone here is praying for.  You're fighting an uphill battle against a relatively small number of organizations that are playing both sides of this trade already. 

**There's still time to limit your downside risk**

Gains and losses don't exist until you exit your position. Until then, all you have is a paper gain or a paper loss.  If you have gains, you should take some money off of the table. If you have losses, ask yourself how you would feel if you woke up tomorrow and that money was gone. If you are truly ok with that, then by all means, ride this roller-coaster to its end, whatever that end may be. If not, however, you should really think twice about whether you are ok with that.  

**THIS ISN'T FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). THIS IS COMMON SENSE**

I'm ok losing the remaining holdings i have in $GME. This is a small amount of my personal portfolio. Many on here may not be in the same position. I've read countless threads and posts of people taking their last dollar, siphoning credit cards for cash advances, taking loans on their homes...it's insane. Yes it's a unique situation, but the professional traders who have done this and do this every day, all day for years and years can act faster than you, have a strategy and have the capital to chip away at this making money regardless of what happens going forward.  

**Wallstreetbets is not some magical subreddit with inside info and guaranteed path to millions** 

there are some very smart people here, don't get me wrong. I've made a lot of money that i never would have had i not dug into the info that I was first exposed to here.  But, for every legitimately smart investor/trader/autist on the sub, there's a cohort of people who want nothing more than to separate others from their money and have no qualms about manipulating you and your desire for an easy win. It's human nature and it's been happening for as long as people could understand the concept of easy money.  If you've read the recent reports on Silver, that's an example of a small group of well-coordinated people taking advantage of the situation with newbies and others who may not even be on here. That said, im limiting this to $GME. 

**NOBODY IS GOING TO TELL YOU IT'S TIME TO SELL. THEY'LL ONLY TELL YOU WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD**

It's easy to get everyone on board with idea to buy, and when you're being told the price can go to $10,000 (I've actually seen people legitimately saying it could go much higher), the price you buy at doesn't matter. The same cannot be said for the price at which you sell.  Reading the threads, it might feel like everyone is acting in concert, but not everyone on here is honest. Not everyone here is doing what they say they're doing. Not everyone here gives a damn about you, even if they say they do. Don't allow your confirmation bias to convince yourself to do something you know inside is a bad decision. Invest only what you can afford to lose - period. 

**Winning a war against Wall St. sounds great, but you really need to understand what you're up against**

Shares are bought and sold by professionals in fractions of a second. In the time it took you to read this, the price of GME has fluctuated by as much as $60.  Those who want to pull on your emotions are going to do whatever they can to have you focus on the Us against Them argument, but the fact of the matter is Robinhood isn't a very well capitalized organization, which is why they aren't allowing larger share purchases. Other brokers that don't have the volume that RH has had are taking orders without restriction, but that's because they have not yet hit the level of volume where their clearing capabilities and capital requirements will come into play. If everyone from RH suddenly went to WeBull  for example, you'd likely see the same thing happen there once volume in GME spiked. 

&#x200B;

BE SAFE. BE SMART. RISK ONLY WHAT YOU CAN LOSE. 

TL/DR: Think for yourself and make decisions based on your own risk tolerance. There are people acting in their own best interests who need you to act in a certain way in order for it to work. This is a zero-sum game. if there's going to be winners, there have to be losers.",41,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la84a0/if_you_got_caught_up_in_the_gme_frenzy_and_are/,wallstreetbets

CEO Aaron sold 7m worth of stock 

NEW EDIT: AMC just announced in their 10k to pursue dilutive equity raises ( debt for equity swaps)

Citing: 

Other Creditor Discussions. While the liquidity we have raised has substantially extended our liquidity runway, the new debt we have issued, together with the higher interest rate payments that will be required in the future but have largely been deferred, will substantially increase our leverage and future cash requirements. These future cash requirements, like our deferred rent obligations, will present a challenge to our long-term viability if our operating income does not return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Even then, we believe we will need to engage in discussions with our creditors to substantially reduce our leverage. We expect to continue to explore alternatives that include new-money financing, potentially in connection with converting debt to equity, which would help manage our leverage but would be dilutive to holders of our common stock. We expect we will continue to receive from and discuss proposals with all classes of creditors. These discussions may not result in any agreement on commercially acceptable terms.


EDIT: I feel like I should respond here to some comments below:

\- Everything I said is factual. It's all linked to the official SEC docs of AMC or Bloomberg as a reliable source. 

\- Its a fact that share count increased to 450m. its a fact that roughly 50m shares are shorted.. .its a fact that even if you add in all the call options you barely get to any squeeze .. these are all facts

\- the fact that I have access to a Bloomberg terminal does not make any difference

\- If you really think I want to drive the share price by posting here.. sorry you are bloody stupid then. AMC trades like 2.5bn every day!!.. Mr bag holder dildo with his 50 shares has no influence lol 

\- yes my account is new. I looked at this once my friends asked me whether to invest in AMC or GME. I know AMC very very very well. I never looked at GME. 

\- I find it irresponsible that unsophisticated people with little money gamble away all their savings by being tricked into a Hoax

\- I did this post so ppl can get the facts right 

&#x200B;

/End of Edit

&#x200B;

I have been flagging dilution at AMC before and I want to touch on this further in this DD.

# 1. AMC increased its share count from roughly 100m to 450m in the last few month alone.

This is a link to AMC latest quarterly release:

[https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0a2146ef-7cb0-43b1-b96f-33c1681e146e.html](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0a2146ef-7cb0-43b1-b96f-33c1681e146e.html)

**Lets count just how many shares have been issued:**

From the above picture: 15+15+20+200+50+44.4 = 344.4 . this compares to a starting share count of 103.8m so total shares out is now 448m (and that does not include all the restricted stock options management issued to themselves)

Which I estimate is another 6m.

ÔÉ® Bottom line share count went up by 4.5x

ÔÉ® And this is all float.. no institutional holders.. (Wanda converted there B shares to A shares to sell them)

# 2. Furthermore the company will keep issuing more shares.

They have another 70m left to issue which will likely be issues in the next days to come.

And ‚Ä¶ here it comes:

The company just filed an Annul general meeting to increase the share count by another 500m.

See this link:

[http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/9f348412-ec88-4159-a092-631da0404d66.html](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/9f348412-ec88-4159-a092-631da0404d66.html)

# Operationally it‚Äôs a severely struggling business:

\- The company burned through 125m a month in Q4

\- That burn will step up to 150m per month in H2 as management has stated at yday call.

\- They have 1bn of cash on hand but that will go down fast

\- Debt is now higher then pre corona and there is another 450m of unpaid rent

\- Share count is 4.5 pre covid .. so today‚Äôs share price really means around 48USD compred to pre covid dilution ‚Äì pre covid it was trading at 6-8USD

\- Remember AMC wasn‚Äôt even able to generate any cash pre- covid

\- The stock rally has saved the debt holders because AMC might indeed be able to avoid bankruptcy.. but given the dilution the stock is still effectively worthless

There is not even that much squeeze potential:

# Lets look at the facts:

# 1. Stocks shorted 55.5m ??

That is a whopping ;) 12.3% of float‚Ä¶. And compares to 260m shares traded yday.. so to cover all shorts you need about 20% of the daily volume.

Stock is liquid to borrow

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fof2wnb7edm61.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=c73dcf2434b9d689a2246eabd1af28f5d0359c98

short interest

# 2. But what about a gamma squeeze ???

Again lets look at the facts.

The open interest in all calls is 1.27m .. against that we have 0.684m puts.

Lets totally ignore the puts which have a stable effect on the share price.. lets assume those don‚Äôt exist.

1.27m calls are equivalent to still a high number of 127m shares‚Ä¶

Many of these calls are out of the money..

But hey let's assume ALL the calls end up in the money.

That is 127m shares.. add that to the 55m shorted and you end up at 237m .. which is still only 50% of float!!

Also this compares to 1!!!!! Daily volume.. far from critical.

More realistically assuming a 30% delta and 50% put offset its more an extra 17m shares from calls.

This is not going to the moon.. The fundamentals are not there.

The reason why dildos get exited is that they look at outdated statistics about the shares outstanding and think it is sooo highly shorted.. but the fact is it isn‚Äôt.

m7l0p0,2021-03-18 06:47:02,GME DISINFO EXPOSED #1: Why the ‚Äú$GME MOASS‚Äô‚Äù post that hit the front page is pure BULLSHIT,"There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation going around WSB right now, and the common knowledge is that hedge funds shorting GME are the source of it. Unfortunately, common knowledge isn‚Äôt always correct knowledge. The reality is that much of the disinformation being spread on WSB right now is very pro-GME, and the new crowd here, which consists mostly of greenhorn traders (who don‚Äôt really understand how the market functions) is lapping it up. The [people ‚Äî 600 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/) participating in this disinformation campaign often intentionally reach the wrong conclusions after overloading posts with very technical information that most greenhorn traders do not understand, or even just [make terms up](https://postimg.cc/B8W93Yth) ‚Äî [Source ‚Äî 18.5k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5zoos/gme_how_the_dip_today_was_due_to_etf_shares_being/)

There are many common tricks they use to positively manipulate sentiment surrounding GME. I wrote about it a bit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m68ybj/comment/gr6asm3?context=3). Unfortunately, that post was deleted by Automod when I edited a YouTube link into the text, and the mod team did not respond to requests to restore the post.

Regardless, I‚Äôve noticed many of the same pro-GME talking points being recycled ‚Äî often by brand new accounts that have a post history of begging for karma and posting exclusively about GME. You can love the stock, that‚Äôs fine, but if you *really* love the stock, it‚Äôs important to know how you‚Äôre being misled and lied to by posts that frequently hit the front page. In this thread, I‚Äôll be addressing [this post ‚Äî 21.1k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m79wdx/why_the_gme_moass_mother_of_all_short_squeezes_is/) specifically, and I‚Äôll also be linking to similar shady posts that parrot the same baseless or misleading claims.

**Claim #1: GME is inversely-correlated with the broader market because the squeeze forces institutions to sell long positions to protect against margin calls**

There does seem to be *some* correlation between GME and the broader market, but this doesn‚Äôt imply causation (or shorts getting squeezed). It‚Äôs not uncommon for meme stocks to do well while the rest of the market is selling off. [Exhibit A](https://postimg.cc/PvGJgzYY) ‚Äî [Exhibit B](https://postimg.cc/1VpXsnrT) ‚Äî notice how RIOT‚Äôs peak in 2018 coincides with SPY‚Äôs trough? That‚Äôs correlation, but not causation. Why does this happen? I can‚Äôt say for sure, but my guess is that stocks like this have a lot of volatility, so when funds pull out of the broader market, they place their wealth in these volatile stocks as kind of a ‚Äústore‚Äù of wealth until the sell-off is finished, at which point they cash out and re-enter the market. Just speculating, though.

What I *can* prove, however, is that the claim that the broader market and GME are inversely correlated is **complete bullshit**, and it takes only [the barest, most basic amount of research](https://postimg.cc/jDjfQcXS). Here, I‚Äôve overlayed the S&P 500 with GME. If there were any correlation, you would see GME go down roughly whenever SPY went up, and vice-versa. Not good enough? Think GME ought to be valued as a tech company? [Nasdaq similary shows no correlation](https://postimg.cc/VdgMCpXh). Yes, I know the overlays aren‚Äôt perfect, but I‚Äôm working on an iPad here ‚Äî cut me some slack. Regardless, you can see there is **no correlation**, proving that this part of Bows_N_Hoes post is **bullshit**.

For the record, I *do* think there was an inverse correlation between GME and the broader market back in February. In my opinion, there genuinely was a threat of system collapse. The IBKR chairman himself admitted that. (Request a link to the vid in comments and I‚Äôll provide. I can‚Äôt post it in OP or my post will get whacked). In this case, hedge funds likely *did* have to sell some of their positions to free up liquidity so that they could cover or protect their shorts. This led to the broader market falling while GME squoze. As demonstrated, this correlation no longer exists.

Note: This claim is about inverse correlation is the same as [another unfounded claim ‚Äî 4.4k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6if56/the_mythical_unicorn_aka_extremely_abnormal/) that hit the front page of WSB, and which one of WSB‚Äôs mods similarly dismantled.

**Claim 2: The illegal practice of naked short selling is causing the stock to show over 140% ownership**

The post claims that short shares are being invented out of thin air and sold on the market. While this is theoretically possible (but illegal!), this is pure speculation. So how then, might you ask, can a stock display over 100% ownership? When stocks are shorted, they are *borrowed* from someone who owns the stock, and then sold. Now, the same shares can be lent from one person to another to another. All of the entities borrowind the stock must report ownership of the stock. So, imagine it this way: I lend my dildo to my friend, and then *he* lends that dildo to *his* friend. I would report owning that dildo, my friend would report owning that dildo (albeit temporarily) and *his* friend would report owning that dildo. So you see how one single dildo can become three? [Investopedia even has an article about this](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp ). The same thing is happening to GME, and any claims that higher than 100% institutional ownership being indicative of the illegal practice of short selling is pure speculation, of which no one has yet provided proof.

**Claim #3: No seriously, these ‚Äúsynthetic shares‚Äù are real, and are being sold back and forth on the market place!**

Do you know what you get when you Google ‚Äúsynthetic shares‚Äù? A bunch of [Indian biomed companies](https://postimg.cc/FYc2syMD) with ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù in their company name. Do you know what happens when you control for these Indian biomed companies?  You get results that are [basically nothing](https://postimg.cc/xcBw2x4X). If ‚Äúsynthetic shares‚Äù were a real phenomenon, you wouldn‚Äôt have to go digging through this many foreign small-cap biomed companies to find any information about it. And before anyone chimes in, snthetic call options and put options *are* real, but those are **very** different from what OP is claiming.

**Claim #4: Hedge funds are totally getting squeezed by GME‚Äôs rise!**

People who make this claim often resort to proving it by:

* using complex calculations

* depend on incomplete data

* make suppositions

* discard any data that disproves their claims

[Source ‚Äî 600 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/)

However, we don‚Äôt need to do any logical loop-de-loops to prove that GMe doesn‚Äôt have an exceptionally high level of short interest. In fact, all we have to do is go to [an old fan favorite of WSB](https://isthesqueezesquoze.com/) to see the true story laid out for us in a very clear, concise argument.

Here, we have a few important metrics:

*Short interest ‚Äî 16% ‚Äî the amount of shares short as a percentage of the float ‚Äî while 16% is atypically high, it‚Äôs nowhere *near* the purported 100-350% [some suspicious people](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/) with one-month old accounts are shilling.

* Borrow rate ‚Äî 0.6% ‚Äî particularly low. Borrow rates ‚Äî that is, the rate people are paid to lend out the stock on a yearly basis ‚Äî go up a lot the more a stock is shorted. For reference, RKT was at 20% a few weeks ago.

* Borrow availability ‚Äî 300,000 shares ‚Äî the most heavily shorted stocks often appear as ‚Äúno shares available for shorting‚Äù for a long time ‚Äî *days, even* ‚Äî since their shares are so in demand to borrow and sell short.

So there you have it. Three very simple, easy metrics you can use to verify that the stock is not as heavily shorted as some people want you to believe. To believe otherwise would mean you would have to buy in to conspiracies about a wide-ranging collaboration between various market participants and entities with differing aims, ethics, and stakes, involving thousands of people, and all to cover up the true short rate of just *one* stock. [Occam‚Äôs Razor, y‚Äôall](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

**Conclusion**

Now you have to ask yourself ‚Äî do you like the *stock* or do you like the *hype*? Because if it‚Äôs the former, then you should not be supporting the people continually spreading disinformation about it. If it‚Äôs the latter, then have fun on this wild ride, but don‚Äôt lie or support lying to your fellow WSBers.

17tyu8u,2023-11-13 00:58:28,Why this is the start of a 10 year bull run unlike we've ever seen before.,"History that is forgotten is history that will repeat itself. As some of you may know, the powers that be have been on a self-righteous moral crusade around the world. Ireland is putting warning labels on beer. In Australia it is illegal for adults to buy vaping products, Canada has sugar sweetened beverage tax.. you get my drift. Adults are not allowed to do adult stuff, and mark my words if history is anything to look at, next stop is undoubtedly prohibition.

Now I'm not here to argue what people should and shouldn't be allowed to do, I'm here to give the most important DD you'll hear in your lifetime, and I'll keep it so simple a bag holding meme stonk ape would understand. So now that we're on the topic of history, when did the prohibition of alcohol come into play? **January 17, 1920**. If you are not aware throughout the 1920's a long boom took stock prices to peaks never before seen. Why? Because they made everything fun **ILLEGAL.**

People need an outlet as we're all just animals in the end of the day, the same way a lemur sucks on a poison millipede for a high and a dolphin passes the blowfish bong around to its flipper buddies **WE NEED AN ESCAPE TOO**. People were so bored that the only thing they could do is fucking gamble on horse and cart stocks, it's actually illegal to make the stock market illegal in capitalism, look it up. So everyone went balls deep on fd's 20's style and shit only went up.

It was only a full 9 years later when they had the biggest stock market crash ever seen. The great depression of **1929**. With the last remaining outlet for degeneracy gone; the stock market, people turned to crime, and like clockwork they began to unwind the laws that made this mess in the first place. Prohibition ended December 5, 1933.

l6eym0,2021-01-27 21:35:03,"AMC is the new GME: cousins, not competitors, AMC is the next big short squeeze, and outperformed GME today by 165% with a price still under $20","AMC is the new GME, with better fundamentals and outlook. Before you autists get all frothy at me, I'm not telling anyone to give up their üíéüôå. The beauty of stocks is that you can own more than one.

AMC opened today at 4x the price, after trending up for days. It bounced around half its ATH of $35, before closing at 300% gain for the day.

GME hit $380 today, up six times its all time high of $63. The current GME price scares away non-autist retail investors, and at that price, new buyers will be expending multiples more capital for the same upward pressure.

If you don't believe me, look at the numbers. As GME is hitting mainstream and is the big hotness on this sub, AMC also outperformed GME by 165% by close today.

Also, #saveAMC is already trending as it gains traction across social media. People are actively looking for a new GME they feel they missed the boat on.

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-shares-outerspace

https://twitter.com/reddittrading/status/1354479260363354117

Despite how low the price already was, it has a record number of shorts: over 38 million. This means another short squeeze isn't just on the menu - it's already starting. It's the third most shorted stock out there, despite its clearly viable future. This doesn't distract from GME's slaughter of hedge funds because it's the next wave of their an hero.

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/

https://highshortinterest.com/

AMC has raised a billion dollars to weather out coronavirus, amid an ongoing ""Safe & Clean"" push. Some studios like WB are moving to parallel releases on HBO Max, but AMC is already throwing out deals to get people in the door. Meanwhile, Hollywood has been sitting on blockbusters after watching Tenet and WW1984 eat shit on streaming:

https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean

https://screenrant.com/tenet-box-office-failure-warner-bros-2021-movies-impact/

Their debt/equity ratio has also been trending positively, even as coronavirus has intensified. Just a return to the mean suggests ridiculous gain, even ignoring the likelihood of pent-up demand. AMC has legs not just for the next week, but for the next few quarters.

https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMC/amc-entertainment-holdings/debt-equity-ratio

Coronavirus, the main cause for AMC's big downturn, is on the way out as vaccines will be available to all by spring, just ahead of summer blockbuster season.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-biden-anyone-spring/

In the long term, after hedge fund shorters lose their ass on GME, brick and mortar game stores will have less of a future, with or without coronavirus. It's easier to digitally download games, and hardware can be bought online and received the next day from any number of retailers. There's no way to mount a 20 foot screen in your house. Unless, of course, you buy AMC stock now.

vkvbat,2022-06-26 03:17:43,Why are gas prices increasing? What if I told you it has little to do with the price of oil? Let me elaborate.,"We've been told countless of times, gas prices are increasing because of the ""Putin Price Hike"" or "" It's the Greedy Oil Companies"". I don't know about you, but I for one try my best to not blindly trust claims but rather verify claims. Here's what's really going on.

It's the government stupid.

(Chart: U.S. All Grades All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices)

This graph shows you the weekly gas prices. Notice how before 2004 the price of gas was fairly stable. Then gas hit a national average of $4.11 (All time high) in 2008 before ultimately crashing. It's been averaging down ever since, until ‚Ä¶ November 2020. Anyone want to guess what happened? That's right, Biden was elected President.

(Crude Oil Prices 70-Year Historical Chart)

This Graph represents the price of oil. Notice how oil is significantly less then it was in 2008, but yet gas is at an all time high at $5.80 (National Average) why is that? You understand why the argument of ""high gas prices is purely a result of of high oil prices"" would be false, right?

The other argument we hear often is ""Big Oil Companies Are Being Greedy"". Let me show you why that's not the case.

Most of us understand business operate under margins, if they have added costs guess what ‚Ä¶ They're not paying it, you are. You've probably heard of a term called "" Demand Pull"" but have you heard of the term "" Cost Push""?

[https://www.foxbusiness.com/energy/timeline-biden-actions-oil-gas-priorities](https://www.foxbusiness.com/energy/timeline-biden-actions-oil-gas-priorities)

(A Timeline of Biden's Actions on Oil And Gas)

**January 20, 2021** : Biden‚Äôs first actions was to¬†revoke approval for the Keystone XL, and impose a moratorium on oil and gas leasing federal lands and waters . Roughly 25% of U.S. production comes from federal areas.

Regulation & you've just eliminated 25% of the U.S supply. Does anyone know how supply and demand works? Did he stop there? Of course not!

**February 26, 2021:** Biden updates the ""social cost of greenhouse gas emissions,"" dramatically altering the way the U.S. government calculates the real-world costs of climate change. The administration plans boost the figure it will use to assess greenhouse gas pollution's damage inflicts on society to $51 per ton of carbon dioxide (**Seven times higher**) . This would apply to any new oil and gas lease sale, raising producers‚Äô costs to deliver new supplies.

Another Tax expense on something that can't even be measured  
accurately, $51 per ton (7X Higher) who pays for it? You! Cost push, you thin I'm done? I've only started.

**June 1, 2021:** Eliminating a slew of tax benefits for oil, gas and coal producers. Eliminating these tax provisions imperils U.S. energy security by raising costs for domestic producers and would increase America‚Äôs reliance on foreign energy supplies.

Ohh so you removed tax benefits issued by the previous administration, sounds like an added cost. Who pays? You!

**August 11, 2021:**¬†Biden calls on OPEC+ producers to increase supply to help curb rising oil prices, even though the U.S. is one of the three largest producers in the world and can deliver supply with a lower carbon footprint

We're the top producer of oil in the entire world, yet we've become dependent on countries like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia . Not only can we supply ourselves with oil but we could do it with less carbon foot print then the rest of the world.

( The Biden administration has set new requirements that increase the amount of ethanol that must be blended into the nation‚Äôs gasoline supply.)

If all this wasn't bad enough now we have people who produce nothing (Politicians) telling the private sector how to produce oil. They want to increase the use of ethanol in gas.

I'll make the argument on why ethanol is a horrible idea in bullet points.

* 95% of ethanol is produced from corn , we have a major corn shortage. This will worsen the already bad food supply.
* Expect increase use in fertilizer also experiencing a major shortage .
* Ethanol can be extremely damaging to engines and high-powered sports equipment, leading to corrosion of the engine and fuel system.

(Biden warns Big Oil over gas output)

""President Biden will warn CEOs of the nation's largest oil companies on Wednesday that he's considering invoking emergency powers ""

""Prepared to use all reasonable and appropriate Federal Government tools and emergency authorities to increase refinery capacity and output in the near term.""

This scared me completely because it sounds like his administration would like to nationalize the oil industry, and we've seen what happened to Venezuela.

uqlki1,2022-05-16 02:28:01,Avoid any stock with China influence or roots. Also prepare for a bear market for a while.,"Sup boys, been taking a break waiting on the crash since Trump miracled 7 trillion into the market.

I thought when Biden got in it would collapse but it looks like it took 2 years.

I dont think we're done though.  Heres why.

China imminent collapse.

War in Russia.  Nato escalations. 

World wide shortages. 

 Cryptocurreny collapse.

Let me start with üá®üá≥ 

Chinas economy has run rampant for the last 20 years.  The United States borrows trillions from China.  However, China is in a deeper bubble than we have ever seen.  

Chinas main source of economy is in real estate.   Do you know there are abaondoned sky scrapers in China right now?  Its like detroit had a baby with dubai.  They built a city for 10 million people and cant even get 100,000 to buy the properties. The banks print out real estate loans more than Jpow is printing out singles.

This happened in dubai as well, I'm not sure on current affairs but i remember all the sports cars like Ferrari and Mclarens left abandoned in parking lots and the desert after they defaulted and left country before they got their heads chopped off. (Serious arab law)

Today you can explore abandoned high rises in china, some half constructed abandoned.

In 2021 Q4 484 chinese businesses defaulted on their major real estate payments. (This should be double digits)

On top of all of this, covid has run absolutely rampant to the point they are locking people in üçé factories and can't leave.  This may be what pops the bubble but I would not put a nickel of my burger king check into any China owned companies. Have you all tried to buy a car lately?  You cant.  China and all of the nafta companies aren't producing near enough goods.  If you can't sell you cant make tendies.

If and when the bubble burst it will shake up an already rattled global economy with the üá∫üá¶ war.   I think this year possibly next the united states will enter into the war. 

Already ships like the USS Kearsarge are in route to the Baltic Sea arrived 24hours ago

I would guess a 5-10 trillion dollar loss on NASDAQ overnight is possible could be this year if announce of the war, I'm sure it will start with a russian attack that hits american troops, a plane or an embassy.  The moment this happens (it will) you need to start shorting before the boomers pull out of their 401k.  

If you already havent pulled out of your 401k consider it, transfer it to a roth ira or something like S&P500 on td ameriteade thats setup for retirement where you can pull out quickly. 

On top of that the ticking time bomb of China we got a goold old great depression cooking.  

Anyways boys

1a. SQR ((15)(1.5)(.1)(0.2939)) = 0.81 (actual value per share)

2. P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

2a. ((16.70)(0.1)) = 1.67 (intrinsic value)

&#x200B;

This means the actual *value* of the stock is *Drumroll Please...*

Between  $0.81 - $1.67

&#x200B;

If my math is correct (and it probably isn't), then this means that Deutsche Bank's stock is MASSIVELY overvalued and is due for a market correction (hence the AMAZING shorting opportunity). Also, if I am wrong please correct me - I only would like to learn more about the market, so I can eventually lose $5,000,000 in an earnings call.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Current Price = 10.12

&#x200B;

I do not want to mess up the momentum of $GME or $AMC, I am only posting this because in the same way that we LIKE those stocks, I think we should also be open to DISLIKING some of the worst stocks on the market. Especially stocks with ties to CNBC and the other hedge fund assholes who have enslaved us with debt.

178sdll,2023-10-15 23:39:37,Snapchat (SNAP) Undervalued?,"Snapchat has fallen significantly from its ATH of $83 in Sept 2021 to $8.7 in Oct 2023 without any significant bounce.  
I believe the stock is unfairly valued, especially for the long term. Let's look at why.

  
The Good.  
\- If you are a Snapchat user you know how sticky the platform can be. A lot of your memories, clips, and key moments are stored directly on Snapchats servers. This greatly reduces the chances of people switching the app altogether. Another observation of this that I've increasingly noticed around me is that people open the Snapchat app by default as a camera. This along with its streak concept, keeps people hooked and unwilling to get rid of the app especially if they have a group of friends on them too. And new users every year will only create a snowball effect.

\- Instagram, Snaps biggest competitor has slowly evolved into a very commercial product where people mindlessly scroll through random content. The edge that Snapchat has here is that it has a far more personal experience among its users. 

\- Continuous innovation is also another huge plus in my book as they are very quick to adapt and introduce new features in their platform, such as the AI bot, which it adapted very quickly upon chatgpts release. Plus they have been working on VR and AR for a long time, and are very good at it too. Hence we can comfortably say they are continuously innovating and the future could be very bright for them.

\- The price for Snapchat if you believe in it long term is very attractive at these prices. These low prices have not been seen since Feb of 2019. And the platform has significantly matured since then. 

\- Increasing revenue.

\- Great risk to reward ratio for long term investors, and for short term investors a swing trade to $25 is likely. 

The Bad.  
\- They haven't been making a profit and having a hard time monetizing their platform. But I think this problem will sooner or later be resolved.

\- There may still be room for the stock to fall. Even though the price looks like it has found a floor, the ATL is still -40% away from the current price.

That's about it. I hope I could shed some light on SNAP and why I'm betting on their future success.",1,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/178sdll/snapchat_snap_undervalued/,wallstreetbets
l98q6y,2021-01-31 09:07:49,Citadel bought GME?!?!,"So as everyone knows, the Hedge Fund with the biggest short position on GME is Melvin Capital.  As we also know, Melvin got an emergency cash infusion of $2.75 billion last Monday from Citadel and Point72 to help them with their GME shorts. 

On a post the other day someone sent the following helpful [link with positions hedge funds have](https://hedgefollow.com/stocks/GME).  Did a search for GME and at the bottom of the Top 20 hedge funds that own GME is Citadel With 111.8k shares which is only .01% of their portfolio.  It says their position is new but believe this list is as of Q4 2020.  This is confusing me as this position contradicts their support of Melvin which may be going bankrupt if we have our way.  Unless they are holding to hedge the support of Citadel?   Any thoughts on this?  I want to see both Melvin and Citadel go bankrupt and hate to see one of them profit off GME mooning.

Does anyone have an updated list of hedge fund positions or a list of what stocks hedge funds are shorting?

TLDR, Why does Citadel have a long position in GME?  I don‚Äôt want to see them make a dime off of GME mooning.

What I found is actually super interesting, to me anyways. But dont forget, past performance does not equal future performance and this is all just speculative, but then again banks and people do have patterns, so if it is as highly manipulated as they say it is, maybe this is something. Anyways heres my retard document I spent far too long on.

https://imgur.com/gallery/gA6gbZP

So bassically we have a batman pattern in 2008 and were curently on the right ear of a batman patern right now. Whats interesting is the VW infinity squeeze happened in October 08, just to the right of batmans ear. We are currently in the middle of a GME infinity squeeze, and are currently, on batmans right ear. The difference is what side of batman the crashes are, in 2008 the crash is to the right of batman, in 2020 the crash is to the left of batman. So that kills the pattern right? Wrong, in 2008 The fed didnt start the quantiative easing until 3 months after lehman brothers went bankrupt and the worst that could happen, happenned. In 2020 the fed Started QE as soon as possible, thus the reversed sides of batman make complete sense.

With all this said, this could mean that SLV will finish it's batman ear and the gme squeeze will crash SLV and then a recovery to ATH, it could mean that because of the reversed crash patterns SLV will start climbing to ATH without finishing batmans ear, or, the most likely scenario, this means absolutely nothing and I just wasted a couple hours of my weekend.

EDIT: I think I should clear this up, I'm not advocating to dump gme and buy slv. SLV wont start rising to ATH until after the GME infinity squeeze. We need it to happen

**The AMC dividend gives AMC the ability to dilute up to 450 % after ex-div date of APE token without seeking any shareholder approval.** 

**Ape token has same voting rights as AMC common stock on allowing conversion from APE to AMC -> you own majority of shares in AMC+APE through either ticker you control AMC.**

**Stock is not down 80 % yet so this shit is gonna come down hard soon (I give it a month max NFA). Easy short, puts into and after ex dividend date = free money (???). Bulls r insanely fk.**

Positions: 12 puts in range 19-22 for september monthly expiry initially. Will scale into more degen bets in the coming weeks. I am not early, but others are seemingly stupid giving us the chance to grab puts on the cheap after news which should have tanked the stock price

&#x200B;

  
POST BEGIN: 

As most of us know AMC had earnings on thursday after hours. It was a sought after earnings as AA had been hinting to something big happening, a ‚Äúpounce‚Äù some might say. What this proved to be was a Preferred stock dividend with the ticker $APE (lol). Most people were let down by this, some were excited, but if you look under the hood it is insane how the AMC stock price as of today ended the day up over 18 % and you might think how the fuck did that happen? Earnings sucked balls!  AMC had a shitton of [FTDs due](https://stocksera.pythonanywhere.com/ticker/failure_to_deliver/?quote=AMC) this week as can be seen below, but thats not important.

&#x200B;

[AMC Failure to delivers due last week](https://preview.redd.it/mxehqxv44ag91.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1bcb882183c29e836484ba4db7642f1de9364af)

Last year AMC sought shareholder approval for an issuance of an additional 25 million shares to raise cash, but shareholders dissapproved of this as the apes had gotten tired of getting diluted. With AMCs current cash burn rate and their deferred rent payments at the time they did not have a lot of runway left before an inevitable bankruptcy unless they drastically improved their business. The most recent quarter AMC posted a loss to the tune of 121.6 million $, no share dilution approved still, but in comes AA with ‚Äúthe pounce‚Äù.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h3j29n094ag91.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=59d214161b1c4ad120a9bd5cc0628cae63403045

What this pounce actually turned out to be was a big middle finger to all the investors who disapproved of their requested 25 million share dilution last year. He did not only find a way to get this dilution without shareholder approval. He did not double down, not quadruple down but 100x double down by issuing a new stock which have the exact same voting rights as AMC common stock on the conversion from APE to AMC (lol).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i2nsjn4b4ag91.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=036c24175ab6380e1f0217c858fe7eb1eb7b6eed

This new ticker which we all know as $APE will give AA and the C-suite the ability to dilute it up to 4.5 billion shares after it has started trading on the NYSE. AA says black on white this was his plan B if investors didnt approve of a dilution (He always finds a way to dilute ;) )

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c9rqlw1c4ag91.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=b85d3ade469cfc0f2a1962658407c7b640416510

He is also no stranger to dilution. Through the late parts of 2021 and first half of 2021 he diluted like his life depended on it as we see in the image below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9wynx9sd4ag91.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3b7471f7e02b022634b519182b862a4e2e456a1

Some might say ‚Äúbut the APE dilution doesn‚Äôt matter as AMC wont be diluted so my shares should retain their value‚Äù. This is wrong because the $APE shares have literally all the properties AMC have when it comes to the vote for conversion. The ""vote for conversion"" if passed would make it so that one share of APE will be convertable into 1 common share of AMC. And if that vote passes 1 share of ape is identical to 1 share of AMC. You control majority vote through either APE or AMC you control the company. Its literally the same stock, but a different ticker.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z3h50dgf4ag91.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=06d5ee53885fe28a6b00ec2b1d4288965ac33820

In the relevant SEC filing on page 2 we find the following: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2cz2w0fj4ag91.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=a74fc0cded085ec7ac68a708ad3544b83e5e95a8

From the same document we have black on white that they can dilute the APE token without seeking any shareholder approval

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jm8gbgbm4ag91.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=120d056291fab55c9b7bf9a9ac3142778d7398d2

 So both preferred stock units and common shares get the same voting power and can vote on the common stock amendment. AA can dilute the preferred stock by up to 4.5 billion shares. Assuming retail owns the entire float of AMC (this is not true) that means they will have to buy up after full dilution a minimum of 1.739 billion APE tokens from all dilutions to exclude any chance of being outvoted by any others on the conversion vote from $APE to $AMC common stock. Retail simply does not have that capital, and to be frank they do not own the float on AMC. Last shareholders meeting had a total of 268,775,910 voters as can be seen in the relevant SEC filing.

 What‚Äôs even more funny is now during the weekend Adam Aron himself is admitting its a dilution on twitter and is floundering around trying to ‚Äúcalm‚Äù his investors stating this is \*\*Good diluton\*\* and not bad dilution.

lu5o0u,2021-02-28 04:15:33,How you're ACTUALLY getting fucked,"Judging from the average post and comment on here, most of you correctly suspect that the financial service industry and financial regulations have generally fucked you over, but you then seem to think that every possible way you might get fucked, no matter how far fetched, is actually true.

I'm here to tell you that a broker doesn't try to trade against you when you execute a trade, the Fed doesn't directly lend money to hedge funds to short, short ladder attacks don't exist, that naked shorting is not happening, and hedge funds generally underperform the market so they're just as stupid as anyone else.

1. Brokers find counterparties to trade with through market makers. They do not want to take the risk of being a counterparty to your trade, because they have no idea whether you are informed are not. They earn money through fees and in the case of RH, by selling order flow and by having poorer execution than most brokers.
2. The Fed lends money to banks through the discount window. Yes, it is true that the most recent quantitative easing has benefited asset prices but not the economy, so it's been a bust from a social welfare standpoint and has basically been a net transfer of wealth from people who are newly saving to the already wealthy. (The first QE in 2008 and 2009 may have been necessary, but that's a more complex story.)
3. Short ladder attacks just don't exist. I don't know what else to say about this one.
4. Shorting goes above 100% of shares outstanding in the following way: a share is lent to be shorted and sold short and the investor who buys that shorted share lends it out again to be shorted. In theory this could go on arbitrarily high. It's fine to want a regulation that limits the amount of shorting as a percentage of shares outstanding. I think this is sensible and would mitigate volatility but there's no naked shorting going on.
5. [Hedge funds have been underperforming](https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/study-sheds-light-on-why-hedge-funds-are-struggling/) by 0.8% per annum on a risk-adjusted basis since 2009.

How are you actually being screwed?

1. While there is not direct regulatory capture of the Federal Reserve, numerous economists that work for the Reserve have thoughts of potentially getting high paying Wall Street jobs. They almost never want to write a paper that just shits all over banks. This and the fact that they speak to banks but do not speak to us directly means that their policies lean towards helping banks. This is isn't some weird backroom moustache twirling bullshit that seems to be pushed around. Unfortunately, it's a bit worse, since it's an endemic cultural problem with incentives that are hard to untangle.
2. High frequency trading firms / market makers like Citadel, Jane Street, and Renaissance Medallion Fund earn their alpha in the most volatile periods for two reasons: they earn wide bid-ask spreads and the market is highly predictable on a short term basis during those periods, so they're effectively front-running the herd that is leaving or entering a position.
3. Less of a problem in WSB, but mutual fund companies launch tons of funds and only market the ones that do well obviously. They rely on survivorship bias and luck to drive assets. They make different bets in different funds and they'll certainly have a winner somewhere.
4. Brokers try to convince you that you can beat the market. The average retail investor does not beat the market. They are the counterparty to the institutional investor who does beat the market.

How do you avoid being screwed? However boring it is, if you buy and hold a global stock ETF, no one can ever fuck with you. It barely trades.

Everyone SEEMS to be super self-aware of their own intellectual shortcomings (let's call it) but ironically, people then state utter nonsense with supreme confidence and everyone pats them on the back for being correct and ""in the know."" (""This guy still thinks that there are two political parties in the United States. Don't you know the parties are owned by the same corporate interests?"" Wow. So insightful and edgy, even though the two parties agree on almost nothing.) It's not that hard to nab a job of some sort at a large asset manager, and the pay isn't bad either. See how it actually is. It's far more mundane and when there's evil, it's banal evil--shutting down the underperforming fund and only mentioning the outperforming ones to prospective clients or trying to explain away bad performance in overly technical terms hoping that your clients think you're smart and don't fire you.

The industry needs to change desperately. It sucks away talent to do useless bullshit. It often acts as a net transfer of wealth from investor to asset manager. But it's not what you guys think it is at all.

I may have autism but I‚Äôm not retarded. Do you really think seeing GME at $1,000 will inevitably mean it will go to $2,000 or $5,000 or $6,900? Who controls the game? Hint: IT IS NOT YOU.

If we can cause a default in the paper silver market or a runaway silver price as paper markets scramble to buy up physical silver that doesnt exist, it would have a much greater impact than taking down a couple of hedge funds. The COMEX and LBMA have been manipulating the price of gold and silver for decades by printing paper contracts while they have nothing in their vaults, it's time they paid the price.

12k2y3g,2023-04-12 23:02:39,Get Fucked Bulls,"Hold the line bears! Bulls are out of steam, and this is where all the gains come from as a gay bear. When the bulls are at max confidence and the rug gets pulled.

Let‚Äôs review‚Ä¶

Remember the SPCE news when the flew their shit flight? Rumor was bought, news was sold.

Remember when Elon went on SNL and pumped Doge? Rumor was bought, news was sold.

Remember October lows: we all knew it was going to be hot CPI. It can‚Äôt get worse than this. Rumor was sold, bad news was bought.

Remember earlier this week, and last week, when people expected inflation to cool going into this CPI print? Rumor was bought, news was sold. 

Remember how the bulls say it‚Äôs ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù and they are pricing in a fed pivot? The rumor of cooler inflation, the reason for a pivot, was realized today, we sold off. Why? Why did rate expectations go up?

Remember that energy deflation was the number one driver of overall disinflation? Remember how there wasn‚Äôt any rumor for OPEC cut? It surprised everyone and oil was bought immediately. Remember how energy prices underpin all economic activity - and that Biden already blew the SPR?

Remember how the bulls just put together an epic 2 quarter rally from October to today, with rising rates, collapsing banks, and a shit economic outlook? Remember how they bought the dip, deployed their bonuses, deployed their tax returns and are all sitting on unrealized gains?

Remember now that capital was deployed, and is still deployed, on the rumor of a fed pivot and a soft landing? On the rumor of ‚Äúthis time it‚Äôs different‚Äù? Remember how people are using 0DTE or margin to go all in on FRC shares?

Remember how retail always moves last and the wealth transfer only works when retail deployed leveraged capital at the top - only to be liquidated on the way down - so smart money can deploy leverage capital at the bottom. 

Remember that Powell has delivered on his dot plot, and on expectations, at every meeting. Remember that ‚Äúno one sees rate cuts for the rest of the year‚Äù is what the man said.

Remember money supply is tightening and banks are essentially all zombies at this point. All of them owe their existence to the feds special facility - they do what the fed wants - the fed wants inflation down unemployment up.

Remember that unemployment might be hard to move, a lot of dead old people, no real immigration, no cheap labor. Remember pow doesn‚Äôt control unemployment, just the cost of money - so how much HIGHER does the dial need to go until we see 4 percent unemployment?

Remember the money supply has never slowed this fast, to this degree, and remember US runs on credit. No credit? No growth, no more EPS no more multiple expansion.

Remember, policy acts with a lag - nothing has happened yet in the real economy besides some minimal layoffs, SPACs died, and SVB died. A blip on the radar - the impact has been meaningless thus far.

Remember, the smartest of retail will take their gains. Bearish. The dumbest of retail will buy the dip again, with leverage, just loading up positions on the wrong side of the boat. This makes the liquidation on the way down even more violent. Bearish.


Remember that stocks need a reason to go up: buyers > sellers. Remember that bulls need to manufacture that reason (money, greed, innovation, cheap capital, no alternative). Is there more ammo left? Are the call buyers and leveraged longs going to reload tomorrow? Or are they feeling a little unsure now that they got exactly what they wanted?

Fear and greed drive the market.

It‚Äôs obvious what was driving the past 6 months of price action: greed.

Are we all still feeling greedy‚Ä¶ or maybe‚Ä¶ we are afraid of losing those gains?

m6u2km,2021-03-17 06:33:23,Why UWMC is no match for RKT in the long term,"First, I'm not talking about any squeeze potential, which can happen to either/both stocks. I'm interested in the business models of these companies.

**Intro**

I think many people are familiar with the RKT/UWMC feud after the RKT squeeze put both in the spot light. UWMC issued an ultimatum to mortgage brokers to stop working with other companies, which supposedly 90% of their existing broker partners agreed to. Many people here and on other subreddits are invested, and claiming each of these companies are significantly undervalued. I just want to put things into perspective from the business model side and future outlook side. 

**Business Model - direct lending and broker lending**

First, let's talk about their business models. RKT is fairly diversified a number of lending businesses, with their TPO division for brokers but majority of their mortgage lending business direct to consumer. On the other hand, UWMC only deal with mortgage brokers, who make their cut between the lender and consumer. 

In general, consumers with good credit and who has long standing existing banking relations with a bank or credit union will go there first. They may compare a few lenders to get the best rate, but generally working with lenders directly, especially if they know someone in the business. Only when you have a special circumstance on your credit history/rating or when you can't get a satisfactory loan directly from your local lenders, then your realtor may suggest going to a broker. Brokers make money because they may be able to get you a loan that otherwise you may not (or shouldn't) qualify for. This actually contributed a lot to the mortgage default crisis in 08. 

When I bought my first house I had a special circumstance for my loan application and couldn't get the loan size that I wanted with lenders, and my realtor suggested we can go find brokers who can find high interest rate loans of that size, some of them even from private lenders. Luckily we were able to find a credit union that could work with us. But you get the gist - mortgage brokers sometimes work with (and sometimes prey on) people with low credit who can't loans directly from lenders, and this is what they get paid for. Not all brokers are bad, but there is definitely a ""car salesman"" feeling from them. In the end, I would think the loans that brokers push through are in general more risky than direct to consumer loans. I don't work in the business but people who do could find some statistics. When rates starts to rise, and also after the mortgage moratorium end, the first to default will be these higher interest rate loans from brokers. I think RKT is positioned better than UWMC in a higher interest rate environment.

**Innovation and growth**

This will go hand in hand with the valuation section below. Brokers, no matter what they are brokering, are a thing of the past. With information and technology, the trend is definitely for individuals to browse and pick on their own. This is not to say everything should be automated. Especially for a big purchase like a house, professional help is needed and this is why realtors still have a job even with the rise of Zillow and Redfin etc. But professional help is really only need for getting legal things done and for things that requires tacit skills like negotiating prices on an offer. Mortgage requirements are for the most part set in stone and rates are mostly non-negotiable. So what is the job of the broker? They just aggregate information for you, which technology is poised to do just as well, if not better. Technology also brings transparency so everyone's competing on a level field; you don't need to ""know a guy"" to get your loan at the best rates for your situation. This kind of no frills experience is the new way of doing business and led to the rise of Zillow, Carmax, lemonade, etc. RKT is trying to do that and this is what will transform the mortgage industry, not someone like UWMC, who is just trying to squeeze both the brokers and consumers to get more profits in the short term and stay alive.

**valuation** 

A lot of people are talking of each companies valuations relative to many metrics like sales and earnings. You cannot compare these ratios to the tech and meme growth stocks that we are all so familiar with. Just go to finviz and put in P/S under 4 and see how many companies show up. If a company doesn't have high margins and/or potential for exponential growth, they will not and should not carry a huge P/S ratio. For UWMC, I don't see any way this company can grow very fast or innovate, especially given their hostile attitude towards their own broker partners. For RKT it's harder to say whether their technologies like the mostly automatic underwriting process, and also their attempt to have good UI and customer service, is enough to be deserving of a high valuation. But at least I do see them transforming the traditional mortgage business and I think they stand a high chance of maintaining their rapid growth as more tech-savvy people start to purchase homes.

**Summary**

Don't just buy into UWMC because they spiked later than RKT and they ""seem like an undervalued"" stock. A quick look at the different approaches of these two companies clearly reveals who is the innovative ""sleeping giant"" and who is the boomer stock. While both may be good speculative short term plays, if you are serious long term investor I would take a long and hard at these companies.

Prior to the first GME run. There was not a single DD on AMC apart from the rumor it might get buy out by Amazon which never happened. FUCKING NONE.

You need to wake the fuck up and look at both side of the stories. 

1.Wanda group is the largest stakeholder of AMC. All companies in China basically make money for the Communist party. Yes I fucking know it has its advantages but it will NEVER benefit you. 

As soon as AMC got included in the meme stocks and got a boost, they selling their shares at double digits leaving you holding the bag. Did GME do that?

2. Fundamentals. Did you guys know about rating agencies?

THEY BASICALLY DO DD FOR YOU EVERY 6MONTHS AND TELL YOU HOW DANGEROUS AN INVESTMENT CAN BE.

AMC credit rating is at CC,FUCKING DOUBLE C not even CCC. It's so trash it has to sell 200m shares at $2.8 in December to pay off their debt,  now you all want in at fucking $8? Meanwhile GME got upgraded to B3(B-) during the fucking pandemic.

10ldjx7,2023-01-25 23:44:58,"$TSLA is not a buy, it's a HOLD at best and a SELL imo. Here is why.","We got the Tesla earnings and Papa Elon cult is back at it with their ""bers r fuk"" posts. 


I know we're all regarded here but just try looking into TSLA's actual Q4 earnings package. 


Firstly it tells you everything you need to know about Tesla the company. It's all about marketing. That's the only thing Elon is good at... well mostly. 


Numbers that matter are at the very end of the report after 8 pages of photos for you crayon eating monkeys. 


TESLA IS AN AUTO MANUFACTURER! Even in their comparison charts that's what they compare themselves to. But what they don't compare is apples to apples. Automotive gross margin of Tesla is on a decline after a year where they had the highest prices before they had to cut prices at the end of 22 and beginning of this year. 


With lower prices, their margin is going to drop even more. Now add a slowdown in economy to the mix where they will have lower demand, Tesla has probably just posted their best earnings for the next 4-6 quarters. 


This is probably peak Tesla in this cycle. Now let's look at their cashflows. Tesla claims to have enough cash to get through the hard times. This quarter alone, they have used up 15% of their cash from end of Q3. 


Tesla also has an increase in inventory which is not huge but not a great sign. If everything is going so great, we need to see the opposite. 


TL:DR This is a warning post for those of you who think Tesla has dropped ""enough."" When you compare it with other auto manufacturers you see the disconnect. Sooner or later TSLA will be valued just like other auto manufacturers. With limited growth while burning through cash, TSLA is a hold at best and a sell IMO.",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10ldjx7/tsla_is_not_a_buy_its_a_hold_at_best_and_a_sell/,wallstreetbets

1cw9mkc,2024-05-20 07:19:48,"The death of the Iranian president was just confirmed, here's how you could benefit from it.","The death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi introduces significant challenges, given his administration's stringent policies, aggressive foreign stance, and ongoing economic sanctions. This event could worsen internal power struggles and social unrest, similar to past protests. Additionally, Iran's relations with the West, particularly concerning the nuclear deal (JCPOA), might become more strained, potentially stalling sanctions relief and impacting the fragile economy.

Market Implications:

Energy Sector

Iran is a major player in the global oil market. Any instability within the country could lead to concerns about oil supply disruptions, which typically result in increased oil prices. Companies like ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) could see significant movement as oil prices respond to the news. Additionally, WTI Crude Oil futures might experience heightened volatility.

Defense and Security Stocks

Geopolitical uncertainty often leads to increased defense spending, particularly in regions close to the epicenter of the instability. Companies such as Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) could benefit from this increased demand. These firms provide advanced military technology and defense systems that are likely to see higher orders from both the U.S. and its allies in the Middle East.

Middle Eastern Markets

Regional markets, especially in countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, could experience increased volatility. The Tadawul (Saudi Stock Exchange) and the Dubai Financial Market might see fluctuating investor sentiment. ETFs that track these markets, such as the iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF (KSA), could be impacted by changes in regional stability and investor risk appetite.

Safe-Haven Assets

In times of geopolitical uncertainty, investors often flock to safe-haven assets. Gold, represented by SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), and U.S. government bonds are typical beneficiaries. Increased demand for these assets can drive up their prices, providing a hedge against the broader market volatility.",0,0.46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cw9mkc/the_death_of_the_iranian_president_was_just/,wallstreetbets
la74lm,2021-02-01 16:26:53,I think that the Silver hate is actually what they are looking for. Here me out before you nuke me.,"Preface: BUY GME DONT SELL HOLD AND FUCK CITADEL.

I am not preaching for people to buy into paper silver stocks. The criticism that the market is too big to be influenced is correct. There are way more paper silver shares in circulation than there is physical silver to back it up.   


I hope you all realize that the Hedgies understand that this sub will have an adverse reaction to anything they do to try and move people off of GME. They understand that promoting silver will get the reaction that it currently is: people saying that silver is a trick and to forget about it. 

Paper silver shares are not the move, obviously, but Silver still has the potential to be the next big move if we approach it correctly. EMPHASIS ON NEXT\* DO NOT SELL GME OR MOVE INTO THIS POSITION UNTIL THIS WAR IS OVER.

If people start buying physical silver and demanding delivery of their paper shares, it will result in devastation for the Hedgies and Big Banks. This is why they are pushing paper shares so hard to get WSBs to call off the dogs on silver all together. Don't underestimate your enemy, they understand what reactions their actions will get.   


Silver can be the bullet that pops the everything bubble, but it needs to be done in a specific way. If the tutes that are trading all these paper shares that represent far more silver than actually physically exists, then demanding delivery will force them to pay any price to get the material. If the retail market is buying up that physical stock before that happens, they are fucked,   


This is still the long play imo, but I have been in this space for many many years. It is a solid investment regardless of what the outcome is in terms of damage to the tutes. It could be the best next move in this war, but we will see. I am long silver, but I am a physical collector. I think the anti silver hype that has gained traction here is exactly what they are after.   


My suggestion is that we just ignore silver all together for now, but don't forget about it when the GME stage finally resolves. That is what they want. Let's win this GME short squeeze before we promote any other moves, but be extra vigilant of any moves they are making through their media cronies. They are learning what their actions result in, and they will use that to manipulate you away from the things they don't want you focusing on. I truly believe this is a fake out, and we are giving them the reaction they desire by killing any and all moves into the PM space.   


Thats just my opinion though. Do as you see fit. GME to Pluto. GG NO RE",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la74lm/i_think_that_the_silver_hate_is_actually_what/,wallstreetbets
o314nl,2021-06-18 21:49:01,Where was the AMC Squeeze?,"After 2 weeks of AMC hype videos filling up my YT recommendation lists, countless online ""analysts"" completely bullish on the impending ""gamma squeeze"" that was all but assured to hit on Friday 6/18.... today passed with not much difference than any other day.

It honestly feels like we're playing poker at a high stakes table with the Hedge Funds with our cards facing up and looking around the room like we're secretly the smartest guy at the table.

Is it time for us to truly snap back into reality and really look at what's going on here?  Let's be honest... the hedge funds have had weeks/months to learn from their GME mistakes.  Any call options that would have been out of the money today was probably already hedged against days/weeks ago.  Even if they let $40 and $50 OTM options expire today, they are probably recuperating their losses in profits elsewhere in their portfolio.  There may never come a situation where the AMC short squeeze will actually happen.  The gamma squeeze??  Well, that's already happened when it spiked from $10 to $72.  If that's not ""to the moon"", I'm not sure what is, especially for a stock that is 70% over-valued atm.

I understand that this is a ""movement"" and that it's ""ape/retailers vs the big funds"" but I'm also seeing alot of people here yolo their entire savings onto a meme stock.  Am I the only one who thinks that we're doing a complete disservice to the amateur investors here who do not really know what they are doing and \*actually\* thinking they are making wise investments?

At the end of the day, there is no reality where the big hedge funds will just sit & watch and roll-over while we squeeze AMC to $100+ and then tuck their tails between their legs and just swallow the losses without any strategic plan.  I think anyone who is still waiting and believing in this will be the ones left holding the bag.  The same people who held at $20 will be holding at $60, will still be holding even at $120 (if that ever comes) and one day, they will be left holding the bag regretting all of the chances they had to cash out for profit along the way.  Do these ""diamond hands"" actually have an exit plan?

As the old saying goes, it's not a loss until you sell.  But the inverse is also true.  It's never a gain if you hold forever either.  Am I missing something here or are we still all convinced that the hedge funds will stare down an oncoming semi-truck and just stand there like a deer in headlights while retailers rob them blind?

schq5a,2022-01-25 16:33:08,Apes ruined WSB as we know it,"Oh boy, here it goes

GME squeeze in its early stages was a fantastic event, plenty of people that were already on WSB entered positions at 5-10-20-40 dollars and rode to the top, exiting and realizing gains. It was a great event that became pretty popular, and unfortunately attracted 8 million other user, who knew fuck all about investing and just wanted to make a quick buck by sticking it to the hedgies. Problem with them was that they came in and acted like they were the next Warren Buffet, and anyone who disagreed with them was a dumb shill or didn‚Äôt understand the movement‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

Stock kept dropping further, going all the way down to $40 dollars, before other 8 million users realized that they were too late for an initial squeeze, and decided that the MOASS is yet to come.

What was initially a calculated plan in a company that was trading as it was already bankrupt became a platform of firing the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù and sticking it to the ‚Äúhedgies‚Äù

Conspiracy theories started spreading, goalposts were being moved, and anyone that disagreed was downvotes into oblivion. There were days when every single post on WSB was about GME. 

That‚Äôs fine, no harm in that, if it wasn‚Äôt for the mob mentality of literally calling anyone a shill. I was trying to make posts urging new traders to take profits, that trading is a 1 vs 1, not a team game, but my posts were either deleted or I was heavily downvoted.

I started learning about trading on WSB, browsing the sub in 2017. Back then I knew absolutely nothing about options, or trading. This sub was actually a great resource for learning from extremely smart people.
I know there is a stigma that everyone on WSB is retarded, however, back then it was actually smart people with six or seven digit portfolios just goofing around and making risky but **calculated** bets. 
Nowadays, it‚Äôs really just a competition in who is dumber and who can write the shittiest DD, than say not a financial advice at the end, and if someone challenges them, they‚Äôll just say ‚Äú sir this is Wendy‚Äôs‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a retard‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI eat crayons‚Äù. 

Thankfully over the past few months the amount of kids who thought they were some trading gurus for buying a tech stock in March 2020 decreased dramatically, apes moved to another sub that is now ripe with conspiracy theories and constant moving of goalposts. 

I just want to highlight one thing, people are tired of apes flooding this sub, this sub was never meant to be a GME circle jerk. But don‚Äôt take it from me, take it from ZJZ, a mod who has been with WSB for many years and kept it a sane place. Even he is tired of apes coming here and shilling a brick and mortar store that continues bleeding cash. 

https://i.imgur.com/oWnUhfT.jpg 

I want to be clear, not a single DD written by apes in the past 6 months has been correct, not one has materialized, and not one date they called led to MOASS. Frankly this sub needs more discussion and DD. You might say, dope, so write DD, be the change you want to see, and trust me I do to.

However, many times DD gets downvotes or you get called for being a shill for a stock that has any sort of cult following, be it WISH, AMC, GME, or any other popular stock.",371,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/schq5a/apes_ruined_wsb_as_we_know_it/,wallstreetbets

veqph0,2022-06-17 21:35:01,The Fed is making a big mistake,"The Fed just raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, the largest single rate hike since 1994. It's another step in the Fed's efforts to tackle the fastest inflation in 40 years.

&#x200B;

I understand the urgency of the Fed, but it has entered dangerous territory. If the Fed continues down this path - as it suggests - the economy will fall into recession. Every time the Fed has raised interest rates so fast over the past half century, it has led to a recession.

&#x200B;

Moreover, the rate hikes won't make up for the main reasons for current inflation -- two years of pent-up demand from the pandemic, shortages of goods and services, Putin's war in Ukraine, and large, profitable companies with enough pricing to use inflation as a cover to further The power to push up prices.

&#x200B;

The Fed assumes that price increases are being driven by wage growth ‚Äî so-called ‚Äúwage price inflation.‚Äù This is not correct. Wages lag behind inflation. A more accurate description of what we're seeing now might be called ""profit price inflation"" -- price increases driven by companies seeking to increase profits. (See chart below, from the Economic Policy Institute.)

&#x200B;

Recessions are especially detrimental to those most vulnerable to downturns‚Äîthe first to be laid off (and last to be rehired when the economy improves): low-wage workers, disproportionate women and people of color.

luxlbx,2021-03-01 02:28:46,Snack on the Sneakiest Short Squeeze of all time with UTZüöÄüöÄüöÄ,"I know what you‚Äôre thinking. A potato chip company, you gotta be kidding me. I also know you‚Äôre thinking another fucking short squeeze, but hear me out‚Ä¶ There is something VERY strange going on with this stock and I‚Äôm here to shed some light on it. 

Well listen here smooth brain because I‚Äôm not kidding and I would never fucking touch a company that moves as slowly as this stock unless I thought I could make a shitload of money. 

There is the sneakiest short squeeze of all time going on here and I‚Äôm ready to exploit it and apparently somebody else is too. 

So here it is, laid out as simply as I can put for you dumbasses. Somebody (insider, smart-money, whoever) who knows something we don‚Äôt know is betting BIG that this stock is hitting 30$ by the March 19th expiration. They have **OVER 600,000$ riding on this call that sits 5$ out of the money**\- it's the absolute definition of unusual options activity and when coupled with the fact the stock rarely has any options volume and it has ZERO upcoming public events something is about to happen and we just don‚Äôt know it yet. 

[Unusual Option Activity on 2\/17 for March 30c](https://preview.redd.it/b95j2t6bubk61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=35b88b935343a21aac7fb5f6d57e75ac2dffbc24)

My thoughts are pretty simple- this stock is on its way up to the fucking moon and with contracts this cheap now after a market slump the opportunity to **10X or 15X** your invest is there. Somebody knows something is going on and with UTZ ‚Äòs recent history of buying up other brands On the Border Tortilla Chips (Second leading tortilla chip brand) and Vitner‚Äôs (A Chicago based salty snack manufacturer) a merger is most likely on the horizon and undoubtedly sending this stock over 30$. This merger or announcement would send the shorts running and in an attempt to cover they‚Äôd find themselves buying back the stock at insane amounts. 

If you made it this far I bet you already are considering it so why waste your time anymore.

**TLDR: Buy March 19th 30C wait for a big random catalyst event and enjoy.**

For a deeper analysis of what I think will happen here it is:

**The most likely scenario: UTZ 32$+ Per Share 500% Return**

Unlike most of the other companies looked at on this forum UTZ actually makes money. It IPO‚Äôd via a SPAC merger and has been on a tear up over 150% since then. However, unlike your typical SPAC this company makes good money and has a good balance sheet with plenty of cash on hand. They‚Äôve been using this cash to buy other brands like crazy in hopes of expanding their market out of the mostly the northeast and midwest to the rest of the country. Their CEO Dylan Lissette has made it known on CNBC that he wants to grow the company and has aggressive plans to do so. This would lend that big better to most likely be anticipating a massive merger in the following weeks which would allow them to cash in their huge position at a massive gain. 

**The rare but plausible scenario: UTZ Short Squeeze 50$+ Per Share 5000% Return**

This will sound a little crazy but at this point I know you guys will believe anything if I put enough rockets and tell you I‚Äôll make you rich- which I am. So listen, **THIS WILL MAKE YOU RICH IF IT HAPPENS AND IT'S WORTH BETTING ON**. There is the possibility for a quick short squeeze and a subsequent gamma squeeze the likes of which would send this **WELL** stock beyond 50$. 

Here is some quick math for you:

15.23% of the stock is held by insiders.

71.26% of the stock is held by institutions. 

There are 2.95 MILLION shares SHORTED.

What this all means is that with the current amount of stock held by insiders and institutions there is only 8 millions shares free float. This becomes a big problem for the shorts very quickly if the stock price shoots up on a merger, not only because they are forced to buy back their shares BUT market makers are now involved due to the larger options orders THAT if soon become in the money will FORCE them to buy shares of the underlying stock to remain delta neutral.

As you know market makers try their best to remain delta neutral when making deals. When this big buyer came in and forced market makers to open 5,000 contracts with a delta of 0.25 they were forced to buy 25% of the shares they owed in those 5,000 contracts- to remain delta neutral as I said. 

5,000 contracts = 500,000 outstanding shares (if the contracts are in the money) 

In order to remain delta neutral they would have to purchase 125,000 shares. Which they did as seen here: When the big buy orders hit the tape at 10:11 AM we see a huge spike as market makers buy in as they need to have 125,000 shares purchased to remain delta neutral. 

[MM Big Purchase at 10:11 on 2\/17](https://preview.redd.it/gso9r544vbk61.jpg?width=1177&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2cff362d577d8fe165cfc3728b8bac6b5e7cef50)

As open interest increases and we now see it nearing closer to 7,000 contracts, as the stock moves closer to 30$ more market makers will be forced to buy in and thus leave less room for the shorts to cover their asses. If buying increases and stock is held then these shorts could be on the hook for a lot of money.

TLDR pt.2 : Short and Gamma Squeeze. Price target infinite. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

We as humans are fascinated by asymmetrical returns, I see articles people ""Yoloing"" their life savings on these worthless stocks. Yes, the share price does rise, but don't just believe a handful of people on this subreddit are responsible for it. There are hedge funds that run quant strategies which buy and sell stocks based on momentum alone and would have possibly made a ton of money on the AMC stock price run-up. So the whole narrative that you are going to stick it to ""Hedge funds"" or ""Wall Street"" is just plain wrong.

Another thing you haven't realised is these increased share prices have only allowed company insiders to cash out on their holdings, **all at your expense**.  Don't believe me, go check it out here for yourself. You believe you are doing well saving a dying company, but you are just helping company insiders become rich.

Please always do your own DD, and please apply some common sense, it would go a long way in saving, and eventually making some money.

seslmz,2022-01-28 14:54:43,"Explosion of the Memestocks, Address to the Sub, January 28, 2022","Ladies and gentlemen, I'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the S&P500, which is in absolute shambles, but the events of the past several months have led me to change those plans. Today is a day for mourning and remembering.

u/zjz and I are entertained to the core by the tragedy of the rocketship GME. We know we share this joy with all of the people of subreddit. This is truly a global shitshow.

Twelve months ago, almost to the day, we gained millions of subscribers on a brilliant mission to the moon. But we've never lost our shirts in unison like this; we've never collectively gotten crushed like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the holders of the stock; but they, the retarded apes, were aware of the dangers, but bought shares and DRS'd them anyways. We mourn the losses millions of retards who bought high and sold low along the way.

For the families of the apes, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of the knowledge that apes are retarded. But we feel their stupidity, and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, ""Give me a stock, and I'll tell all my friends to buy it."" They had a hunger to explore the markets and discover its frauds. They wished to destroy the hedgies, and they did. They destroyed Citron.

We've grown tired of the conspiracy theories on this stock. It's hard to entertain us. But for 10 years this Monday, wallstreetbets shitposting has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of high quality shitposts, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're 11.5 million shitposters strong.

And I want to say something to the paint eaters of SuperStonk who are holding onto the stock for dear life. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes other stocks exist on the market. It's all a part of having an economy with more than one company in it. It's all part of having a place for discussion that isn't a cultlike echochamber shouting the same thing over and over. The riches of the market don't belong to those who invest without doing their own research; it belongs to the DD posters who can defend their thesis against derision with verifiable facts. DeepFuckingValue and his detailed DDs was pulling us into riches, and we'll continue to do quality research that would make him proud.

I've always had great faith and respect for our DD posters, and what happened with the nonstop ""squeeze DD"" trash that followed GME does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our losses. We don't delete our incorrect DDs after the fact. We review them publicly and learn from them. That's the way high quality discussion happens, and we wouldn't change it for a minute.

We'll continue our quest for tendies. There will be more hilarious shitposts and god tier DD, and, yes, more dumb memes that people upvote for god knows why. Nothing ends once you're bankrupt; there's always someone willing to lend you money.

I want to add that I wish I could talk to every bear who posts on WSB or who submitted a trash tier meme and tell them: ""Your dedication and steadfastedness have moved and impressed us for years. Although we don't understand the nature of your brain damage, we want you to know, stocks only go up.""

There's a coincidence today. On this day 36 years ago, the great explorer Michael Smith/Scott flew the spaceship Challenger. In his lifetime the great barriers to making gains were $45 commissions for trading, and a CNBC analyst later said, ""They got their stock tips from their friends at the pub, which was a lot worse than randomly guessing."" Well, today we can say of the WSB crew: Their willingness to believe in random strangers on the internet was equally ill advised.

The apes of the moon mission GameStop and others honored us by the manner in which they shit all over the subreddit. We will never forget them, mostly because they will probably stick around for years, telling us of their journey, and wishing us losses as we continue to bet everything on companies with zero revenue and huge losses.

mhthzn,2021-04-01 11:43:48,Crash alert. Infra plan is a disappointing trojan horse for taxes,"The details of the Biden infrastructure plan are now out and let's just say that it is a huge disappointment. We were hoping for unbridled spending instead we get one time, highly precise spending items and a reversal of the Trump tax plan and then some more...

The reconciliation was meant to allow the dems to spend without any concession of tax increases but it seems that progressive dems want to raise taxes...for the purpose of raising taxes. The sellside is only starting to catch up to this reality.

First here is a summary of the tax initiatives by GS:

**A 28% corporate rate**: President Biden proposed this during the presidential campaign. Each percentage point of corporate tax rate increase raises a little over $100bn over ten years in tax revenue, so this proposal would raise between $700-800bn/10 years. *We think Congress can raise the rate to 24-25%, but might start to run into resistance among centrist Democrats between 26% and 28%.\**

**Tightening GILTI**: Similar to the Biden campaign proposal, the White House proposes to raise the effective tax rate on Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) to 21% from an effective rate of 10.5% today, move the system to a country-by-country basis that would keep companies from using tax credits from high tax jurisdictions to offset GILTI earnings in low tax jurisdictions, and rescind the policy that applies the tax to income only above a 10% return on physical capital. This would mean that the GILTI regime would apply to most companies with foreign income rather than just to IP-intensive industries like healthcare and technology, and would likely also raise taxes for companies that currently have little to no GILTI exposure. The Tax Policy Center estimated the campaign proposal would raise $442bn over ten years.

**Other international tax changes** The White House release appears to contemplate replacing the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), saying that it would replace ‚Äúan ineffective provision in the 2017 tax law that tried to stop foreign corporations from stripping profits out of the United States.‚Äù It also proposes to eliminate Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII), which encouraged US-based companies to hold their IP in the US by setting an effective tax rate on that income similar to the effective tax rate on IP held abroad and taxed through the GILTI regime.

**A minimum tax on book income** The proposal would also establish a 15% minimum tax on corporate book income reported to investors, which would serve as a check against companies that report large profits to shareholders but no profits to the IRS. The campaign proposal would have applied this globally on a country-by-country basis, but the White House release indicates only that it would apply this only to ‚Äúthe very largest corporations.‚Äù

**New restrictions on inversion**s The White House does not define what this would be, but inversions are likely to play a larger role in tax policy if the rest of the proposal were to pass, as the US would then have a high tax on the foreign earnings of multinationals compared with most other developed countries that rely on mainly

territorial tax systems.

GS Estimates a 9% hit on EPS

BAML Estimates a 7% hit to EPS 2022 (currently consensus at 200$

**Ed Yardeni**, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, wrote this week that Biden's proposed 28% corporate tax rate, if implemented, ""would reduce S&P 500 earnings per share by $15, to $200 in 2022.""

That 7% haircut is likely more than Wall Street has been pricing in. **UBS** equity strategist Keith Parker wrote on March 9 that he anticipates a 3.6% hit to EPS from Biden's tax plan.

Parker wrote that hiking the tax rate on long-term capital gains from **20% to 39.6% could slice 1.5 points off the S&P 500 P/E multiple,** potentially another 7% hit. UBS expects that not quite half that tax hike will become law.

==============================================

The only reason the sellside isn't outright bearish yet is because they seem to think that only a watered down version of this bill will pass. that's not true. via reconciliation what Biden wishes is what happens there is only one limiting swing vote in practice and that is senator Joe Manchin. Guess what the man is fine with a tax hike of A*T LEAST 25% so he LOVES THIS:*

>While he didn't predict a price tag, Manchin said Congress should do ""everything we possibly can"" to pay for it. He said there should be ""tax adjustments"" to former President Donald Trump‚Äôs 2017 tax law to boost revenues, including by raising the corporate rate from the current 21 percent to at least 25 percent.

## So for now i definitely don't see how the market can get away with pricing NONE OF THIS. BUY PUTS.

Moving on to other asset classes which will explain why I only anticipate a drawdown of 5% :

the phasing of the plan is problematic in that infra plans tend to take a long time to start hitting GDP while the taxes hit will be immediate hence it will reduce 2022 GDP growth. Without writting a whole article about the situation at the FED, the market is currently pricing a full hike in 2022 DEC. That is the most insane thing this market has ever done since GME. IT IS NOT HAPPENING.

## BUY ED DEC 2022

and the pricing out of these hikes that are not happening will help with NQ's valuation and compensate for a point or half a point of P/E hence the 5% figure.

17rlr06,2023-11-09 20:06:43,Bitcoin is going to the fucking moon.,"Hello dumb fucks,

I‚Äôve been watching Bitcoin and the crypto sphere for quite some time now, I really do believe Bitcoin could see an exponential increase of value here soon. Here are my reasons being:

1. Bitcoin is theoretically the best hedge against inflation. 

2. Current monetary assets are not backed by any real commodity. 

3. The theory behind Bitcoin and the idea of scarcity will be key to keeping this monetary asset as a highly valuable item. 

4. As the internet grows (and I believe it will grow even more within the next decade as we become more interdependent on the web and the innovation behind technology forcing us to keep up with current technological trends) will force us to think about buying commodities that will allow us to have leverage in transactions over the internet

5. Optimism is growing. With the introduction of spot ETFs and the 4 year ‚Äúhalving‚Äù, this could realistically fuel a massive bull run as it creates a sense of panic for retail investors to start buying up Bitcoin commodities to not feel left out. 

6. The classic hype surrounding scarcity. As is the same idea with diamonds, gold, and birkins, the price point is driven higher with low supply and high demands.

7. Bitcoin is becoming a more popular transaction method around the world. 

Now, I know many of you have probably come to some if not all of these conclusions on your own, but what do we make of the early bull run rotations and do we think it is feasible?",0,0.46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17rlr06/bitcoin_is_going_to_the_fucking_moon/,wallstreetbets
1cqrsoz,2024-05-13 05:33:53,Blackberry is well positioned to profit from automotive momentum. EV adoption expected to reach 80% by 2030,"Blackberry created partnerships with leading Chinese EV makers. This was a brilliant farsighted move by then CEO John Chen who's original from China. Chen was a big asset to Blackberry because he spoke Chinese and understood the culture. Blackberry partnered with BYD well before they became the top EV seller in the world ahead of Tesla. Other notable partnerships, XPend and Xiaomi. 

Chinese EV sales and production jumped almost eightfold between 2019-2023. China is the world's biggest auto market with 30 million cars sold in 2023. Although EV market share took six years to increase from 1% to 6% of the world global car sales. EV sales is expected to reach 80% adoption in the next six years by 2030. Chinese EV sales adoption is expected to reach 90% by 2030

Blackberry is positioned well to profit significantly from automotive momentum and industry transformation. 

Institutions are betting big on Blackberry in vote of confidence that the company can execute extremely well on the revenue growth strategy. There is a big growth potential especially in the IoT. Fairfax Financial, Vanguard Group Inc and First Trust Advisors LP increased their positions in Blackberry and they continue to hold millions of shares. 

On April 3 during Q4 FY24 Blackberry delivered impressive results beating the street estimates. 

On April 9 Blackberry and AMD announced a partnership on advancing Robotics technology. Lisa Su CEO of AMD selected Blackberry.

A stunning comeback is near. Blackberry is in the spotlight and the turnaround story is now a revenue growth story.

17xggdk,2023-11-17 14:36:51,Unpopular opinion: Elon Musk buying Twitter was a genius move,"Most people don't realize how valuable is Twitter in general, and for Musk in particular. 

Let's start with the general value for any owner: 

* Twitter is massive: 0.5 billion monthly users, across much of the world.
* It it especially popular among influential people: Twitter has the majority of top politicians, scientists, billionaires, writers, celebrities, etc. So, the owner of Twitter has the power to influence the people who run this planet. 
* Twitter is a massive data trove for training powerful artificial intelligence (AI). There are only a few bigger sources of data in the world.  

Twitter is especially useful for Elon Musk:

* The majority of traditional media is biased against him and his companies, for various reasons (from oil lobby to the left-leaning journalists being the majority). In the situation, it's nice to have your own mass media with 0.5 billion readers. 
* Musk's account on Twitter is one the biggest ones by the followers count, and it was so before the acquisition. Currently, he has about 160 million followers. And Twitter is the main PR channel for Musk. Buying Twitter allows him to keep it up and running.
* Tesla is basically a robots company, making robots on wheels. And the manufacturing process heavily depends on robotics too. To make smarter robots, you need smarter AIs, and for this you need a lot of training data. And Twitter happens to be one of the biggest sources of such data. This could be especially relevant for the Tesla's android project, which supposedly will have the ability to follow instructions in natural language. 
* As I understand, Musk sees the far-left as an enemy of the Western civilization. Owning a major social network allows him to counter this threat, and to promote his political views at scale.
* And his companies can run ads on Twitter for free.
* It seems that since the PayPal days, he has the idea of building an ""everything app"", something like one of those extremely popular Chinese apps, where you can do practically everything human-related from a single app, from chatting to sending money to do dating to buy pizza to hire people etc. Twitter seems to be an excellent start for that. 

Was it worth 44 billion for Musk? 

His net worth was about 250 billion at the time of the purchase. And his net worth today is again about 250 billion. So, the purchase has basically zero negative effect for him. But he has gained all the listed advantages. 

If I were in his position, I would've made the same decision.",0,0.47,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17xggdk/unpopular_opinion_elon_musk_buying_twitter_was_a/,wallstreetbets

z20m60,2022-11-22 18:15:44,UPDATE: I may have single handedly saved my local GameStop üöÄüöÄüöÄ,"**This is an update to** [**the original post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ytcgx9/i_may_have_single_handedly_saved_my_local_gamestop/) **from about 10 days ago**

After the rousing support I received from the community, I went back to check up on things at the store. This time, I brought along a clipboard so that I could document my findings and try out the demerit system that me and some of the guys (also ladies ;\]) on the SuperStonk discord server came up with for our retail employees.

I approached the storefront and pushed open both doors at the same time like an old-timey saloon. **They didn't make a sound. Not a squeak** \- GameStop has some seriously high quality doors guys.

""Hey there, welcome in."" shouted an employee from the back of the store.

I confidently strode up to address them at the counter, glancing around the store for any issues with nothing jumping out at me.""Not bad, kid,"" I remarked to him. ""Not bad at all. Looking pretty good in here. Is the manager around?"".

Visibly confused he said ""Uh, I'm the manager. Is something wrong?"".

""No, no, no, just wanted to ensure that we have a manager on duty, as it's part of the checklist.""

""Checklist?"" he asked. ""What checklist?"".

""The checklist that we the shareholders have drawn up for our retail employees. It's mostly the same stuff you've aways done, but now there's a demerit system so that we can track and punish employees for bad behavior/poor performance.""

He began to shake his head & choke out a response, but I abruptly cut him off.

""Anyway, I gotta jet. Keep up the good work, and maybe you'll get a nice NFT bonus for Christmas.""

I turned on my heel to leave when lo and behold - who do I see but the kid from last time, walking in late watching TikToks on his phone.

""Well, well, well,"" I smugly said, crossing my arms with a smirk dancing across my lips. ""Look who decided to show up.""

The kid looked up in surprise and his eyes immediately grew to the size of dinner plates.

""That's the guy!"" he shouted to the manager behind me. ""That's the guy I told you about the other day, the one from corporate"".

""You work at the corporate office?"" the manager asked me.

""Not physically, but I am however a partial owner of the company"".

""Dude, look, you don't work here,"" he suggested. ""I don't care if you own a couple of shares or whatever, you can't be coming in here being rude to us. Why do you care so much about this place anyway?"".

Now, I'm not a very big guy (5'4 ¬æ), but I sized him up and was pretty sure that if push came to shove I could take him.

""Why do I care?"" I mirrored back to him, stealthily adjusting my feet into a fighting stance. ""Ever heard of a dark pool? How about a short ladder? Maybe a cellar box? No? Well that's is what we're up against, **and it's a fucking war.** You think that hiring little piss worms like this kid right here who come in late every day and allows people steal Funko Pops anytime they want is helping the battle? That's a demerit. Congrats on earning the first one in GameStop history, kid.""

He threatened to call the police, so I chose to be the bigger person and leave as to not disturb any customers when they begin to pour in.

**TLDR;** I was able to weed out a bad manager at a GameStop location who didn't align with our values as shareholders. I will be calling the corporate office to demand his termination, as well as request to participate in the interview for his replacement.

**Debt**

**Future Box Office Slate**

**Film Exhibition Cost**
 
**A Scumbag CEO Who Exploits Underage Ballerinas**

Before COVID hit they were sort of making a profit and had assets to cover liabilities by a slight margin

That margin tightened in 2019 and by 2020 they were officially in the hole which has grown to $3 billion 

They refinanced most of the debt in 2020 and that starts to mature in 2024 and again in 25/26/27 if they make it that far

Now that they have blown through all the postponed COVID blockbusters and a pretty solid 2023 film slate and still have shitty financials it‚Äôs over

Plus all the film distributors are dicking them over on box office splits using streaming platforms as leverage 

If a movie does better than expected they go back and ask for more money 

The 2024/2025 film slate is embarrassing 

Forget the Tay Tay revenue

That shit is going to take a hit after the 69 year old CEO was sending dick pics and trying to fuck underage ballerinas

The guy who extorted this idiot is like Chris Hansen and should get all the charges dropped for being a hero catching this sick fuck before he caused more harm 

The Board apparently found out yesterday which is bullshit or they just looked the other way instead of doing their jobs

They should have fired him on the spot and then fired themselves

üá∫üá∏ As far as specifications go, we know that the four in-wheel hub motors produce a total of 600 HP (608 HP), enough for a 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) sprint of 5.5 seconds and a governed top speed of 80 mph (128 km/h).

The 80 mile per hour limit is a standard set based on feedback from fleet managers.  The true story is that customers and fleet managers can remove the governor 100%.

üá∫üá∏ There are three brand new stamping presses that are worth about $24M. If we were to replace even one of our stamping lines, it would cost over $30M each.

The factory is comprised of over 6M square feet and fully owned by Lordstown Motors.

üá∫üá∏ The hub motors will be validated for 100,000 miles and require little maintenance, Post said during the tour: ‚ÄúThe hub motor itself will never need service.‚Äù 

He then said the motor ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt break,‚Äù explaining, ‚ÄúThere's no oil, there's no pistons and those are lifetime bearings for the vehicle.‚Äù

We are completely confident for the hub motor manufacturing readiness. Hub motor assembly... This area covers 400,000 square feet and has annual capacity for 240,000 hub motors.  all of our manufacturing equipment has been built, validated, and has been shipped.  We will be starting our installation and commissioning process in the next two weeks.   We will be ready to continue producing hub motors, now in house.  - Restated June 25, 2021.

üá∫üá∏ Endurance Production is September with conservative 20,000 units being delivered by May 2022.   They‚Äôve been clear that the ATVM Loan or asset backed financing will speed up the production ramp up to double.  The van prototype is being completed and will be displayed ‚Äúby the end of summer.‚Äù  Military prototypes were onsite and driven during Lordstown Week.

üá∫üá∏ General assembly from when we first receive the cab until when we can drive the endurance off the end of the line is eight hours.  Our system is flexible enough that we can change some gapping and line speed, reducing down to as low as four hours.

We can build 30 jobs per hour in the body shop. There are 900 robots, just in the body shop.

üá∫üá∏ Our battery packs are warrantied for 8 years, 100,000 miles.  We do not expect any degredation prior to the warranty expiration.  Level 2 charging, maximum AMP is about 45 amps, using 11KW charger.  We do have high speed DC charging, which is 470 amps using 150KW charger.

Battery Pack protected perfectly.  Cooling is built in.

The battery shop is led by 25-year experience engineer that came from Tesla.

üá∫üá∏ There are eight color pallets: electric white, grit grey, titanium silver, and nightshift black.  Premium color: Forest Service Green, Municipal Yellow, Petrol Blue Metallic, and Town Red.

vtn2u4,2022-07-07 16:47:27,GME stock dividend is not the same as stock split dammit!!!,"EDIT:

ok lets go back to basic math.

If there is 1000 share. and gme declare 1 dollar dividend per share

and there is 200 share that is shorted.

short seller need to pay the dividend, which is 200 dollar.

&#x200B;

so now, will GME pay out 800 dollar or 1000 dollar?

clearly only 800 right? because the other 200, already got paid by short seller.

&#x200B;

or are you saying gme pay 1000 in dividend, and short seller pay 200. for a total of 1200 in dividend?

&#x200B;

so what is it? will gme pay 800 in dividend, and short seller pay 200

or will gme pay 1000 and short seller pay 200?

&#x200B;

we all know gme does not pay 1000, short seller pay 200 because that would be an extra 200 of dividend that doesnt go anywhere,

we know short seller has to pay 200 in dividend.

that mean, gme ONLY need to come up with 800 in dividend, not 1000.

&#x200B;

hopefully all the people that say i am wrong can figure out the logic, but then we are on WSB so probably not. LOL

&#x200B;

EDIT EDIT:

ok so 1000 share. 1 dollar dividend. assume only 1 person own all 1000 share.

A get 1000 in dividend.

S borrow 200 share. and they sold it to B

B now own 200 ""borrowed share""

S need to pay 200 to B for dividend.

S need to pull $200 out of his ass, to pay B. does S go back to A and say hey let me borrow 200 to pay B? nope, he get it from his ass. This cost him $200 dollar.

&#x200B;

So now, change it to stock dividend.

A get 1000 stock as dividend from GME

S borrow 200 share, sold it to B

B now own 200 share. and need to receive 200 share in dividend from S

S need to pull out 200 share from his ass to give to B. His ass doesn't have any. he can't get it from his ass. So he goes back to his buddy A, and say he you got some extra share, I need to borrow it also. A goes what the hell? when money was given, you pull it out of your ass, but now it's shares, your ass don't have it huh? and you want to borrow it from me? ok, but it will be 1 million ok? you know, supply, demand, times are changing, inflation, i need to pay my wife's BF??

larxmg,2021-02-02 09:32:16,Going against the grain and looking at possible exits for GME in the worst case,"This is probably going to get downvoted to oblivion but after being very bullish last Thursday I have **changed** my opinion over the weekend and yesterday.

&#x200B;

It seems a lot of people here are emotional and are just in it to stick to wallstreet. 

Personally, I am not part of wallstreetbets to stick it to anyone or to make myself be a martyr for any cause. I am in it to make money. While I personally support a lot of views here and the blatant bs that is happening in form of **market manipulation**, brokers like RH having issues with their **clearing houses** (or so they claim) and **restricting trading**, **media**, and a bunch of other infuriating factors makes me pissed too. 

However, hijacking the sub just for GME and not burying all other DD is just dumb. 

&#x200B;

**But the moment you start investing with your emotions you lose.**

At the moment I feel extremely blind since I do not know what is real and what is manufactured info and we do not know the real short interest. **That plus all these emotions from people here is** making me uneasy.

&#x200B;

# I am trying to look for a potential exit.

Based on the short interest reported being so low, it seems a lot of shorts have covered their positions (this could be manipulated data but we have to go on what we have). It seems they did most of their covering AH and during retail sell-offs that they artificially created by manipulating the price in AH.

&#x200B;

# Retail vs Institution change in the charts:

It does seem that most of retail has gotten in on Monday and Tuesday and that after that it was institutions playing their games. You can see this by how radically different the graphs look for days after Tuesday of last week.

&#x200B;

[Volume and the movement of price is completely different after Wednesday  which makes me think it is institutions and other hedge funds that got it to trade volatility, notice the massive price gaps AH ](https://preview.redd.it/evdnw7xd71f61.png?width=1545&format=png&auto=webp&s=5594df708bbf563cc18f4e1ddf06d53139fdb54d)

&#x200B;

This with the addition of restriction of retail buyers is making me bearish because I believe that the shorts managed to get out during this time and the new shorts got in while the older ones blew up earlier and have covered during AH.

&#x200B;

# Supports to avoid shakeouts:

It seems that the last support level around $160 range if broken is what would trigger me to sell. There was one wick that went as low as $110 on the 28th, this is a problem because during the free fall of the breakers it broke through the $160 support like nothing yet recovered. Setting a stop loss at $160 could cause your position to just be shaken out. But setting your stop loss at $110 or below is too low imo but could be a reasonable stop loss to prevent getting shaken out of your position if you believe the short squeeze is still coming.

&#x200B;

[Trying to avoid getting shaken out at $110, this was probably their test to see how low they can flash crash the price to pick up as many shares if they were to cover their shorts.](https://preview.redd.it/bxtxqa4n71f61.png?width=1543&format=png&auto=webp&s=567bd77db52fe4b7a2bc4b5664664f36944d1e7f)

&#x200B;

# Comparison with VW in 2008

The balancing act here is finding the sweet spot where you will not get shaken out in case the data is manipulated and the squeeze rockets to $1000+/share but also not to be low enough that your losses are massive.

&#x200B;

[You want to avoid selling here and not get shaken out \( I believe that would be $110 for GME\)](https://preview.redd.it/my0icm4s71f61.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=5772850ff659033abbc5e03a3c2bff38976c5e54)

&#x200B;

If you are more conservative I would take the profits around 160, if you want to potentially wait for squeeze and not get shaken out $110 seems like a reasonable stop loss.

Depending on the pre-market sentiment by morning I will be looking to either get out at 160 or holding.

&#x200B;

I am not trying to scare anyone just trying to do my own exit strategy, Do your own research. I do not have a crystal ball. After the official short interest is released I may look to reenter the position in GME if I get out, but profit is profit till then.

Robinhood is probably the most undervalued company in the entire market at the moment.

**A conservative assessment of their balance sheet and metrics:**

Market Cap: $6.90B USD

Balance Sheet (Cash + other assets) : $6.5B USD

Yearly Revenue (forward looking): \~$2.2 B

Yearly Expenses (forward looking): \~$1.9B

Expected Profit (forward looking): \~$300 million

**Adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months : $485 million**

&#x200B;

Now here's the kicker:

Everybody thinks they're losing customers becaue their MAU number is going down. I don't know why they report it the way that they do. The real number that matters is the number of Gold subscribers. That is the REAL number of users. MAUs are fickle and unreliable number that doesn't really matter.

The # of Gold users has been growing at >20% YOY very consistently, and has consistent quarter over quarter growth.

This is a growing business with an extremely strong balance sheet. Also, they are probably the brokerage that treats their customers the best (5% APY, free trades, 24/7 customer support, extremely good UI, probably the best spreads on crypto in the industry).

Conservatively, this should be trading at 20 P/E + $6 billion = $12 billion market cap.

From my previous prediction (I got shit on predicting Russia will invade and to by boil), I believe everything runs on game theory.

Edit: I didn‚Äôt go into the game theory, I briefly mentioned it. Biden and allies vs putin. They have interdependent decisions to make. But ah well, forgot this is wsb and everyone is a regard, ie I should have spelled it out. But google game theory and understand the full context of what is happening 

So from recent events, I‚Äôm back to posting about game theory and predict what will happen.

1. The war is nearly over
2. It‚Äôll cause oil to dump hard
3. World will enter deflation since we have supply surpluses and abundant energy and oil.
4. Fed will pivot
5. QE will begin
6. Ukraine will be the next money pit
7. Biden will be re-elected 

Main is number 1. Putin only has 2 options now, nuke or negotiate. US and nato allies know this, so they‚Äôll push until they know they can‚Äôt anymore anymore and pivot to negotiations. Biden will ‚Äúbroker‚Äù the negotiation. It‚Äôll cause Russia to start selling oil again. Saudi‚Äôs will be scared that US and Russia are on talking terms again and begin to let the oil flow. (Not sure if Biden will hold a grudge against Saudi Arabia, they may).

Oil and gas will drop insanely. That coupled with surplus supply and unemployment happening, fed will have to pivot.

Depending on how mad unemployment actually is, fed may have to cut interest rates and may have pause QT.

I expect stock market to fly, but if for some reason it doesn‚Äôt, QE will happen.

Biden will use ending the war and reversing inflation. They‚Äôll also blame inflation of trump.

Biden will get re-elected.

Mainly, the conflict only has 2 ways to go now, Putin pushes the button or Putin stops the war. Since this is a 0 sum game, the war will end.

Caveat, if putin is actually sick and doesn‚Äôt give a f about anything, buy a bunker! ü§£",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10pjbhi/game_theory_the_war_will_end_soon_oil_will/,wallstreetbets

leqhhy,2021-02-07 17:06:40,"GME, Mob Mentality, and the irresponsibility of Reddit hype.","

This isn't new, but the extremes have moved significantly.  Never before have I seen so many people lose so much out of sheer ignorance. 

**First and foremost I want to establish a fact: Short squeezes are not permanent.**

I made a post a week ago telling everyone that short squeezes were not permanent.  GME opened at over $300 that day.  By Friday it would close at $63.  The mechanics of a short squeeze make this an inevitability.  They are, by definition, a short term event fueled by a sudden spike in demand, an unsustainable spike in demand driven by short covering.  That demand is necessarily going to end.  So, when you see a stock skyrocket from the 20s to over 300 in the matter of a week taking a long position is a less constructive use of your money than just burning cash for heat.

**What this isn't: an ""I told you so"".**

  I don't really care about that.  The red on the ledger is enough for people to eventually learn they were wrong.  Sure, they'll grovel about conspiracies for a bit, Janet Yellen called Vlad and told him to fuck the retail investors.  Hedge funds had a ""short ladder attack"" (for why that's not a rea, [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the_myth_of_the_short_ladder_attack/) or [here](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qdq0y5b79rzb/Wallstreetbets-Conspiracy-Theorists-Claim-a-Short-Ladder-Attack-Brought-Down-GameStop-Short-Sellers-Have-No-Idea-What-They-re-Talking-About).  They'll claim that the DTC intentionally stopped out retail order flow, despite retail orders being [net sells](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop) for most of this endeavor.  Whatever, so you're going to see a lot of blame on anything but the fact that it's obviously not smart to go long at the top of a goddamn short squeeze.  This is the financial equivalent of doing 150MPH on a dirt road then blaming the tires, the loose gravel, the 2mph headwind, or interstellar radio waves altering your tire pressure when you crash.  No, you shouldn't have been doing 150MPH on a dirt road. 

_______

**What this is: reflecting on the mob**

The shameful part of this is that in your foaming at the mouth rabid need to believe in this story you downvoted and ridiculed anyone who brought up risks, you attacked news agencies who called it irresponsible, you barraged threads and subreddits with hype posts.  For the first time in this sub's entire history we actually had to restrict posting

I spoke with a reporter for a major publication working on this story, and he relayed that he recently interviewed a homeless man who bought three shares at $315 hoping to get himself out of poverty.  do you know how much $945 can do for a homeless person??  There's [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/la3bft/emotional_involvement_has_never_been_this_high/glob1kf/?context=3), where a disabled man on government support hopes to build a house with GME gains, again buying in near the top.  These are two examples, but there are hundreds if not thousands more.

20 year old middle class kids blowing their beer money for the month on GME doesn't bother me.  who cares.  But these are people who cannot afford to  a few hundred dollars.  These are setbacks that could have equated to months worth of food, new wardrobes, necessary medical attention, etc. 

We can never prevent those in poor financial situations from making poor decisions, but we can and absolutely should hold ourselves to the standard that we will at least not foster an environment that encourages poor decisions.  Many of you will lay blame elsewhere, but if you downvoted a post discussing risks of GME, accused someone of being a shill, encouraged someone to buy without first understanding their situation, etc. then you are culpable here.  

------

**You can, but should you?**

Much has been said about Reddit's ability to affect the outside world, and now just like with the Boston bombing everyone dove in head first without bothering to examine the risks, the drawbacks, the losses, and the ramifications for those who can't afford them.  

**So, what did Reddit accomplish here?**

Ultimately, nothing aside from transferring a lot of retail wealth to institutional funds, again.  Sure, we can jerk off all day to Melvin's down month.  Perhaps they were hedged and they'll have a monster January, perhaps they were not.  But all of the other funds that took the long end of this early on, with managers that understood the aspects of short squeezes - they bailed out in the 200-300 range selling some to short and some to unwitting retail investors engaged in a fervent and ultimately useless battle against some imaginary foe.  

This wasn't social justice, it wasn't some populist uprising, and I don't care how much AOC, Ted Cruz, Mark Cuban, or the Pope wants to dogpile in on this.  There was nothing that happened here aside from a bunch of retail traders who didn't know what they were doing encouraging a whole lot of other retail investors who couldn't afford it to give away money they didn't have to institutions.  

Next time y'all want to effect change just have a charity drive for UNICEF, or send money to a PAC focused on fighting inequality.  Write your senator, picket congress (peacefully, no mob bullshit), organize a sit in, whatever.  But let's not encourage broke people to give their hard earned thousands to hedge funds.  

**And most importantly, the next time this happens, because it will happen again, for the love of shitt try to understand what the fuck is going on before jumping on the hype train.  And stop downvoting and ridiculing people that do understand what is happening with an opinion you don't like.**

t2y2yt,2022-02-27 21:17:20,Evidence: We are already in 'WWIII' and we are having trouble admitting it,"[Instant Updates](https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/russia-continues-ukraine-invasion-live-updates) reveal that all U.S. ambassadors are leaving Russia.  Russia has also threatened Nuclear War, in raising the readiness to use its nuclear stockpile.  Further, Russia has surrounded and physically encircled Kyiv.  This, eventually will starve out millions of innocent civilians in Ukraine.

Further, in the middle of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russia spoke with Iran, a country which routinely shouts ""Death to America.""  Also, China's #1 grossing film of 2021 was ""The Battle at Lake Changjin.""  Hundreds of times in this film oh, that I personally watched, Americans were being depicted as Nazi-like people. This was a state-driven, pre-conflict propaganda movie.  Everyone should see how 'the West' is being falsely depicted.  And today, we can see that Russia's main propaganda arm, while he invades Ukraine, is to 'denazify' Ukraine, which makes no sense because Ukraine's president is Jewish.

Reports now show China leaked U.S.-provided intel back to Russia.  Yesterday, North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.  Today, China spoke with North Korea, citing [a ""new situation,""](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-message-nkoreas-kim-vows-cooperation-under-new-situation-kcna-2022-02-25/) on the same day that Russia has threatened nuclear war. And finally, it should be noted that China spoke out in its ""support' of Russia during this situation.

TLDR: We are already living in World War III and we are all failing to admit that.  Wake up and BET accordingly. ""The Great Reset"" in global markets will now occur. I'll be looking at the kings and queens of 'meme' stocks to see some particular fireworks there, as I see them now as the best companies with the highest level of support.  And, the value-at-risk (VaR) and volatility (Vol) coefficients (NSCC's capital requirements algorithm) will 100% trigger margin calls on hedge funds' egregious and illicit short-borrow position on meme stocks, which from the latest Bloomberg report shows that there are 8.6 counterfeit shares for every one real share.",0,0.46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t2y2yt/evidence_we_are_already_in_wwiii_and_we_are/,wallstreetbets

zere98,2022-12-07 03:59:05,"Tesla will be the Myspace of the EV market. Tesla Semi will not change that, just like Myspace music did not save Myspace.","TL:DR - Tesla is only #1 in EV because they were first. Their market share will only decrease from here, Tesla Semi will not change that, in 5 years they will not even be a top 5 EV manufacturer.

Tesla created the EV market, no one can deny that. Companies become market makers by creating and cornering a market before there is real competition, then staying ahead of the newcomers.

New companies try to create new markets all the time. Few are successful. Even fewer create truly NEW markets, most are just iterations past old norms. EV vehicles are not a new market, they are an iteration on the norms of the consumer vehicle market. This means Tesla not only has to defend against newcomers to the consumer electric vehicle space, but they have to compete against very successful consumer vehicle manufacturers altering their established brands in EV's.

The F-150 is best selling truck, for decades, period. In the USA trucks have an exceptionally loyal customer base, and oversized market share. What Loyal Ford or Chevy owner would choose the cyber truck over the Lightning or Silverado EV? Its rhetorical moron, everyone knows there is not enough to be statistically relevant.

Tesla is only #1 in the EV space because they created that market and have not yet had to face real world competition. During that time they have failed to establish a market cornering brand. Right now Ford, Chevrolet, and Hyundai/Kia are all competing to be #2 in the EV market had have openly stated their intention to be #1 in the EV space in the next 5 years or so.

Before trying to mumble something about ""Tesla's innovation"" around Elon's dick, stop and think about this example. When Toyota entered the truck market they created a new ""small truck"" market. The overwhelming success of the Toyota truck that was eventually named the Tacoma launched them to success in the truck market. Nissan and other imports jumped on the small truck market, but the Nissan offering never hit it big in that space, Why? Because Ford launched the Ranger and Chevrolet the S10 and quickly claimed the #2 and #3 spots. Toyota is still a dominant player in ""small trucks"", but only barely and never managed to corner that market, and they were already a reputable and trusted car brand when they created that marked. Toyota is only dominant in the ""small"" truck space, their larger truck offerings cant come close to the F-150 or Silverado. Tesla was not a reputable or trusted manufacturer when they created this market, and I would argue still are not reputable or trustworthy. Look at Elon, he wasted $44 billion buying a social media company, just so he can ruin his reputation faster than he was by just being a social media user, how does that inspire trust in the brand?!?

Tesla Semi is not their savior, it is proof they are the Myspace of the social media world. Tesla created a market where no one thought one would exist (or so oil propaganda had everyone convinced), but now that the value behind the market has been established, how can Tesla out compete Ford or Toyota? All of Tesla's profitable models are in the ""luxury"" space where the margins are higher. Tesla is struggling to produce their still very expensive economy"" model 3, which can not compete against true ""economy"" EV's like the Leaf. Eventually Mercedes EV's will be preferred in the luxury EV space and the model 3 will never be able to compete with a Civic EV or Corolla EV. I am planning to buy an EV in 2024 and if there is a Civic EV, the Model 3 would have to have equal quality, and a LOWER price to even be considered, and would still also have to compete with Leaf etc. Why? Because Nissan entered the EV market years after Tesla, yet their very first EV, offered 2014, still sets a standard for quality/reliability in the EV space that Tesla can not equal even in 2021.

I am not a trader or quant and this is not meant to be investment advice. This is just the view of someone who was a top notch Automotive technician for over 10 years before transitioning to industrial Robotics. Now I repair and maintain the Multi-hundred Million dollar robots that make computer chips for a major player in the industry. I am best described as an Electronics/Mechanical Engineer, or ""Mechatronics engineer/specialist"" in industry lingo. This does make me uniquely qualified to evaluate the underlying technologies of the products offered by the various vehicle manufacturers, though I can not advise on how market will react, or if market even understands the underlying tech.

now you might be wondering why for the love of god would elon jump in? and that would be a very valid question. IF he did, the simple reason would be because he hates hedgies that short companies to death with naked shorts just as much as RC and us apes, and there is already some evidence of a connection between RC and elon, so just a plausible theory imo.

Member when $GME squeezed?  I do.  There was some gamma stuff in there, and some short covering, the price went up over 20x, it was *fucking crazy.*

[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/tzNXdnn.png).

That was then, this is now, here's what we know:

* Wall street is rigged
* The buy pressure momentum got castrated mid climax 
* The shorts shorting at $10 probably got out at a loss, new shorts probably entered in the upper ranges and made bank
* The cost to all short holders is significantly depressed at the current market price. [Cheap shorts are available](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME).
* If there was a day of reckoning when shorts all had to buy-in at once it would certainly be ugly, the numbers don't lie, there are a lot of shares short out there that may be impossible to cover
* The only way for a buy-in to happen is upward momentum caused by buy-pressure
* Unless you guys have a bottomless money pit or major market participants enter that's probably not going to happen
* No matter how much you shame each other and throw away your life savings there is no guarantee that the price spikes again
* Don't turn this into a ponzi scheme

o49rck,2021-06-20 16:48:36,HEAR ME OUT: WE SHORT EVERYTHING,"Let‚Äôs start with the obvious that everyone needs to be talking about; oil. 


The disconnect and overvaluation in oil futures is so fucking nonsensical that I would bet come Oct-Nov the average national US gas price will be in the 2.3-2.4 range, if not lower. The disconnect we‚Äôre seeing is something I‚Äôve only found 2 other times in the last decade plus. The last time was in 2018. [In June the price average was 2.98, by Christmas and into early 2019 it sat 2.35-2.45.](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&f=m) Prior to 2018 it was 2008. A year in which the price of gas topped 4.11 avg. and by the end of the year was sitting in the 1.7-1.9 range, obviously the Great Recession contributed to it. Now here is 2021, the national average in May was 3.07 and the overvaluation is greater than 2018 but not as bad as 2007-2008 appeared. Food for thought.

&nbsp;

Next, the stock market is more overvalued than it has ever been. Ever. The [Total Market to GDP is 198% overvalued](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/60/ratio-of-wilshire-5000-over-gnp). For reference ‚ÄòNormal‚Äô would be in the 95-120 range. If we look at the Top Stocks by Index weight the sign is not pretty. Tesla has begun it‚Äôs crack and it may just be a matter of weeks before its 50 Avg. falls below its 200 Avg. (for the dumb, that ain‚Äôt good.) Amazon and Apple have somewhat plateaued in recent months and show signs that a regress is in store. Basically the big weights holding this shit together is looking not good. We can take a look at the Dow and SP500 individually and it tells roughly the same story with the both taking a dump in the last few days.

&nbsp;


[The Fed has already begun to say the will not hike rates next year](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/feds-kashkari-opposed-to-rate-hikes-at-least-through-2023.html), we‚Äôre walking on egg shells and nobody anywhere is doing anything worthwhile to prepare for the worst. We‚Äôre using a condom we know has a hole in it we put there and know the partner isn‚Äôt on birth control. We‚Äôre playing with fire and about to get burnt, well poor people mostly because I‚Äôm sure they will take the majority of the blame with [the BS stories they‚Äôre pushing with UI benefits.](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/07/truth-behind-unemployment-benefits-myth)

&nbsp;


Basically I am expecting over the course of the next year or so for the beginning of a recession on par with or worse than 2008. I believe 2020 will be looked at as the body ache before the actual flu sets in. The signs are all there and will just become solidified over the coming months. Early this year the war was on Short Sellers now it needs to be on the bullish and the greedy because they and the current system are going to fuck us all over even more.

1. They intentionally try to reach the All front page in an attempt to recruit new people into their Ponzi scheme with promises of turning $200 into $60,000,000

2. They routinely make posts about how they‚Äôre forgoing medication, food, and shelter for themselves and loved ones so they can buy more shares

3. They‚Äôve infested every single investing subreddit and control conversation through their brigading. A stock goes down? Well the reason is ‚Äúcrime‚Äù of course. That‚Äôs the highly upvoted answer on any investment sub. But don‚Äôt dare ask them to explain more, they can‚Äôt.

4. Remember when there was $1.40 worth of volume on Sears Canada the other day, a 320,000% increase in price? Well they were all over every investing sub talking about how criminal that $1.40 in volume was. What an absolutely retarded take.

5. They‚Äôre actively hoping for a cataclysmic market event that will destroy hundreds of millions of peoples lives, through hyperinflation on a scale never before seen, so they can finally be rich. All while claiming they‚Äôre just fighting greed. How the fuck does that square?

6. They use drones to spy on employees trying to do their jobs

7. They stalk airplanes and make highly upvoted posts like ‚Äúhes landing, london apes do your thing‚Äù

8. They continually talk about violence, using guillotines to behead those who they deem are manipulating GameStop stock

Nah dude, fuck these cultist idiots. If they kept contained on their cult subs it‚Äôd be one thing. But that‚Äôs not enough. They need to control every single investing sub with their conspiratorial nonsense and continual efforts to get those with less knowledge to buy into their bullshit.

1c2ad4f,2024-04-12 14:19:51,GoPro is ridiculously cheap fundamentally. ,"I think stock is should  atleast trade at 2-3x the current price.  Market cap is just 200 mil ? 

They have bought at least 40 mil in stocks in 2023. Are you kidding me?

Fundamental thesis: 
- Strategic Shift and Innovation: GoPro has evolved its business model from selling just hardware to combining hardware sales with subscription services and premium services launched in February 2024. This shift towards a more service-oriented model aims to provide a steady revenue stream and enhance customer loyalty.

- Financial Performance: GoPro has shown significant cash generation improvements over the years. For example, from an average cash usage of $46 million in the years before 2020, to generating $91 million and $221 million in subsequent years, although there was a slight dip to $2 million in cash generation in 2023. Despite this, GoPro managed to partially repay its convertible debt and repurchase $40 million in stock in 2023.

- Market Presence: GoPro has maintained its position as a leading brand in the U.S. camcorder market, with the HERO12 BLACK being the best-selling camera. The company boasts a strong social media presence with millions of followers and billions of lifetime views on its YouTube channel, indicating a robust market reach and brand recognition.

- Recent Acquisition: GoPro's acquisition of Forcite, aimed at enhancing the performance and safety of helmets, starting with motorcycle helmets, signals GoPro's intention to expand its market presence into new segments, leveraging its brand strength in motorsports and among motorcycle enthusiasts.

- Subscription Services Growth: The company has seen growth in its subscription services, with a notable increase in the average selling price (ASP) of its cameras and a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 69% for its subscription services. The subscriber renewal rates show increasing loyalty, with more than 80% renewal rate by the third year.

- Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): GoPro highlighted its commitment to CSR with initiatives like employee engagement, diversity, and sustainability goals. The company aims to source 100% renewable energy for its U.S. locations by 2026 and has disclosed its greenhouse gas emissions.

- Financial Highlights:  Revenue showed a slight decline in 2023 compared to previous years, but the adjusted EBITDA remained positive, indicating a healthy operational profit margin. There's also a notable shift in the MSRP camera revenue mix, with a higher percentage of cameras being sold at prices above $400 MSRP in 2023 compared to 2019.

Analyzing these points, GoPro's strategic focus on diversification through subscription services, its strong brand presence, and recent initiatives to penetrate new markets suggest a solid foundation for growth. While there was a dip in cash generation in 2023, GoPro's ability to maintain profitability and invest in strategic acquisitions and stock repurchases demonstrates financial resilience. Given this context, a market cap of $200 million might seem conservative, especially when considering the company's assets, equity, and strategic positioning for future growth. The information suggests that GoPro is actively working to expand and solidify its market presence, which could potentially increase its valuation in the eyes of investors looking beyond the immediate financial figures to the company's growth potential and strategic initiatives.",1,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c2ad4f/gopro_is_ridiculously_cheap_fundamentally/,wallstreetbets

* 1 billion dollars investment and majority ownership in Argo AI which received a multi billion dollar investment from VW early last year. Argo AI is the team putting together Ford's autonomous vehicle. They must have been doing something right for VW to invest billions in them.
* Partnership with VW that allows Ford to use VW's MEB platform (ID3, ID4).
* 7.6% stake in Velodyne, a LIDAR company. How many autonomous vehicles do you see without LIDAR? No, not even the Tesla's with the ""full self driving beta"" are fully autonomous.

umyjua,2022-05-11 01:48:19,"Did some digging. Did you know the theories GME investors have about naked shorting are the same, recycled conspiracies from over a decade ago?","https://imgur.com/a/qDdRfD1

http://imgur.com/a/ffJNaC0

TL;DR: investors have been blaming negative price action on illegal naked shorting for decades. Modern day apes are using the same, rehashed arguments as their predecessors who fell for similar pump and dumps.

I recently went down a rabbit hole after reading the recent posts on SS about CMKM. Apes claim this case is evidence that trillions of ""fake shares"" are possible. I found the above article which perfectly describes the similar situation some CMKM investors found themselves in after the fraud committed by CMKM execs was exposed. Rather than accept their losses, they held onto the lie that it was all the fault of naked short sellers.

To be clear, I don't believe there has been any fraud at the GME exec level. The parallels I draw are between the investors that refuse to accept reality, and rather blame everything on naked short selling. In GME's case the fraudsters, in my opinion, are the DD writers. They recklessly mislead apes in fields they have no experience in. They misinterpret data and con the unknowing into believing a financial conspiracy. Not to mention the shameless self promotion of their paid services and fund raisers that we have seen from some mods.

Further parallels can be seen in the below article which states ""Some pranced around the offices of the villainous Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. in 2005 (I work there, according to these morons), made damned fools of themselves and diverted scarce police resources.""

http://garyweiss.blogspot.com/2009/09/indictments-in-cmkm-diamonds-naked.html?m=1

The article references another similar case, that of Universal Exchange. This is another example of a company exec using the excuse of naked short sellers to defraud investors.

https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/what-will-you-bid-for-a-lawsuit/

I find it quite hilarious that in the comments of the above article there are people making the same arguments as modern day apes. There are references to rule changes, rigging allegations, references to FTDs and allegations of people working for naked shorters.

The former CEO of Universal Express was sentenced to prison for securities fraud in 2014, by the way.

https://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/news/2014/05/06/ex-universal-express-ceo-altomate-prison-sentence.html

I also found the fantastic article below. I'm not sure when it was written (I think around 2010), but it details this sort of thing happening since the 1990s. I particularly like this quote: ""many fall prey to hysterical hoopla purporting to explain how naked shorting is responsible¬†for the untimely deaths of ‚Äútens of thousands‚Äù of worthy startup companies, and will even one day cause the collapse of the global economy.""

My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty threads‚Äîor very early mornings shitposts‚Äîwhen I checked WSB half-crazy and, instead of cashing out, aimed the big $1650 Robinhood account towards GameStop at $325 per share, wearing cummed-stained shorts and a ramen-stained shirt. . .chucking rent money into AMC at $16 per share, not quite sure what my exit strategy was (always stalling at the sell button, too autistic to take profits while I fumbled for more YOLO money) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I traded I would come to a place where people were just as retarded and üíé ‚úãed as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .

There was madness in any stonk, at any hour. If not across GME, then in AMC or BB or NOK. . . . You could strike tendies anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .

And that, I think, was the handle‚Äîthat sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Boomers and Hedge Funds. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn‚Äôt need that. Our autism would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting‚Äîon our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of GameStop, a high and beautiful wave. . . .

So now, less than a week later, you can go up a steep chart on Robinhood and scroll back, and with the right kind of autism you can almost see the high-water price‚Äîthat place at $500 per share where the wave finally broke and rolled back.",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc33yg/losses_and_bagholding_on_robinhood_a_retrospective/,wallstreetbets

1bxyp75,2024-04-07 07:39:42,RIVN is undervalued and it's LEAPS aren't priced in,"Due to my unextensive research I believe that RIVN is going to absolutely print in the long run. After IPO, the stock immediatly tanked, with most investors believing that the stock was overvalued. Common reasons for this were that the company is still largely in the investment stage, and despite having a product in the hands of consumers, is still not profitable. With a net income of -5.4b in 2023, the company definetly still has a long way to go, no doubt about it, and most investors rightfully decided to leave the stock alone.  


That being said, the value of the company should not be determined by its current value, but by its potential. It is an ""investment"" after all. With the highest customer satisfaction in the industry, a new line of vehicles, and EVs taking over, this sentiment will surely change. Most people acknowledge that Rivian will almost certainly take a huge market share in the future, but because that is such a distant prospect, and because the stock's lifetime graph is so pathetic, I beleive that Rivian's price is not only the lowest it will probably ever be (not specifically *now,* but in general. I don't see it ever sitting in the tens after 2030), but that Rivian's potential to breach its IPO within the next few years is not priced in at all.  


In short, Rivian's stock value and options pricing are a response to aggressive short term trading and panic, and not indicitive of long term investment. This is the dip.  


It would be absolutely unrealistic to assume that RIVN will breach it's IPO price within the next 2 years, but it will very likely double as R2 and R3 roll out. 5-8 years I am very optimistically bullish. and believe that it can break it's IPO. Deep ITM and OTM 2yr LEAPS can't go tits up, and the OTM LEAPS can always be rolled into new OTM LEAPS every 6 months to avoid theta decay.

EDIT Jun 26:

So VW just gave Rivian 5 billion. Stock goin up fr. Here's the kicker: I never had the chance to actually buy the LEAPS I was so vocal about because I was busy moving from one state to another. I'm closing on an apartment THIS WEEK and I was gonna dump my money into RIVN once I'd done that.. rip.

$RIDE üö® Lordstown is well position with minimal high-cost of maintenance parts. Gear boxes and other parts that will need to be maintained on other EV Trucks will allow the Endurance to be hands-down the lowest cost vehicle. In addition, the ability to move quicker than the Big 3 positions us well and early in the market.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/dth5em1qc0671.gif

‚úÖ Rich Schmidt, Lordstown President confirms, Lordstown is fully funded through May 2022 with millions extra in the bank. There is additional fundraising happening to ramp up production, because hard tooling requires 50-51 week advanced and paid order before required. In order to continue to improve production with hard tooling, we will continue to work with ATVM Loan funding and asset-backed funding.

‚úÖ Current interest is at an expected 20,000 non-binding orders through May 2022.

‚úÖ The hub motors have been fully tested on street driving, and we have not been able to break a hub motor. You will break a wheel before you break a hub motor. They are built very much for difficult road conditions.

‚úÖ 600 employees are hired on to support operations across Lordstown locations.

‚úÖ Received FMVSS Penetration Requirements exceeded. Final certification test will be early fourth quarter. Vehicles will be produced in September and quarantined until final certification is released, at which time the vehicles will be delivered to customers.

‚úÖ There is a Lordstown VAN prototype that is in final stages of completion completed, which will be shown this summer. The prototype is set up to use same products, build, and platforms as the Endurance.

‚úÖ The cost for the Endurance will be at $55,000. There is a minimal parts supply cost increase due to covid. The average vehicle increase has been $4,000 across the industry.

‚úÖ Vehicles will be available for press and investors to drive at Lordstown Week, onsite June 21 - 25.

‚úÖ Lordstown will continue an open culture; engaging with the team and it's up to the employees and Lordstown family to seek unionization or not... Every team member owns shares in the company, we enjoy providing free meals, and each day we work hand and hand with all Lordstown employees.

m082zn,2021-03-08 04:47:59,Don't expect GME to become worth more than the combined market cap of all other stocks on the planet,"I totally expect to wake up tomorrow with a negative karma for posting this but man it needs to be said.

The total market cap of all stocks IN THE WORLD combined is about 100 trillion.

It was cute for a bit when everyone was echoing 100k which would put GME at a market cap of 7 trillion. Personally I highly doubt this will happen and will not count on it.

But now the clamor is up to 500k which would be a third of the market cap of the world. Not going to happen.

Soon they will be calling for 1 million which would be 70 trillion almost as much as the market cap of ALL OTHER STOCKS COMBINED and about 40% more than all the stocks in the USA. That will not happen. The HFs won't physically be able to buy shares for that much.

And I don't want to hear how Berskshire A is almost 400k. They only have 1.5 million shares and make a profit of tens of billions of dollars per year. If they had the 70 mil shares that GME has it would be at only 7k.

It is only a matter of time before people are calling for 5 million or 10 million. Don't listen to them. That is nutzzzzzz. 10 mil would put market cap of GME at 700 trillion which is HALF THE NET WORTH OF PLANET EARTH. That is not going to happen. Not possible.

Here is how I see it and nothing here is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor... There s a 99% chance that I get it wrong somehow either to the upside or downside.

1k is likely.

2k is very possible

5k is possible as well but I think a bit of a reach, but it could happen for sure.

10k is a bit of a reach but still possible.

20k not likely

50k very unlikely. It would make GME worth almost double apple.

100k just not going to happen.

500k is a delusion

1 mil is just stupid wishful thinking

suggesting 5 million is going to get people hurt.

If you are counting on 100k expect to be disappointed and expect to walk away with nothing but the shares you hold forever (although I put the long term price of GME at pretty close to where it is now).

If I were to advise anyone anything it is this:

1. have a plan
2. have a plan
3. have a plan

I cannot stress the first 3 enough.

4) don't sell all at once. Most likely you did not buy all at once and the last shares you buy will most likely be the best buy (maybe not by % but by timing)

5) count on: whatever you think in terms of peak $ and peak time will probably be wrong; so plan accordingly

6) be ready to tweak plan if things start to look differently

So for now here is my plan just to give an example but you do you (as Shakespeare wrong, This above all to thine own self be true)

my first sell will probably be around 1k. I will sell probably 100 of my 220 shares (which I might turn around and buy back on a big dip). For my oldest boy's education fund I will sell about 30 of his 100. For my youngest boy sell 10 of his 50.

At 2k I sell 100 more shares keeping 20 and giving me 300k cash which I would be very happy with.

I sell 60 of my oldest boys remaining giving him 10 left and 170k in his account and 10 more years for me to raise it (lets face it 170k would put him through college...).

I sell 35 of my youngest boys giving him 5 left and 80k cash and 14 years to get him enough to go to college.

At 10k I sell all of my boys remaining shares. I sell 25 of my last 30. I hold the last 5 of my shares until I feel we are at the peak or just past the peak.

Also to note once I sell shares and have cash I will be selling puts to make some more cash. I will keep doing this until GME months from now goes back to the 50-60 range and the squeeze is over and a lot of people move on from GME. At some point I will get assigned in that range and pick up probably about 1000 shares for me and a couple of hundred for each of my boys to hold long term. I won't be able to sell puts for my boys until I get their accounts transferred to TD ameritrade.

Half the ppl on this sub don‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of moving funds, selling or transferring stock, and can‚Äôt afford account mins with other brokers. Majority of the RH haters will prolly be buying puts on $HOOD through their app lmao. 

2) Their UI is fun, feels like a casino &amp; you get a dopamine rush every time you trade, making you want to do it way too often. All the other mainstream brokers I‚Äôve tried have trash mobile UI. 

3) Hood setup well to make boatloads of cash when Uncle Sammy decides to murdered tether &amp; regulate tf outta cryptidiots. No tether expo. RH also not letting ppl withdrawal coins is right in line with how govt wants things to be. 

4) WSB sentiment has historically been an atrocious indicator of future stock performance. 95% of you losers haven‚Äôt been around before the GameStop bs, &amp; don‚Äôt remember how terrible WSB is at trading generally. Buying $HOOD is effectively shorting WSB in more ways than one which some might consider to be the best trade of all time. 

TLDR: WSB is too big &amp; still for the most part very bad at trading; Long $HOOD

Life is terrible. You work 8 hours a day, you have no friends or family, and you‚Äôre dumb as bricks. 

To you, and those around you and online, it seems like the world is failing you. You‚Äôll never own a home, you‚Äôll never retire, and even your car payment and student loans are enough to cripple any hope of having savings. After all, that‚Äôs why you gamble on the very system that keeps you perma-broke. 

You and your woke ass Instagram high school classmates (aka Wendy‚Äôs coworkers) continually post to your feed statistics of generation wealth inequality, the destruction of the middle class, and whatever else helps you rationalize being a lazy and depressed piece of shit. It‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs the system that‚Äôs broken!

After a while you might start to think about how this can keep happening. How can so many people be okay with being broke? Well the reality is, it‚Äôs probably less than you think. Or at least enough of the poors are too dumb to know any better. 

The reality is, the next golden generation is here and thriving. The baby boomers were known for having the easiest path to retirement in history, but damn gen X is making it look easy too.

Think about it. These losers have essentially no life, high paying jobs, mortgages with all time low interest rates, 401k‚Äôs that have rallied harder than Jesus on the third day, and a severe lack of personality or passion, which results in a lust to just be richer than their friends. 

We have a hoard of near retirees who work, spend money, and eat unseasoned chicken with roasted potatoes their whole life. A whole generation of buffets balls deep in the markets, who have rightfully been rewarded for their patience. The kicker is, these idiots won‚Äôt even retire as they wouldn‚Äôt know what to do with themselves if they did. 

These people are the consumers keeping things afloat, and they aren‚Äôt going anywhere. As long as these people are buying new cars every 3 years, going out to eat 5 times a week, going on 2 vacations a year, and buying all the new tech in the world for their 20 something year old degenerate kids, things are going to be just fine. so stop waiting around for a crash that you only think will happen because your poor. The US economy is going to stay strong for way longer than you can imagine.

Then in 2022, he decided to buy out Twitter which hurt investors quite a bit. Dude even said fuk off to Bob Iger. Started beef with Apple, Bill Gates, and JP Morgan. He said if the result of free speech is losing money then be it.

This dude doesn't give an F about investors for reasons listed above.

Now, today, he changed his tone. He said ""if Tesla executes extremely well over the next 5 years, the long-term value could exceed Apple and Aramco combined"". Sound like he begging people to buy Tesla now. Why tf did he suddenly make these bullish comments about the stocks lmao?

Looking at the price action, Tesla is getting shorted almost every day, and investors are losing interest. But from his statement, it sounds like he wants us to hold the bags for 5 years. But his comments was very precise, which can be hard to sue if that doesn't happen.

But the last time he sound bullish like this, he dumped a bunch of shares of his followers lmao. This dude can't be trusted. I would love to be bullish on Tesla if Elon just stfu, and not making any political comments and get alone with everyone.

My good friend is a financial banker at a very big hedge fund (can't reveal the name for security reasons of course) and I was able to secretly record him breaking down the hedge fund trading algorithm (spoiler: there are factorials and exponentials involved! very complex math) and I KID you not, at the heart of the whole equation was GME. Video link in comments below

At first I didn't even understand how the hell that even makes sense, but this goddamn whistleblower explained it perfectly the farther into the video you go. GME is a HOT buy at an amazing discount and this is coming from someone on the inside.

Super helpful in this video how he explains why GME is a great stock using simple geometry. Keep in mind, taking factorials and converting them to geometric sequences isn't something just any man can do. This involves critical thinking and machine learning.

oq4q1q,2021-07-23 15:27:20,Fasten your seatbelts. Massive market crash is incoming next week and it‚Äôs going to be worse than the 2008 housing crash! üìâüí•,"Now that I got your attention, I‚Äôm thinking there is going to be a (possibly major) correction mid-way next week.

**FA:**

FOMC meeting is on July 28 and they will be, yet again, discussing fiscal and monetary policies. Fed funds rate could remain at <=0.25% or bump up. The rise in fed fund rate is pretty unlikely as JPow communicated that QE slowdown will precede interest rate hikes, but there's a good chance that tapering will be further discussed. US exports have climbed back to precovid numbers, US imports are higher than ever before despite DXY getting slapped meanwhile the GDP target has risen for 2021 signaling a sooner than anticipated economic recovery. Not to mention the continuous MoM CPI climbs in absurd amounts and the US operating at a massive trade deficit, all signal that tapering may start in the very near term despite JPow repeating how far we are from the economic target. However, officials have echoed on numerous fronts, the interest rate is not expected to see a hike until 2023; although, they predict that tapering plans will be announced in Fall of this year, but with everything seeming to go back to status quo sooner than expected, tapering or other bearish monetary policies could be announced and implemented shortly.

Tech earnings week is fast approaching. It‚Äôs unlikely the prices will hold when tech stocks sit at all time highs and the ER forecast for blue chips remain stagnant compared to its previous quarters.

**TA:**

TA says we‚Äôre reaching upper level resistance. Volatility is extremely high on the upside and can trigger HFT or quant funds to reduce inventory. We can expect higher levels of volatility (VIX futures that is only 1 week dte trading at roughly 20% from current levels).

[Reaching critical trend line resistance. Consider QQQ to have a upside of +1&#37; from here at $370\~$371](https://preview.redd.it/2pp016pjbzc71.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=3248a4a2286ac3add6b4a7351682104e2ff5a773)

EWT says we‚Äôre reaching the massive correction cycle. It's the same shit when it comes to tech earnings run-up followed by the dump in spite of a decent performance.

Uncertainty creates risk and risk drives fear so the fact that ER release (granted a beat) by the blue chips might not be large enough to justify current prices, or the possible sector rotation that may ensue post ER release, or the possible tapering discussion which may change the macro, or reaching the upper level resistance of a major trend line could scare smart money away from the equity market in the near term. Call it quad witching if you will.

**QQQ ETF weighting/ER Date:** 

* AAPL - 13.39%/July 28 
* MSFT - 10.76%/July 27 
* AMZN - 10.66%/July 28

15bitm7,2023-07-28 00:49:24,$DISH is extremely undervalued,"So I got into $DISH because of the Dish guy on here a few days ago, but before buying into it, I wanted to make sure it was a good company and I wasn't buying into trash. 

I've bought into FRC, AMC, WISH, SOS, TLRY, RAD and many other meme stocks here, so it's fair to say I'm regarded and I've made and lost a lot of money on my stupid plays but I have told myself I am done playing stupid and I need to invest in better companies. 

So despite the news of Dish selling phone plans on Amazon, I looked at their balance sheet, and I feel this is one of the most undervalued companies on the market. 

Because many regards here don't look at the balance sheet, let's take a close look. 

As of last quarter they have

Cash on hand: $2.54B

Total long term debt: $20.53B

Total liabilities: $35.38B

Total assets $56.562B

Total Shareholder Equity: $18.183B (AFTER debt)

Current market cap: $3.72B

In the last year, they've made over 5 billion in profit, as a failing company, their total profit is less than the market cap of the company. How often do you find a company that has made over 5 billion, offers over 18B in book value, trading for under 4 billion? it's a steal.

A lot of that debt has been added over the last few years as they've built out their 5G network to compete with other providers along with purchasing Boost Mobile from Sprint for $1.4 billion.

As you can see even with what customer base is left after all the cord cutting, and now with the new Amazon deal, they are still a very profitable company. They are trading as if they are going to spiral into bankruptcy, but as of right now unless something changes, they are a profitable company that is able to pay all its debts, on top of that, even if shareholder equity was only $10 billion, it's still trading at 3 times less than it should be, the book value as of right now is over 18 billion, yet it's trading at 3.72B, it's a steal. 

I also believe that this is a trial period of Amazon selling their Sim cards and cell phone services through their website, if Amazon sees that they are selling well and doing well through Amazon, I believe Dish will have a good chance of being acquired by Amazon, but I believe Amazon wants to see how well they do first before taking that leap, but even if they do, Amazon would be buying a profitable company, that they could integrate into their own services with Prime Video and a 5G network already built out as most of the leg work has already been done.

Even if Amazon never acquires them and that isn't the play (which I totally believe will happen eventually) the big play here is this, they are still a very profitable company, they realize that they are losing customers at a rapid pace on their Dish network services and they've noticed it for a while, so now they are trying to transition to a cell phone provider while they still are making money from their satellite company to roll this transition out.

Lastly, I do expect a decent earnings here as their last earnings was a disaster with over 552,000 people that left due to a cyberattack that left their entire network down for a week, I believe there will be some decline in the satellite division, but I also expect them to push their new cell phone and 5G net work as the future of the company, as even if they were to sell the network they built out alone with 5G, it would be worth more than the debt and 3.72B market cap this is currently trading at. I believe people will finally see the value that they are bringing to the table and the stock will jump to the $10-12 range. 

The IV is also higher on the call side than put side, and it's been that way for a bit, so I think even the hedge funds know this is undervalued and expect it to go higher. 

I could be wrong, so do your own DD. I'm holding through earnings and jumping ship if I am wrong. 

Position 7,400 shares - yes I'm a bag holder but my DD stands, and I know when to cut my losses, so troll me if you want lol

tl:dr - Dish Network is undervalued, they are transitioning into a new industry and already built a lot of the 5G network out to over 240 million Americans (70% of the population) that alone would be worth it for Amazon or some other big player to purchase off of them. The company isn't going bankrupt, but they're being priced as they are.

tc30wh,2022-03-11 23:24:48,"The DRS/direct registration/switch from street name to record name ""movement"" is a bonafide Reddit Moment.","I am a corporate lawyer. I represent public companies. I have watched from the side lines as you all have talked for the last year or so about how revolutionary you are being by demanding the transfer agents of the companies in which you own stock move your shares from the street names of your brokers to your own registered names at AST, ComputerShare, EQ (pre-merger) etc. Here is an example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb1b6w/checkmate\_wall\_street/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb1b6w/checkmate_wall_street/) 

My impression has been, wow, these people really have no idea how absolutely insignificant this move is to the brokers weighed against the negative effects it is likely to have on their companies, whose expenses for administering this increased number of registered SHs are going to go up substantially.

Now I'm starting to see the rubber meet the road. This week I saw the first invoices from Broadridge for annual meeting services this year, which are up 35-65% for  my clients because their registered shareholder pool has gone up by, depending on the client, hundreds/thousands of individuals/entities because of your ""movement."" I guess you don't realize that for every new registered shareholder, the company has to pay like $1,000 extra each year to Broadridge for searches, report tabulation, voting, mailing proxy statements and cards, mailing annual reports, etc. not to mention many issuers are now exceeding the limits of the transfer agent contracts so they are paying per SH out the ass to AST/Computershare. I am seeing company's annual meeting bills and transfer agent quarterly invoices go up by $100,000s for absolutely no reason. I can only imagine how crazy the transfer agent/Broadridge bills are this year for a true meme stock like GME; I assume at least $1 million.

I really have no skin in this game other than the solvency of my clients so they can pay my invoices and I don't really care either way really except I think it's funny to point out that by taking this untutored stance against your brokers who, trust me, don't give a shit whether your 23 GME shares are on their books or AST's, you are actually costing the companies you are trying to long literally hundreds of thousands of dollars for basically no reason (not to mentioned the poor beleagured stock administration teams at your portfolio companies who are like, ""wait, what someone wants to hold 7 shares at AST, that's like 20 minutes of paperwork I didn't need or want to add to my plate"").

In other words, you played yourself.

Stop living in denial for two fucking seconds and listen. The ONLY reason GME got as high as it did was because of the media. It was portrayed as a ‚ÄúDavid vs Goliath‚Äù story which started a buying frenzy that everyone wanted to be a part of. I know you dipshits don‚Äôt understand how the stock market works but I‚Äôm sure you can understand simple supply and demand. 

Look at the chart. You can literally see the day it became national news, and like most things, it was viral for a few days followed by NO ONE GIVING A SHIT EVER AGAIN.

So that‚Äôs it. Here we are with GME back to reasonable volume, backpedaling it‚Äôs way to a more reasonable value. If you have shares you have two choices, hold because you think the return from this point will be stronger than other investments, or sell because you think it won‚Äôt.

If you do hold, you need to realize it will be a while. You need to stop constantly checking the price, stop telling yourself you will wake up tomorrow and see it at +100%, stop coming on here looking to confirm your beliefs. Find something else to do to occupy your time before you lose your mind.

Let‚Äôs face it, GME isn‚Äôt going to the moon anytime soon. The short sellers and market makers can replicate as many share IOUs as they want to keep up with any retail buyer demand. And since the stock isn‚Äôt paying dividends, and the company‚Äôs revenue is going down the toilet, there‚Äôs really no big downside to them doing so. Maybe Ryan Cohen could turn around the company someday, but that could take years.

Anyways I‚Äôd like to see this sub return to its roots. Ban all the newcomers especially people who only talk about GME. Anyone else agree? There‚Äôs more stocks to invest in than GME, many of them more promising and with higher upside.

CenturyLink (LUMN) Lumen Technologies has been selected to help Nebraska transition onto their next generation 911 emergency system. By using this next generation emergency system it will help improve the delivery of emergency calls by not only allowing residences to voice call but also allowing them to send text messages, videos and pictures to emergency responders.

# CenturyLink signed 5 year contract with Nebraska Public Service Commission

They signed a contract with the State of Nebraska Public Service Commission which establishes a statewide Emergency Services Internet Protocol Network (ESInet) that serves approximately 70 PSAPs, with the goal of having all seven PSAP regions connected to the ESInet by the end of 2022. The contract, which Lumen had won previously, has an initial term of five years with five one-year options

# NG911 Features

Lumen's enhancements to its NG911 platform will provide new customers with a portal featuring a customer management dashboard with access to:

* a real-time view of the health of customer NG911 systems;
* the call path from origination through delivery to the public safety answering point (PSAP);
* component level monitoring, status, inventory and diagnosis; and
* reporting metrics.

kil4wu,2020-12-23 03:31:07,GME short squeeze is a myth that assumes massive incompetence from people that actually know what they are doing.,"So with GME running the myth of the inevitable short squeeze has popped up again.  In order for this to happen a ton of people need to short the stock naked.  Which among competent investors is really fucking rare.  I will walk through it below but you can also click this link:

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp

For example let‚Äôs assume you wanted to short GME today at $20 a share.  So you sell 100 shares short at $20 each.  With a naked short you have unlimited losses as the stock runs up.  Nobody who knows what the fuck they are doing is going to do that when you can hedge to cap that loss.  A single January 21 call at a strike of 21 had a high of 2.42 today would hedge that just fine.

You short the shares and buy the call.  Your break even is now 17.68 on your short but your max loss is now $342 without borrowing costs assuming it closes at $20.99 on expiry.  Call expiring worthless for loss of $242 and $99 to cover the short.  

Borrowing costs on 100 shares at 20% and stock at 20 is about $1 a day.  Assuming everything is held to expiry with the January expiry would be about $25.

So max loss regardless of how high the stock goes is less than $400.

Your break even is kind of ass but that‚Äôs because you are protected until mid Jan.  However if IV is particularly high, even if the stock goes down pushing your return on the short up, the call might still retain enough value that your break even is much higher.  

If it‚Äôs a short term play which a short on today would likely be, you could buy a call for Friday which had a high of 1.15 today which puts your break even at 18.85 assuming you hold until Friday at close.  Factoring in borrowing cost it‚Äôs 18.8.  

That‚Äôs a hedged short which likely the vast , vast majority of GME shorts are.  Have you not noticed how fucking expensive relatively speaking call options are even with the spikes. A 20c at close with 1.5 days to expiry had a break even at 20.72 with a volume of 30,000.  Now part of that is people buying lottos but a ton of that is covering shorts.

So the whole premise of there are millions of shares that are short at $5 or $7 is some serious bullshit.  Yes there were 70m shares short give or take 2m at the end of October and there were the same number of shares short at the end of November.  This does not mean they are the same fucking people shorting it. Some have covered, some executed hedges and others have sold that shit short at higher prices.

For example today alone 8m shares were shorted.

https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme

Yesterday there were 3m shares shorted.  Borrowing rates are in the 20% range, which works out to around $1 total per 100 shares.  Or a single fucking tick downward.  So no institutions aren‚Äôt going to be covering shares they shorted at $15 when it spikes to $19.

But why has it been spiking if it‚Äôs not a short squeeze, and that‚Äôs really fucking simple, a ton of people are playing the momentum on it.  Hell 10% of the daily thread is people spamming to buy shares and you can make some money provided you don‚Äôt buy the top.  Its not a coincidence that they announce the stimulus and the stock spiked and I would be willing to bet that the vast majority of shares bought today were through Robinhood.

But Cohen you say?  He added another 3%, yeah he added 3% directly on the dip after earnings.  He‚Äôs in at $12 - $13 range based off the timings of the 13d.  If you are wondering what happens if he decides that the board isn‚Äôt being accommodating enough and drops his shares look at what happened the day Buffet said he was dropping airlines.  He can eat the ride down to $13 and still be profitable.

Then finally the biggest piece to the short squeeze is long term positive catalysts, the last significant short squeeze came from ACB two earnings ago when they closed the gap on their loss and cancelled their at the money offering.  At that point the long term growth story fundamentally changed as did the state of the business.  That‚Äôs what it takes to force a short squeeze, doubling e-commerce sales when overall sales are still massively down isn‚Äôt going to cut it.  A slightly green quarter during the launch of multiple new consoles isn‚Äôt going to do it either.  Now if they follow that with another solidly profitable quarter in May, at that point a squeeze is possible.


TL:DR:  The infinite short squeeze on GameStop is a bullshit argument assuming basic competence from anyone shorting the stock.  Options were in fact originally designed to offset the risks of shorting.  It will go up as long as more people are willing to become bagholders, just don‚Äôt be shocked when it comes crashing down.  It also explains the crazy ass high IV on call options.",0,0.41,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kil4wu/gme_short_squeeze_is_a_myth_that_assumes_massive/,wallstreetbets

I work in small molecule drug development, trying to find new drugs for new biology to treat old diseases. It's far worse than a search for a needle in a haystack. More like a molecule of water in an ocean. Most drug companies will start by screening millions and millions of molecules followed by an intensive drug optimization campaign to mitigate liabilities like hepato- and renal-tox, ion channel inhibition, protein binding, bioavailability, etc. You often wind up (after spending ~$50 million dollars) with thousands of different chemicals from which you are lucky to get one. If you want a good example of what a very successful drug looks like, here's Lipitor:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atorvastatin

Meanwhile, Cassava did none of that. If you look at their original patents from the early 2000s, they were looking for something that would work in the opioid pathway. They screened nothing, and somehow magicked simufilam out of thin air. There was no optimization, no intensive toxicology screening. No orthogonal binding assays. There is no x-ray crystal structure of where it binds. All of this to say - they have nothing. None of the data that even a first year graduate student would ask about. Just look at the molecule!
 https://www.medchemexpress.com/simufilam.html
It's a greasy little turd with more chemical liabilities than you could shake a stick at. The mere idea that this could have a pM affinity is laughable when the most potent drugs on the market are 1000 times less potent. 
Anyone with a year of medicinal chemistry experience is laughing at the suckers buying this stock.

oma9s6,2021-07-17 18:52:57,In response to the idiot who decided to make a post shitting on Realtors yesterday...,"[Here is the post for reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olqhjh/zillow_is_aiming_to_kill_real_estate_agents/)

So let me get this straight.. You are bitching about people trying to make a living on 6% (not actually 6%, I'll cover that in just a minute) of the sale of your home but you are just fine with paying 15%/20% taxes on a long-term sale or up to 37% taxes on a short term sale to a government that just pisses away our tax dollars..? I believe you have the gun pointed at the wrong people here first off....

Now back to that 6%. Since the OP of the post I'm referencing is obviously very ignorant to the profession they are attempting to condemn, let me shine some light on how this shit works. No Realtor ever sees that full 6%. Ever.

Let me try to smooth-brain this for you: When you list your home with a Realtor and agree to pay the 6% commission, once that house sells that 6% gets split 4 ways. Yup. 4 ways. 3% gets SPLIT between the listing brokerage and the agent who actually listed the home (how did you think brokerages make money and stay open..?) and the other 3% gets SPLIT between the buyer's agent and that agent's brokerage. Since most of these splits are commonly 50/50 (there are certainly areas of our nation where the split is even less favorable to the agent), the agent who you're trying to bitch about getting 6% is actually getting roughly 1.5% once all the money is divided up.

So to sum this up, when you pay 6% on the sale of your home, your money is not going to one person's pocket and making them mega-rich like everyone apparently thinks. Your money is helping to keep 2 separate businesses running and also helping two individuals pay their bills.

And don't even get me started about the monopoly Zillow is attempting to run so they can control the prices of our housing market nationwide. Zillow (who owns Trulia, DotLoop,  HotPads,  Buyfolio,  ShowingTime, Postlets,  Diverse Solutions, RentJuice,  Mortech, StreetEasy,  Retsly, Naked Apartments,  & Bridge Interactive) is a growing cancer attempting to not only oust Realtors, but Mortgage Lenders and Property Managers as well nationwide.

Stop being so ignorant about this profession before your blind ignorance comes back to haunt you.

And thank a Realtor the next time you see one.

EDIT: No one is making you use a Realtor at the end of the day, so for those of you who feel they aren't worth a damn, just don't use one. But I made this post in defense of Realtors from being bashed and misunderstood as people who take all your money and do nothing since everyone seems to think they pocket the full 6%. That is a lie. Anyone is free to list their house on their own, and of course you're free to use Zillow or any other platform to assist you, just keep in mind this silver lining:  When you choose to use Zillow, they aren't legally bound to provide you accurate information. They have disclaimers galore that keep them from being responsible when you make a stupid decision based on the info they provide. A Realtor has skin in the game; they are legally bound to provide nothing but accurate info and if they don't they can be sued. But go ahead, give up your right to have someone assist you that has skin in the game and go for the companies that could give a shit less if you just made the biggest financial mistake of your life off inaccurate info they provided you.

Ok, so commodities were going up in price due to excess demand and limited supply. But now the global recovery will be slowed due to Omicron. European and Asian countries are already going into lockdown, and banning travel to/from the UK.

With some European countries, like the Netherlands, implementing strict only essentials stores may be open. (I hope we don't bring back the term essential workers). 
The scheduled closure of various facilities are:

- Schools until Jan 9.
- Bars, restaurants, gyms, hairdressers until Jan. 14th
- Wider measures until Jan. 22

I'm sure you're all aware of that Joe Manchin torpedoed the $2T BBB (Build back Better) plan. This could be bullish and decrease aggregate demand. I don't blame him, for saying no, they added too much pork.

Really, there are always permabears saying it's going to finally correct or crash or whatever, and the Big Short has not helped things as now everyone wants to be a Michael Burry and call a new top. I've been a small time RE investor for a bit now, physical property not stock. So I've always got my ear to the state of RE value and trends, and I'm generally bullish on it as it is a protected asset class that the state insists on propping up and becomes generally more scarce due to regulatory creep. But for the time being, I think the dump is finally coming within the next half-year.

1. For once, the Fed is actually working against the housing market. They quite literally are trying to induce some kind of correction by yanking up interest rates to their highest levels in 25+ years. So there are no smoke and mirrors financing policies that can toss them a lifeboat right now.
2. As many have heard, the effective monthly mortgage payment is basically at its highest point ever, by a huge margin. The cost to own has surged past the cost to rent. We're talking 50+% in under a year for the same priced home, and as home values rocketed during COVID QE there is now nowhere to go but down in order to meet demand.
3. Demand has been frozen, this is known by all in the industry. While values have only flatlined the industry itself (RE agents, mortgage personnel) are in recession as transactions are simply not happening. So why have values only treaded water rather than dumping?
4. Supply has simply not been there. Historically low supply. Literally just not enough houses to cause any sort of market panic or crash. People still need to buy homes to live in, and for the time being sellers have found a buyer for their price, eventually, just not as quickly as 2021-2022.

With all of these factors in mind, consider a few things just happened:

Home values have double topped and are on the downswing [https://ycharts.com/indicators/us\_existing\_home\_median\_sales\_price](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_existing_home_median_sales_price)

and more critically:

[US housing supply is finally soaring back to levels unseen since the great housing crash of 2007](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSACSR)

Frozen demand is finally starting to meet a glut of supply, and mortgage rates have remained largely unchanged, still the most expensive time to buy a house in American history. Commercial RE has already been in hell and a foreclosure crunch is expected. Probabilities markets predict that the Fed will be cutting rates within the next half-year, where they accurately assessed the rate hikes prior. This means the expectation from people with actual money (not idiotic talking heads with no stakes), is that a recession and dovish pivot is on the agenda next.

I'm personally betting on at least a small housing crash this year and loading up on some puts to hedge my portfolio. Feel free to call me stupid :-)",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1906fy6/the_housing_market_is_finally_going_to_dump_soon/,wallstreetbets

137xdvm,2023-05-04 19:32:02,How dumb are some of y‚Äôall?,"Im only talking about the handful of y‚Äôall that are hoping for more bank failures.  Why are y‚Äôall hoping more banks fail?  First of all, if the banks all end up failing, the government can easily say, ‚ÄúWell I guess CBDC‚Äôs are our only option.‚Äù  Do y‚Äôall really want that?

Another thing is that people actually work for these banks.  When you are rooting for a bank to fail, you‚Äôre not just rooting for the top executives to lose their jobs but also countless customer service reps, tellers, branch managers, IT employees, janitors, and other people to lose their jobs.  You‚Äôre also rooting for people to lose their money that they have invested in these banks.  

You may not realize it, but you probably have money invested in these banks.  Vanguard, Schwab, iShares, Fidelity, and other companies have some of these regional banks in different ETF‚Äôs.  Also, a significant chunk of bank stocks make up at least 16% of the Russel 2000 (the S&P has a significantly lower percentage).  If banks keep failing, it is going to end up costing the FDIC a lot of money and guess where that money comes from?  Either more taxes (they say it will only be banks affected, yeah right) or by printing more money.

pa33xi,2021-08-23 16:15:52,The Great Unwinding: Why Cash Is Still King and Boomers Will (Once Again) Steal Your Wealth,"Time for some hot bear smut, but this isn‚Äôt your usual flavor of doom and gloom. Also, I‚Äôll try to not sound like ‚ÄúDavid‚Äù in the following.

You. You are an individual. As an individual, you are a basic economic unit. As a basic economic unit, you are responsible for contributing economic activity, managing your personal resources, and maximizing utility. Utility means two things in being a productive member of society AND by being content with your lifestyle. This has been studied for generations and is taught as personal finance or even home economics.

As an individual or a family, it is in your best interest to ensure you have adequate liquidity. This liquidity will allow you to meet your short term financial obligations and even your long term financial obligations. Most people talk about an emergency find which should be 6 months to 1 year of your complete living expenses. For most adults in the U.S. this figure is a minimum of $30,000 per individual in cash, either physical or in a checking account that can be quickly accessed. Most of you probably do not have these resources available. If you do not, then you should immediately stop gambling and save every red cent.

At the time of this writing, the total value of the US stock market was approximately 100 Trillion USD...maybe more. However, the total circulating supply of USD in the world was approximately 20.4 Trillion USD. That means that 80% of the total stock market value is illusory and nonexistent. This is why during 2008 and 2020 there was such a run on financial markets. Everyone was cashing in to get raw cash! The problem then, and the problem now, is that there isn‚Äôt enough money to go around. When the next market meltdown happens, it will be far more pronounced as everyone tries to convert their funny money assets into real money. This is one of the reasons why there is such a growing disparity between the rich and the poor. The poor give their money to the rich and then wonder why they are poor. 

Anyway, everyone knows that stock prices are super overvalued, bond prices are super overvalued, real estate is super overvalued. The only thing that is not yet overvalued, is USD.

https://preview.redd.it/a5bx2k3qr4j71.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=dad697253b5a9eba7a28172cc27600faf853dbcd

If you are less than 30 years old, you do not get to have an opinion on inflation or the value of the USD. You simply have not lived enough to know what the fuck you‚Äôre talking about. Period. All of the ‚Äúprecious‚Äù metal bugs are getting their shit pushed in by JPow‚Äôs green dildo. There is inflation, but it‚Äôs in every asset class from bond prices, stonk prices, and real estate prices‚Ä¶not in cash. Cash is the only thing with intrinsic value because that is what we all use as a medium of exchange. It‚Äôs also what each and every one of us care about at the end of the day. Period. Every other asset is only made up of extrinsic value nowadays which is why meme stocks have been in the the driver seat. Finally, the only way the USD will stop being of any value is if the United States collapses. If that happens, you will have bigger personal issues to deal with than literally ALL of your assets going to 0. Moving on.

Boomers hold most of the wealth in the United States. They also have most of their wealth tied up in the stock market and real estate market. Most boomers will be retiring en masse and as they do retire, they will be converting their mutual funds and stocks into cold hard cash. This will have a ripple effect that will make equity prices go down. While you‚Äôre stuffing real money into the slot machines of the stock market casino, boomers are gleefully taking that money from you and putting it in their pockets. The boomers didn‚Äôt take your money‚Ä¶you gave it to them. Further, as they begin retiring, and they have already begun, they will keep taking your money as they sell their shares to you.

&#x200B;

Also, look at the velocity of money. The velocity of money has been in decline since the GFC and has dropped from 10.6 in 2008 all the way down to 1.18 in 2021. Shit is going to get crazy as the real economy is still fucked and there will be a reckoning soon. Soon means anywhere from a few weeks to a few years. Nobody has a crystal ball but anyone that looks around can see it. Make no mistake, it IS coming. Make sure you are properly positioned so you don‚Äôt get fucking rekt when it does. You recently saw how the market sold off over 1% last week at just the hint of the Fed talking about thinking about tapering asset purchases. That doesn‚Äôt even address the fed funds rate. Interest rates will have to go up soon. When they do, even by .25%, it will make EVERYTHING lose value. Burry was right when he called this the greatest speculative bubble of all time and that the market is dancing on a knife‚Äôs edge. Do not let yourself get fucked by the idiocy of those in power.

IDGAF what you think about this, because at the end of the day, YOU and YOU ALONE have to live with yourself and your personal circumstances. It‚Äôs no skin off my ass if I see you on a street corner begging for change. I‚Äôve already met some of you who‚Äôve YOLO‚Äôd it all right into homelessness. I warned you. If this saves one idiot from gambling their live savings away on this negative sum game, then that is enough for me.

https://preview.redd.it/cenmhgatt4j71.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=66a1ab0ead88b290b06c5a9409084701a6a17b06

Takeaways: sell all your shit now and convert it all into USD. Hold it in money market funds or your checking account. As long as you have quick access to it for use in your personal life. If you have dependents, then get the fuck off of WSB and get your family financially prepared. I‚Äôve seen too many deadbeat dads on here who have financially ruined their families. Don‚Äôt be that guy. If you‚Äôre single, then make sure you don‚Äôt have to move back in with mom n‚Äô dad. Take care of your shit.

Also, make sure your career is stable and unfuck yourself if you‚Äôre on a PIP or something. Find a new job because right now wages and salaries are higher and it‚Äôs a bull market for job seekers. Start a business or a side hustle, with bonus points if it targets boomers and their wealth.

Positions: 90% USD and 10% in brokerage account to gamble on OTM options. Most I can ever lose is 10% of my wealth. 

TLDR: Cash out your retirement, cash out your stonks, bonds, and everything. DUMP IT before Boomers do it first. Cash is still king and you will need the liquidity to personally weather the storm during the coming crisis. Only gamble 10% of your total net worth in risky stonks or options at any given time. DO NOT YOLO. Gambling on the stock market is fine as long as you‚Äôre using money that you can literally afford to lose. e.g. no more than 10% of your net worth at any given point\*.

\*Don‚Äôt use the 10% rule as an excuse to chop yourself up into bits before ending up broke. This means if you‚Äôre only worth $10,000 then the most you can gamble is $1,000. If you lose it, then you‚Äôre done until you save another $1,000 to then gamble. It does not mean lose $1,000, then take 10% of $9,000. Again, this is all on you. If you fuck yourself then you have to live with it, not me.",55,0.56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pa33xi/the_great_unwinding_why_cash_is_still_king_and/,wallstreetbets
18tpf0u,2023-12-29 15:18:26,ARM is Worth $1000 - Everything Runs On ARM - What Doesn't WILL - 10 Year Play - X86 is DEAD,"[ARM](https://www.arm.com/) is setup for success, hear me out. ARM Powers billions of devices and will power more. Why? Compute power per watt and cost.

* ARM is in over 99% of smartphones
   * you will have to upgrade to get all the new AI features and services that will come out.
* Apple is 100% ARM in all of their products (except that one trash can desktop thing but...)
* Apple will release an AI powered device that will need new hardware with new ARM NPU chips to power the on device AI
* Every other device that comes out that wants to use GAI/AI/Inference will run on ARM
* VR devices that are portable run on ARM
* ARM runs on EV's and Cars in general
* IoT runs on ARM
* ARM runs on smart [toilets](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/application/industrial/building-home-automation/smart-toilet#overview)
* ARM runs on your [refrigerator](https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/4-door-flex/28-cu-ft--4-door-flex-with-21-5-in-connected-touch-screen-family-hub-refrigerator-rf28n9780sg-aa/)
* ARM runs on your Television
* ARM runs on smart watches
* GPU's that need compute and cuda core busing runs on ARM
* Microsoft runs on ARM
* Google runs on ARM
* AWS Graviton runs on ARM

ARM is the silicon designer for anyone who wants a custom designed chip for their hardware use case.

Forget everything you knew about ARM pricing and EPS based on historical records. The new new pricing royalties and actual collection of profits from new and innovative design will come into their revenues.

They don't make hardware, instead they will design and get a cut from almost every device you can think of.

The AI boom stands to benefit them in new ways as AI devices that will require low power and less/no heat to run will be a vital aspect of all devices coming into the future.

Yes Intell is a competitor but like most intel products that have come out they are slow to move and come out with inferior products. Look at their GPU lineup (why did they even do anything if you were going to do something so benign).

RISCV is a competitor that is arguing open source but let's get real here. They are requiring royalties too and the IP now stands with ARM and will increasingly stand with ARM.

Is ARM a trillion dollar company in 10 years? I say yes, easily. Mark my words.

They will continue delivering custom chips more and more and more and they will be mostly, if not all, through the ARM and NPU chipset designs.

The future is bright for ARM. Get in on the ground floor now.

What makes ARM so amazing? Compute power per watt and heat transfer. It's why your new Macbooks don't have full blowing old school fans that are running to cool down your pc every 2 minutes. The fan is not even directly on the chip die. Microsoft will soon release all of their Surface lineup on ARM going forward. Mark my words. They have to compete with Apple and Apple is ahead on this. Increasingly, all of Azure data centers will increasingly run on ARM because it's cheaper and more cost effective.

It's compute that is specific for the actual use case. Not the x86 legacy use case of trying to run on and do everything. It's(x86) is not power efficient and power efficiency is ultra important to hardware processes rather than trying to have a chip that does everything but only needs to do 1 or 2 things.

ARM specializes in designing microprocessors, SoC (System on Chip) solutions, and related technologies. They develop the architecture and designs for various types of processors, including those used in smartphones, tablets, embedded systems, and increasingly in servers and desktops.

1bfglam,2024-03-15 15:26:34,Unpopular opinion: I am bullish on Reddit IPO & stock,"While I'm snacking on my box of crayons, let me tell you a bit about what I've been observing. There's a lot of hate for the Reddit IPO and people predicting its inevitable demise. These people are wrong. Most of this comes from people just not wanting change - because lets face it, we're all on Reddit, and it's basically the last refuge on the internet for some of the 'oldschool internet' crowd.

Now lets look at some of the other social media networks out there. What do you think is the average age of the typical SNAP / INSTA / TIKTOK user compared to Reddit? Now look at their valuations. SNAP is 20BB. Meta is 1.2T. Reddit's IPO is being priced at 5.XB.

Now lets think about Reddit's product - which is the users. We, on average, are going to be older, and therefore have a higher net worth, more higher level jobs, etc. As an advertising audience, we are a much more valuable product compared to the kids sexting on SNAP. If SNAP is worth 20B, Reddit is going to reach at LEAST that level in a year. Yea, unfortunately it means there will probably be more ads, but hopefully they won't fuck it up to the point where the users bail - and lets face it, there isn't really anywhere else for us to go.

So yea, I'm bullish on Reddit. I've got my IPO allocation in. If you had aren't buying at IPO prices, then you belong here with the best regards.",0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bfglam/unpopular_opinion_i_am_bullish_on_reddit_ipo_stock/,wallstreetbets
leram1,2021-02-07 17:46:27,Blatant Mistakes in Almost All of WSB's DD Over the Past Week,"There have been quite a few posts over the past 2 weeks claiming some absurd things with very little proof. 






Almost all of these posts make huge mistakes that debunk their whole argument. It's really unfortunate to read an essay of what the OP claims is DD and then realizing that the OP didn't spend 5 minutes making sure the claims he's making make sense or are accurate. So here is my attempt to debunk the big posts. I won't be spending too much time on any one post. Usually the posts have dozens of little mistakes and addressing them all will take hours. So I'll just cover the main problem of each.  






**Number 1: ""15 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight)""**




>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laferl/15_usca_78i_the_illegality_of_short_ladder/





This is the biggest thread about it but any post the mentions a ""short ladder attack"", ""ladder attack"", or ""short attack"" fall into this. ""Short ladder attacks"" and ""ladder attacks"" are NOT real and are not a term you see anywhere other than WSB and a single SeekingAlpha post by a crazy person. Short attacks are real but literally everyone on WSB is using the word incorrectly. It means something completely different from how it's being used.




This is what a short attack is:







>https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/11/27/short-activism-the-rise-in-anonymous-online-short-attacks/











>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp 






Just shorting a stock a lot is NOT a short attack. Actual examples of short attacks are Citron's ""research"" which scares investors into selling their stock. You can even view Bill Ackman's short of Herbalife as an attempted short attack since he was public about it which made investors fearful (temporarily). This has not occurred with GME recently. Obviously Citron was shorting it for a bit but the claims of short attacks have been much more recent than that. None of these claims talk about what was occurring weeks ago with Citron because when they say ""short attack"" they mean something completely different from the actual definition. 





Also, the trading strategy that people talk about when mentioning a ""short ladder attack"" or ""ladder attack"" does NOT even work. Think about for even a second. For this type of price manipulation to happen you need either do it to a stock with almost no volume or you need to trade enough to be responsible for almost all the volume. For the last 2 weeks the lowest daily volume for GME has been 40 million. With many days having a volume double that. So, the first possibility is out. The second possibility assumes that hedge fund are willing to trade BILLIONS of dollars of stock back and forth on a daily basis. That makes 0 sense but let's say that's true just for the argument. The goal of this supposed strategy is to artificially lower the price. Most hedge funds did not short GME and have no reason to allow this strategy to happen. If BILLIONS (or millions) of dollars of the stock are traded at artificially low then the rest of Wall Street would just buy these shares and make a profit. Thus, moving the price back to equilibrium. It is impossible to manipulate a stock price with this strategy if the volume is this big. 






**Number 2: ""GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze""**






>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/








>I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. ~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.








I've already explained what short attacks mean so this is a perfect example of a completely incorrect usage of the word.









~~Also, the site the OP linked shows shares that are available TO BE borrowed. It does not show when shared ARE borrowed. So, it actually shows the opposite of what OP thought it did. Which means his whole argument is incorrect since it depended on this to make any sense.~~





~~I go more in depth about that here:~~
~~https://ns.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/le7syu/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float/gmaru31/~~



**EDIT #4 - 7PM: The second part of my argument is incorrect. I assumed the website worked in a way that it doesn't. I only realized this after tinkering a bunch. If you're interested in exactly why I was confused here's a link to a discussion I had which made me realize my mistake:** 



https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmixka6/






**Number 3: ""Why $GME short interest appears to have fallen when in reality it has not.""**







>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lag1d3/why_gme_short_interest_appears_to_have_fallen/







Short interest does not change when short-sellers hedge with options. Short interest is the number of shares sold short divided by the number of shares outstanding. Buying an options contract does not just change either part of that equation. Short-sellers can hedge with options and lessen/eliminate their losses from their shorts but this does not change short interest at all. The OP has a fundamental misunderstanding of finance. 











**Number 4: ""https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/""**









>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/









Again, an incorrect understanding of short attacks. The SeekingAlpha post linked is a literal conspiracy theory as is the ""CounterfeitingStock"" website. There is a reason why it the ONLY website claiming what it does and does so without any proof. We do not know the author or their background/credentials. The thousands of academics that study markets have never talked about or written a paper about ANYTHING the website or the SeekingAlpha post claim. It was given 0 attention for years until WSB found it and now posts about it every 2 seconds without ever reading the contents of it. It is the equivalent of a 9/11 or JFK conspiracy website.   








Also, the OP claims that malicious naked shorting occurred. There is 0 evidence of this. Nobody that has a background in economics or finance believes this. Just the conspiracy theorists on Reddit. Does it naked shorting occur? I'm sure to some extent it does. Does it occur on a level that has an impact on markets? Nobody has evidence of that and there are a few papers on it. Did it occur here and was it malicious? No reason to believe that it occurred on a large scale or that it was malicious. 












**Number 5: ""How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th, 22nd, or 25th with GME's 69.75 Million Outstanding""**



>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/




Of all the posts I've included this is the only one that has an OP that isn't making blatant mistakes off the bat. Not that there aren't mistakes. But, they're MUCH more forgivable than the others. 








OP's whole argument depends on the FINRA short volume numbers being correct. However, they are not and FINRA even warns for people not to use them to as a proxy for short interest. The numbers include any time a firm decides to sell its own shares so that it can fill a customer's sell order easier. This is relatively common so you can't use these numbers to show actual short positions. This is why the numbers are so off  compared to any third party estimate. I talk more about this problem here : https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/gmfoih1/
























**Number 6: ""GME FLOAT 177%. Apes with the Bloomberg terminal please keep us updated with the numbers.""**












>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leby2i/gme_float_177_apes_with_the_bloomberg_terminal/










So, there's actually not anything directly wrong with the OP since it's just a post of a Bloomberg terminal. The problem is that its obvious that the OP as well as everyone commenting assumes that ""177% of float held"" means the same as ""177% short interest"". This is obviously a very weird mistake to make. It doesn't mean that short interest is 177%. It means that intuitional investors own 177% of float of GameStop. Which is something completely different. Obviously there is a reporting error because institutional investors don't actually own 177% of all outstanding shares. The reasons for this are explained here:

**Number 7: ""S3 Partner's ""S3 SI% of Float"" Metric is Total Bullshit and Here's Why""**





>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbydkz/s3_partners_s3_si_of_float_metric_is_total/








I explain why this post and posts like it about S3's data is completely in this post towards the bottom: https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5b8i/updated_short_interest_numbers_for_gamestop_gme/






Basically WSB confused the short interest calculation with S3's own short interest calculation. They have always done both and have always reported both while labeling them correctly. WSB confused the two and thought that S3 had changed the way they were calculating short interest. This never happened. They have always calculated short interest the same way. 






**Number 8: ""It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers""**




>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le4c62/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/




The original post was removed but I've seen it reposted a bunch. If I find one with the original text I'll link it. Anyway, I talk about the mistakes of this post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldgn9a/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/gm66hgf/




**There are plenty more posts that are completely wrong or misinformed. But, I already spent 1-2 hours typing this out so I'm done for now. I'll get on later to answer any questions if any come up.**





TLDR: Almost every single post that makes claims about the markets, data, or GME do not know what they're talking about. These posts have many mistakes and don't ever have an argument that makes logical sense. Do not believe any post on WSB unless you actually did the work and researched everything an OP claims. Including me.









**EDIT #1 - 2:45 PM: Here are is a bit more info on failure-to-delivers and naked shorting:**








>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmhufze/.











>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling









>A study of fails to deliver, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2014, found no evidence that FTDs ""caused price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis"". Researchers studied 1,492 New York Stock Exchange stocks over a 42-month period from 2005 to 2008, and found that ""greater FTDs lead to higher liquidity and pricing efficiency, and their impact is similar to our estimate of delivered short sales.""








To clarify: Naked shorting occurs and causes failure-to-delivers. However, there are many other causes. A high number of FTD's does not mean any illegal naked shorting occurred. The point I'm trying to make is that there is no reason to believe that something shady has occurred with GME in terms of abusive naked shorting.





The FTD's should be investigated just to make sure. But, I don't think a large amount of FTD's is evidence of abuse.

\---

To recap, the only accounts that have, on average, increased in real terms, as measured by the most common and reliable store of value (gold), are government debt and government deficits. 

The S&P 500 has been flat:

https://preview.redd.it/x55bdmlhlmbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=d14b430484716a868ff61429559b2ecebe2a007c

Middle class wages have steeply declined:

While Government debt and deficits have both increased:

https://preview.redd.it/w4l5j7tjlmbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a85a7aaec64c5061afc9859638ca9caf053b554

If any of this was purely the result of fluctuations in gold prices, we would assume all of these charts would look similar. 

They do not. The government is clearly benefiting from something unique. 

The answer: Inflation. Not consumer prices, but \*real\* inflation. 

Here is real inflation:

https://preview.redd.it/sfcu8dgmlmbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc2eace6e4ffd2c1d68d0c9647f2ea75b01d50ba

Here is government-reported inflation (consumer prices):

https://preview.redd.it/b8hvvejnlmbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a77e0882cc521daaa014e422c7d7020a5970205

And here is real inflation compared to government-reported inflation:

https://preview.redd.it/2ff20tfolmbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=369e27f7d5f1a771202344f1223b198a34f10bd8

Most of the difference between these two values is the productivity gains that the government has stolen from you. 

They do this by conflating CPI with real inflation. 

\----

Inflation is not prices, inflation is the expansion of the money supply. 

Imagine that the aggregate productivity increases of globalization (to use just one example) should have translated into a 10% decrease in consumer prices across the board.

Enter, Keynesian Economics. A decrease in consumer prices is bad! Without much evidence to support it, the assumption is that a reduction in consumer prices will create a negative feedback loop that will cause Recession. 

Enter, The Federal Reserve. Their Keynesian mandate: a 2% year-over-year increase in consumer prices, and they‚Äôll inflate the money supply at what ever level is necessary to achieve this.

The result is that the entire benefit of any productivity increases that should have been realized by the consumer through reduced prices is stolen by The Federal Reserve through monetary inflation.

The primary benefactor of this becomes the government, who will realize a relative reduction in the real value of their massive debt and deficit burdens, allowing them to rapidly expand both - in real terms, not just nominally - as shown in the charts above.

This works, effectively, as an average 100% tax on all productivity gains that society has generated (and will generate) since our abandonment of sound money in the early 1970s. 

\---

You are a squirrel gathering nuts. You are allowed to keep only what you gather, less capital gains tax, of course. The only entity allowed to grow in real terms and in league with the technological advancements of humanity is the government ‚Äì and this will continue until we return to sound money that is backed by something finite. 

This is a lesson that has already been taught by history before. It‚Äôs the entire reason the country was founded on sound money to begin with, and, sadly, it‚Äôs a lesson that‚Äôs going to have to be eventually retaught again.

15qyhx0,2023-08-14 15:52:11,I just went outside and saw a lot of trucks. The economy is BOOMiNG.," 

The US economy is BOOMING. Housing is slowly recovering, rent price are also slowly normalizing. Goods and services are now extremely profitable even when accounting for inflation.

I am a normal person, and let me tell you how I see things from the road.

I went for a short drive and saw 20-30 trucks hauling heavy ass loads. Gas and diesel are way down from their peaks. Everyone was out there enjoying summer, building shit, buying shit, and eating shit.

The soft landing is here.

The Yellow Cab trucking company went under, but they'll be the last. It was due to decades of poor management.

Smaller companies and owner operators have been getting created for almost 2 years now. 

What does that mean for you?

Trucking is the only way everyone in the country can have access to goods AND services that use any kind of tools or materials. If they are making money and have work, it will soon translate into you and the companies you work for, going down the same path--of making a shit ton of money.

l8dn6h,2021-01-30 04:21:48,Suggestion to GME board members as a worst case scenario which will end in a win-win for the company & all share holders while offering shorts an out,"So, there's \~50 million shares available right now and lets say 65 million are shorted.

What if GME offered an obscene amount of shares knowing that they wouldn't all be bought and only bought as a worst case scenario for the hedge funds?

What if they did a cap raise of 50 million shares all at a price of lets say $1000?

If hedge funds are forced to cover, that's their out.  Or for fun, we could do it at 2000.  Or, a range of prices.  The first million shares at 1000, the next at 1100, etc.

All current holders, Ryan Cohen, board members, etc would get diluted.  But, they would be getting diluted and the value of their shares would increase due to the raise being higher than the current stock price.

EXAMPLE. 50m shares at 300 are available right now.  They share 50m more at 1000 each.

Each share gets diluted by half, but each of the current shares gain 500 dollars of value.

Essentially, by selling the shares at 1000 each, current share value goes up to $650.

I don't know what I'm talking about, if what I'm suggesting is stupid, say so.  Or, get this to the top of wsb as a worst case trigger to pull.

The story goes as follows: 

I arrived to America at a young age, an immigrant with less than 100$. The land of dreams, worked my ass off doing multiple jobs, saving every penny I could find, never ate out, never drank much, never partied much.


At age 60 I had amassed enough money to retire, married an amazing woman who had more than enough money. Thinking back my only regret is not enjoying live more, I was always working.


I decided to give my son the opportunity I never had, and so I gave him 145k for him to deposit on save investments and collect dividends to have a little more freedom and enjoy things I never could.


That was about a year ago, but suddenly I started noticing things, he stopped eating with us, always sat as far as he could from me and my wife on family reunions, he stopped talking about this wonderful investments he was so eager to discuss last year (some game store, some FTX coins, some Luna coins, a towel and shampoo company and a movie theater‚Ä¶), I asked him the other day how his investments were doing but he latched out at me saying I wouldn‚Äôt understand and now he won‚Äôt return my calls and avoids me as much as he can.

What do you think happened? Should I ask him if he needs more money?

oiqb08,2021-07-12 12:31:40,Undervalued AF in an Overvalued Market: Morgan Stanley ($MS) Will Explode Soon,"Morgan Stanley is a diamond among rhinestones (no homo).

Now, before you call me a retarded boomer and tell me that this post belongs in r/investing or r/soyboybetacucks, just STFU for a second and keep reading. $MS is up 80% over the past year. Those are not boomer numbers. The market is realizing that $MS is not only a bigass bank but also a slut dragon.

Below are a few reasons why I think this GROWTH STOCK still has tremendous upside ahead:

* PE Ratio of 12 ‚ÅâÔ∏è
* Profit Margin of 25% ‚ÅâÔ∏è
* Operating Margin of 40% ‚ÅâÔ∏è
* $540B of cash on hand ‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è That's bigger than most companies' market caps
* Think of how many bold acquisitions this kind of war chest could fund. Especially with a market crash/recession imminent, Morgan Stanley is poised to go on a buying spree that would put my online shopping addicted mother to shame
* Has recently been making very aggressive investments in fintechs and wealth management platforms (most recently acquired E-Trade and outbid JP Morgan for Eaton Vance). These businesses are poised for growth going forward. Even the shittiest wealth management company out there (Robinhood) is growing more explosively than my Taco Bell diarrhea. And it's not a stretch to assume that more and more users like ourselves will jump from Robinhood to TDA, Merrill, or E-Trade. Everyone offers zero-fee trading now, it's not a moat or anything
* Literally a bulge bracket bank that the government and Fed will never allow to go tits up
* We are in an IPO/SPAC boom, and that just means more investment banking revenues. Also, if markets crash, then well-managed companies will start acquiring other businesses like crazy, and that also means more investment banking revenues. The house always wins
* Recently, certain factions of WSB have been clamoring to buy puts on banks for some reason. Why though? If the Fed makes emergency rate hikes, then banks will moon because higher interest rates are good for them. Or if inflation is only transitory and there are no emergency rate hikes, then banks will moon because lower inflation and an economic recovery are good for them. Inverse WSB

Even if my growth thesis is wrong, I'll still own a healthy, profitable company that has committed to $12B in share buybacks and quarterly dividends of $0.70 per share (3.1% yield at current prices). Come at me bro.

The earnings report is on Thursday. I predict a blowout

TLDR: Small waist, pretty face, with a big bank. If it helps, just think of it as a SPAC with $540B to invest in whatever they want.

As we here all know, once Reddit sets their mind on something *that shit happens.* If the idea catches on, McDonald's is gonna be FUCKED for a while. If the idea catches on and Antiwork gets what they wish for out of this (other companies being forced to follow McDonald's) puts elsewhere might also fuckin PRINT. 

But let's take a look ELSEWHERE for online sentiment on McDonald's. 
**Exhibit B:**
https://subredditstats.com/r/Mcdonalds 
https://subredditstats.com/r/Cooking
As you can see here, the Cooking subreddit gets a little over 46x the amount of posts per day as the McDonald's subreddit. This is extremely bearish as it probably means more people are interested in cooking than they are interested in McDonald's food. I'd also like to add, the vegetarian subreddit gets 5x the amount of posts as the McDonald's sub, and the vegan subreddit gets 23x the amount of posts as McDonald's. 

Speaking of the McDonald's subreddit... 

**Exhibit C**

8e6x9l,2018-04-22 22:58:02,How do I major in stocks?,"So I happen to be pretty good at stocks. One day I decided that I would try the stock market (after watching The Big Short), because I'm smart, and it's a good way at getting money, and I had lost a good amount of money in what turned out to be an MLM company? (my mom told me that it was a pyramid scheme, but they showed me the shape and it was an upside down triangle, not a pyramid, but that's not the point). Someone suggested that I get a Robinhood account, so I downloaded the app and opened an account up! I put in about $10, found a cheap stock, and made almost $3 within a matter of a few days! Can you imagine how much money I would've made if I had put more in? This is WAY better than my Ally Bank Account!

So I decided that I was going to be very risky, so I researched the best stocks of 2018! I deposited almost $300, and found this company called SPY. I looked at the fundamentals, and the company's financial documents seem to look solid! I zoomed out for the 5 year chart, and it only seems to go up! If I had put in money five years ago, I almost would have so much! How's that for a stock choice! I bought in and made so much money percentage-wise!

Now, the stock market is like gambling, and I'm 2 for 2, so I want to take my knowledge to Wall Street, because they (and all of you) seem to need it. However, when I look at my University business majors, all I see are majors like ""Finance"" and ""Accounting"", but no majors in stocks! Is there even a stocks major? Help?

By the way, if any of you need some good stock picks, keep an eye on me, because at this rate, I'll be a millionaire soon!",1,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8e6x9l/how_do_i_major_in_stocks/,wallstreetbets

GME value was hyped into an undisputed bubble, because people wanted to see the narrative come true. I see people with diamond hands calling to hold despite losing over 80%, but let's be honest, holding doesn't make stock prices go up. You need buyers for it to go up. And people are out of money. The smart players bought low and sold high.

You can tell me to fuck off and that you'll laugh at me when GME rebounds, but I feel sorry for the people who bought at $300+ and got hella skunked.",14,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldqp8o/gme_holders_got_skunked/,wallstreetbets
lb3tz7,2021-02-02 19:16:45,WSB POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVISM IN GME?,"As I write this GME is trading at \~$103/sh with a $7.2B market cap.

I'm writing this to talk about GME objectively, not that ""to the moon""  or ""10k isn't a meme"" bullshit or some stupid misplaced crusade against wall street. I'm here to make money.

Right now GME has $586M in CACE ($140M of which is restricted so really $446M to do whatever they want with). Their assets have shrunk most notably from writing down almost $2 BILLION in goodwill over the last couple years. Right now the company has ZERO in goodwill, basically saying it's brand is worthless. I disagree with this after the hype WSB has created for this company. On the liability side, as of Q320, they have $224M and $216M in s-t and l-t debt, respectively, for total debt of $450M.

**GME PLEASE ISSUE STOCK.**

I know it will dilute the shit out of SHs and drop the price but I think it would be a huge buying opportunity. The fact that they haven't already is incomprehensible and arguably negligent. They could've issued 4-5M shares when this thing was over $300 at $200-250/sh and brought in $1B cash. But that's irrelevant now. What they could do is still issue stock, I'm not sure what price they could get for it but I'd be a buyer. Let's say they issue 5M shares at $100/sh, that's $500M cash... $500M would be HUGE in transforming the business. Up that to 10M shares and they bring in $1B. I think $1B is > than $500M. 

They could use $250M to pay down debt and the other half to really catalyze the transformation.

Video gaming is a growth industry and yes, brick and mortar is slowing dying, but as DFV said in his original thesis, that's a long way off.

GME needs to use the hype that WSB CULTIVATED for its brand and capitalize on it. The company couldn't have asked for a better xmas present than what's happening now. People are buying fucking billboards for GME. The company could be to gaming, what Chewy (a >$40B market cap) is to the pet industry. And clearly Ryan Cohen feels this way, too. GME needs to entrench itself into the gamer lifestyle and I really think raising funds now would accelerate this.

**Financials**

Right now I'm estimating GME will make $5B in revenues in 2020, so we're trading at 1.4x depressed revenues. For comparison CHWY trades at \~6x revenue, per yahoo finance. This is a company that made >$8B in 2018 and 2017.

They recently reported holiday sales (Nov and Dec) of $1.7B, down 1.9% yoy with 11% less stores open. SSS comps +4.8% yoy. But here's the most positive, digital sales were +309% yoy, and $1.35B ytd. As digital sales grow, this should help alleviate SG&A expenses which have historically crushed profitability. In 2017, 2018, and 2019 SG&A was $2B, and for 2020 it's looking like it'll be \~$1.4-1.5B.

**Valuation**

This is a very basic back-of-envelope calculation. But if GME can return to \~$8B in revenues (which is entirely possible and reasonable IF they can execute). And maintains historic GM's of \~30%, we get $2.4B in gross profit. And if digital sales continue to make up a larger chunks of revenues and they close redundant stores, they should be able to keep that SG&A expense under $2B. Let's say they can get it to $1.6B, which is about $100-150M above what SG&A will probably be this year (accounting for store reopenings).

So $8B revenues, 30% GM, $2.4B gross profit, $1.6B SG&A = $800M in operating income.

Assuming \~30% tax rate => $560M in net income.

If this plays out, we're currently trading at \~12.9x ($7.2B/$560M) what could be a reasonable net income # in the next couple years. My point is that GME might not be as overvalued as people think.",0,0.47,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb3tz7/wsb_potential_for_activism_in_gme/,wallstreetbets

vdbhyt,2022-06-16 02:38:45,The Next Short Squeeze: $HOOD,"Alright, it's been a while since I posted here but I know how much some of you guys like short squeezes.

This isn't a P&L play, Robinhood's revenue growth has stopped as the retail trading bubble pops. I can't see it getting much better in the short term. Combine that with the PFOF (Payment For Order Flow) ban, and you might be asking why anyone would buy this stock.

Robinhood doesn't have any debt. Check the [balance sheet](https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2022/q1/Robinhood-Exhibit-99.1_3.31.22_FINAL.pdf), it's pristine. They have a book value (total assets - total liabilities) around $8.22 per share according to [finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&ty=c&ta=1&p=m), I checked it and got $8.40 but I might've gotten the number of shares incorrect. It's currently trading around $7.20 a share after hours, meaning that if the company gets liquidated, that's the value returned to shareholders. 

Not only that, but Robinhood has $6.19B in cash on hand as of their last earnings report, but is trading at a market cap of $6.15B. I bought some shares today, meaning I am straight up buying cash for less than it's worth. If someone told you that you could buy a $20 bill for $19.95, you'd take that deal as many times as you could get it.

Market fear over banning of PFOF, retail trading dying out, and a general market hatred for the boy from Bulgaria who runs it have created this insane opportunity for a short squeeze.

According to [fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/hood), HOOD currently has a short interest of 11.28%. FTX [recently](https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-exchange-ftx-ceo-reveals-stake-trading-app-robinhood-2022-05-12/) bought up 7.6% of their float. This means there are less shares being traded, a low float is key for a squeeze.

My thesis is that it will just take one piece of positive news regarding a potential buyout or hedge fund purchase, which is very likely at these levels, to cause a big short covering rally in the stock. I'd target the $12-15 range. The best news is that you know Vlad won't turn off the buy button for this one.",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vdbhyt/the_next_short_squeeze_hood/,wallstreetbets
twcc5b,2022-04-04 20:36:15,Is AMC primed to rip soon?,"&#x200B;

Cost to borrow has been relatively flat for AMC since the June run up. Through volatility and scarcity in shares it was low. It looks like it is reverse coursing upward now according to Ortex data. This is good news for bulls and bad for bears.

https://preview.redd.it/mh97bvi5nkr81.png?width=1369&format=png&auto=webp&s=33f9cbd46204cea6c990a99ae42f9df4f2c8ac50

Utilization \[% of total shares that are lendable that are actually borrowed\] has been sitting at 100% for some time now, last time it did this was prior to its run in June. The times it came down from 100% utilization were when it bounced up a bit on the first initial volume spike then the price came down a bit and then Utilization popped back to 100% and it then ran to $70. I have a feeling we see a dip in Utilization due to the recent run to $34 and a spike back up to 100% after it got shot back down in the next update.

https://preview.redd.it/rb0b35d4nkr81.png?width=1269&format=png&auto=webp&s=af194a7bbc89c473170b1657e23fdd041293d4c5

Volume has done rips and then dips then finally a rip on both the January and June run up. This seems to be a similar trend on AMC right now. Maybe it leads to something? Will there be a second volume bounce now that it cooled off for a few days? I believe it will but who really knows?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vs1zmngankr81.png?width=1361&format=png&auto=webp&s=41bfe6aa59ce4e2c8f350237e4677e918d0cbc9a

Shares on loan average were 60 days prior to June run up. Who the fuck holds a short position over 30 days unless they are dumbasses? Well now its fuckin 80 days man. Holy shit what is wrong with them... they could have covered at $12.90 and then renewed a short position now at a much higher level. The average short fuckin held through that. They either CANT cover because it is too much or they truly think it will come down back to $12 and below.

https://preview.redd.it/7fpgxo3cnkr81.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=8767ec5e21ba2a3a1e7ab4d9081e2c7b4fd03f5a

Days to cover in all 4 \[2 week/3 month on loan/estimated SI\] have all shown a up move, then a drop, then a short cool off before having second drop in the June run up. Currently DTC on all 4 have dropped, now its is cooling off.. will we see a second drop in DTC indicators?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ups6dukdnkr81.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e8f018ce0e3b275b3f47f760785fb3531226cc8

Then finally, higher short interest then the June run up. Shares on loan are less \[even with 100% utilization\], to me this just means the short sellers have less shares to try and push this shit back down after it does rip. Maybe I am wrong. Correct me if so.

I can talk about fundamentals improvements \[long line up of movies, sitting on a shit ton of cash, gold mine investment actually worked out for them, debt pushed to 2029 from 2026 with some high interest debt paid, they are going to make a popcorn product to buy at grocery stores and they are also coming out with a credit card\]. With all the fundamental improvements alone, I dont see this shit being less then $30 just because it held so high and for such a long time last year. $30+ in my opinion.

o9bsl2,2021-06-28 03:14:14,Ford 2023 Long Calls,"I know it's not a lot, but I'm putting in around $213 for three 2023 Ford Calls with a strike price of $30. Ford is a good brand. Ford is quintessentially American and a keystone of innovation. Here is why I like ford. Tesla is expensive. German electric (VW, Audi, Mercedes, Porsche) is pretty pricey, not to mention that VW uses a different charging adapter than Tesla, which creates even more confusion for the average consumer (""Why can't I charge at this Walmart?""). Ford has been undervalued ever since they decided not to take the 2008 bail-out money. That's okay since that ship has sailed and they are out from this for the most part.

Americans for the most part don't like change. Electric cars bring change. Between having to charge at home or at work, finding a new mechanic, or even learning all the new ins and outs of an electric car, this change and influx of new information is scary for the average American consumer. No matter the brand of car, new electric cars will bring this plight. Keeping with what they know (which is American-made-American brands), these consumers would opt for Ford in a heartbeat (if ford is all they have ever owned). There is brand loyalty in the car sector. Once someone finds something they like, they tend to stick with that car or brand for as long as they can, or until they feel they need a switch. 

1. Ford has brand loyalty from its current base, which can make the shift to electric more comfortable.
2. Old people aren't buying electric cars (new cars, even) en masse. The CPI-E shows a rise in their cost of living. This will affect everyone, but for someone with higher living and healthcare costs (old people), buying a car might not be a top priority (plus if you're not able to drive in a few, the opportunity of the car purchase might be too great compared to saving money for healthcare or fun things).  
3. Electric competition is not great. Cadillac is barely in the door, Toyota Electric is viewed as a luxury level, not an alternative choice for the avg consumer, Honda has a few electric cars (but they're seriously no fun--cmon, cars should be fun. Ford has fun, Ford has innovation. Ford has price, Ford has variety. 
4. Compared to other car companies, ford stock is dumb cheap. 
5. Ford's lineup is their greatest strength. A car for everyone. Electric or not. In every price range. In every industry. Electric cars being fully mainstream should be about 10 years out. We're lagging in chargers, acceptance, and price. Ford hybrid vehicles fill this void, all while not separating electric or nonelectric into higher classes of luxury features (Toyota). Electric here is not a status symbol, it is a mainstream dream, and Ford wants it to become reality.

Cyberpunk isn't our reality. Tunnels going between cities isn't coming anytime soon. The cybertruck is a luxury vehicle with a boastful design that screams (look at me, I've got money, and even if this car can tug a boat, I don't care, I'm definitely a suburbanite with a brand new toy.) Tesla's are cool. Tesla's are fun. But they catch eyes, and they make electric cars a status symbol, rather than an environmental obligation. Ford combats that, directly, fairly, and even if some of their prices (Mach-E with a starting price fo 41k-ish) is a bit high, the Mach-E is just a fun version of a mustang and is meant to catch eyes, unlike the Lightning or the Fusion.

Ford's lineup: [https://www.ford.com/](https://www.ford.com/)

Inflation is looming: Sure, probably, it might already be here. I don't care. Economies go in cycles, boo hoo. People will always need cars. Might not be able to purchase a car, but who cars, you can lease. Ford has their own leasing LLC under their ticker, and more importantly, FORD HAS AFFORDABLE VEHICLES THAT SUIT A WIDE RANGE OF NEEDS THAT DONT COMPROMISE TOO MUCH QUALITY FOR THEIR PRICE OR CHANGE IN SIZE. 

Ford is a value investment. What are your thoughts?",10,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9bsl2/ford_2023_long_calls/,wallstreetbets
1bqnxcc,2024-03-29 12:21:26,$DJT: The Play Has Only Just Begun,"ATTENTION ALL REGARDS:

This DD is a continuation of the DJT play that was initially proposed in this post: [(link to post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bikpfj/these_calls_could_be_500_baggers_turn_1000_into/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). (For the record, this is not a post just to pump my bags. I realized \~$7,500 on last week's move and have initiated new positions. I legitimately think this thing has a lot more room to run, particularly because that's the exact opposite of what everyone is expecting).

The thesis was sound:

1. A low float stock that can move significantly if volume comes in
2. A merger and a ticker change to generate media coverage and bring the volume in
3. A cult-like following with a track record of pouring their money into Donnie T related opportunities

The issue with this was the fixation on the 500 bagger. While DJT certainly could have tested it's ATH at $190 before 3/28, that was obviously not a likely outcome, especially when everyone was betting on it.

While, unfortunately the 500 bagger didn't play out, there is still good news. The move that we did get has now primed this stock for a perfect setup, potentially plowing through $80 and toward the $190 ATH. Longs are moping around with their worthless calls talking about how it was a ""good ride"" and shorts are already bragging about the easy tendies they are going to make from fading this POS company into oblivion.

The consensus is now that the play is dead in the water which is why this is the perfect opportunity to take the opposite side.

HEAR ME OUT:

1. Be patient with the MAGA crowd. The snail mail that boomers have been writing to their financial advisors instructing them to smash the fucking bid on DJT isn't going to arrive until next week. The blue-collar crew have been wanting to pile in but are still waiting on their bi-weekly pay check to hit. Give them time. They are a little slower moving than us degen gamblers, but rest assured, they are still making their way to the party.
2. This stock is majorly short-biased now. Borrow rate now at 600%: [(link to post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqk2av/djt_short_borrow_rate_at_600/). Everyone is just assuming that this is a layup short and that Trump will dump his stock soon which is unlikely in my view. If this thing does not immediately plummet next week, bears are going to be shitting the bed.
3. In addition to the looming MAGA volume and the potential for upside down shorts, there will be massive FOMO from retail if we start to get a move to the upside. Traders that lost money on the initial run up or missed it entirely will stumbling over each other to get back in.
4. The stock is up like 100% in a week and has essentially just spent the last few days consolidating sideways ABOVE the local high of $58.72 from the previous spike in January. From a purely technical perspective, this doesn't really look like a one and done rally that is just going to dump infinitely from here. Dare I say the chart might even look a bit bullish?
5. FED was dovish last meeting. GDP print was strong yesterday. Rates have been gently coming down this week. Inflation ticking up a bit recently but not enough for anyone to actually take it seriously yet. Not that this is a macro-play at all, but I do think positive sentiment around the macro environment is a prerequisite for a move like this to take place.
6. **Easter Fucking Weekend.** What better way to spread the DJT word than some familial chit chat over a lovely Easter Sunday meal. Devouring turkey and deviled eggs, celebrating the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, and a wee bit of hot stock gossip. I can already hear my Granny now, ""Should I buy me some of that Donald Trump stock?"" Yes, Granny. Yes, you should.

MY POSITIONS (will likely be adding Monday morning if all goes accordingly):

https://preview.redd.it/h3bqrpkag9rc1.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=d70f60e6c8a00310108c16712dbb10200557c38e

DISCLAIMER: Not investment advice. Do your own DD. No offense intended to any of the parties referenced in this post. I have much love and respect for everyone. Especially my Granny.

UPDATE 03/29/24: All-In Podcast discusses DJT at length [(link to clip)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1001s). Chamath compares DJT to ""Bowie Bonds"" where people will be using it as a vehicle to invest in Trump's brand which will have a significantly different value placed on it than the revenues of a shitty social media company. David believes that many Trump supporters will buy the stock as a ""protest vote"". Lot of eyes on this podcast and they discuss the topic in a very serious manner. Honestly, think this is more than enough to fuel a gap up on Monday morning. Good luck to all.

UPDATE 03/30/24: I am also long \~500k of the DJT crypto token [(link to token)](https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0x32a6047bded36b985534750a4292a35d5dbd4e5f?utm_source=coingecko&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=searchresults) which has seen a fair amount of buying throughout the weekend. Makes me hopeful that more and more attention is being allocated toward the ""Long Trump"" play. Excited for trading on the DJT stock to get going again. If we are gapping up on Monday morning, I will probably look to buy more calls for 4/5. If we are gapping down, will see how it holds up in the morning and assess from there. Good luck everyone.

UPDATE 03/31/24: Happy Easter to everyone who celebrates it. My granny did not mention the DJT stock nor did any of my relatives. We are currently gapping down on RH, but not necessarily to levels that I would consider the play to be over. Not gonna lie... it's not looking great for my thesis, but I think we still have a chance. See you guys bright and early tomorrow. Good luck folks.

UPDATE 04/01/24: This is not an April Fools joke. It appears that I was utterly wrong on this DD. We are currently down \~25% on the day which is essentially the exact opposite of what I was anticipating. GG to the bears. I hope you are taking profits though because this still seems an incredible risky stock to be short. I threw some chump change at a few calls on the morning dip. Just going to ride them all out to expiry since they are essentially worthless already anyway. Probably not gonna post anymore updates unless this starts ripping people's faces off. Fingers crossed.

ljtshl,2021-02-14 18:14:16,$BNTX massively undervalued - the COVID guys,"Hi fellow retards,

long term $BB and $AMD investor here. Wanted to point your short attention span to a massively undervalued, hidden champion from the COVID vaccine and cancer treatment world:

**$BNTX** 

**Some facts**

* They own one of two **actually working COVID vaccines** (mRNA). *COVID is this thing that keeps you at home, in case you didn't realize.*
* They have a **50/50 commercial agreement with Pfizer** (sharing cost and revenue)
* US paid **$19.90** per dose - poorer countries pay probably less, richer more- **assuming an average revenue of $10** per dose here
* Their 2021 production capacity just increased to max. **2bn doses/year** 
* Based on this, I'm estimating a **$20bn** (that's 10 zeros) FY2021 revenue**, Pfizer and BioNTech combined on the vaccine only**, up from a few hundred k in 2020. 
* Expected net **profit $10bn** for BioNTech 
* BNTX's market cap just $21bn - that could make a **four or five bagger** from here
* Vaccine **can be easily adjusted** to target new mutants - and won't need lengthy re-approvals (see Reuters news today). 
* Your wife's boyfriend will probably need **two fresh shots every year** to stay safe  
* **Biontech CEO Ugur is on a mission - cycling to the lab (**Papa factor)
* COVID is just a side-business - they have a healthy cancer treatment pipeline
* **Q4 2020 earnings call expected for March**

Plot twist. Twitter is now going to have to focus on lawsuits from advertisers who have been massively overpaying to advertise to bots and shills.

Twitter has literally been ripping off advertisers. Oh, you want your ad to reach 100,000,000 viewers? Done. Oh sorry we had our heads in the sand let‚Äôs just ignore the fact your ad only reached 50,000,000 viewers because half of them are either bots or bad actor accounts being paid to post by shady entities.

The door is open for lawsuits galore.

I‚Äôm impartial to Elon. I know with you guys some love him, some hate him, and there is no in between.

But I do think it made sense for him to back out of the deal. He would have basically been buying a used car dealership and having to waste more money than he would have spent buying the dealership fixing all the cars that looked good on paper but were flaming death traps waiting to happen in reality.

I think this was a smart move on his part. Twitter did everything they could to try to hide the actual extent of their own corruption and did not pass the engine check.

Fair game in my opinion and if I wasn‚Äôt worried about lost opportunity cost in other areas I‚Äôd really be considering puts on Twitter.

1. Xi passes laws supporting private enterprise to regain trust of investors

2. Still strong GDP growth at 5%/year even while facing so many headwinds

lkq6wm,2021-02-15 23:29:48,"SILVER, the investment that has no risk and infinite possibilities! DD on $PSLV and more!üöÄ","Ok no risk might be clickbait, no investment is fully risk-free but I still stand buy my point: buy silver, let me explain:

Silver massively undervalued and like GME it's possible to fuck with Wall street if it squeezes. A silver squeeze you ask? Isn't the silver market too big to squeeze? Silver ETF SLV (which is a scam) admits it's possible and that they're vulnerable to one. [http://gata.org/node/20913](http://gata.org/node/20913)

How is a squeeze possible then? Let me quote a Bloomberg article of 2014 to explain:  ""About $5 trillion of silver and $18 trillion of gold circulated globally last year, according to CPM Group"". $5 trillion dollar you say... After a quick search on the internet you will find that both total supply and total demand for silver hovers around 1 billion ounces a year. [https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/](https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/) This would mean that in 2014 (when the price was around $20 per ounce) the true circulating supply was $20 billion, a difference of 250 times! This difference is what we call 'paper silver' and just like paper hands it sucks, driving down the price. 

If the price of silver increases massively, those who create paper silver will lose a lot of money, and if it keeps rising it's just a matter of time before futures and fake ETF's will stop providing it. If that happens the price of silver will inevitably rise way further as supply will decrease up to 250x!

BTW: In the near past JPM was punished for manipulating the silver market as well, just a sign that stuff like this happens to a market this big.

ATTENTION  **üåàüêª** :

Are your expectations on the market negative? Do you think stock prices will fall? Do you believe we are in a bubble? I found the perfect investment: Silver! After the great recession and the short crash last year silver crashed quickly before it rose to the occasion. In 2008 it crashed a bit, only to rise almost 5x afterwards. In 2020 it dropped to appox $12 an ounce and rose to nearly $30. If you think the stock market will crash, this is a great opportunity.

Ok, now that the **üåàüêª** are interested, we can continue.

Time lag is a phenomenon in economics where there is a delay between an action and a consequence. Right now we are in the middle of this. As silver is sold in many forms (Physical, ETF, Trust, Futures) it's prone to price lag. Look at your local Bullion dealer. Are there many coins/bars in stock? Probably not, and the price has hardly increased last month. By buying trusts that actually own silver like $PSLV and $PHAG you can profit off this phenomenon.

READ IF YOU'RE A BOOMER:

Silver is actually a great long-term investment. It is important for many technologies we will see a lot of in the future. Think about batteries, solar panels and medicine. With the market for all of these 3 increasing quickly. This could be sped up by the US government if the current administration starts funding projects for renewable energy and electric cars. Also, in 10 years we will see a peak in Silver mining, but after that there will most likely be a decline in supply until the mines are almost completely empty. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344913002747#sec0080](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344913002747#sec0080) 

Important sidenote: If you want to profit of a possible squeeze you can also look into buying stock of silver miners. These will obviously rise a lot if the price of silver goes to what it should be worth. 

Conclusion: There are many possible scenarios imaginable in which silver prices will rise a lot, both in the short and long term. Buying silver futures does nothing, nor will buying $SLV. Buy physical silver or silver trusts which market values are the same as the amount of silver in their vault! 

TL;DR: 

Is this really needed? Buy silver!!  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ (NOT SLV)

Sure maybe a couple of apes who bought straight OTM with 0DTE make a few but the real people making money are the people who are running the show. In fact, this whole page which is dedicated to sticking it to the man only allows you to post large cap stocks thus increasing the value for those who already are millionaires while the average retail investor just loses their life savings. This page has turned into the opposite of what it is. Soon the American people will realize that and soon SPY will crash as once the middle class recovers this will go down. It‚Äôs not the rich that control the people. The people control the rich. We‚Äôre their number one source of income. So one day, maybe not today, or the next, but one day, mark my works, the middle class will rise again.

100k by age 25 would be relatively easy if you had a job when you were 17 that paid at least 30k a year, and stayed at home another 3 years before getting roomies. In fact, you'd have made 220k in that time period.

The alternative is to obviously yolo. Yes this includes big earners. Let me explain.

While the average life expectancy is 72.8. Most people are seriously worn out by then in some way or another. Odds are your fucking days are over by then and you look like a prune.

Ideally you'd shoot for retirement (realistically) by age 45 max. That gives you another 10 years of your mature, but not elderly, life. Seriously, the best case scenario is you move to an elderly ""party village"" in FL we're you'll prolly catch and STD and die within the decade anyways.

Take it from me, living a conservative lifestyle is a miserable existence. God forbid you're single too. It's tolerable until you hit 30 and by then you're just fed up with being sub-par.

rqtos2,2021-12-29 00:04:28,MRNA is a $30 stock,"I don't do DD.  I look at things from a 10000 foot view.  From my elevation Moderna looks way overvalued.  In December of 2018 Moderna's IPO was the largest biotech IPO in history valuing the company at an incredible $7.5B.  At the time they were touting their research into mRNA as ""the software of life"".  The news story that I read said that there was "" no mRNA-based drug has ever been approved by the FDA nor any other regulatory agency, so it will be years before Moderna will be able to bring anything to market"".  Well that changed pretty quickly and the market went crazy.  Taking the crazy valution from $7.5B to $200B before backing off to the current $100B.  Does the fact that they came up with a fairly effective vaccine (and we don't want to get into the whole debate here about how effective it was) mean that they should now be valued at 12 x what they were worth when they IPO'd?  I say no.  The next drug that they come up with is going to have to go through regular clinical trials and won't have the advantage  of being needed by every human being on the planet.  So what is it worth?  I gave my prediction away in the headline.  For  the first 18 or so months of its existence it was a $20 stock.  Their tech is now a bit more proven so in my mind I'll give them a 50% bump.  That makes it a $30 stock.  I also think that it's going to go down faster than most people think.  Here in Canada, where we have a much higher vaccine acceptance rate, there is resistance to the booster.  Tens of thousands of available appointments are going unfilled in the midst of the Omicron wave.  Covid is largely being ignored.  The government is advising against travel yet everyone I know is travelling for the holidays.  No one that I know cancelled a trip because of Omicron.  If the plane was leaving, they were going to be on it.  When you hear that someone has Covid now you kind of feel badly for them because they have to isolate for a few days.  You're not worried that they are going to die.  Is this a population that is going to rush out and get the booster.  no way.  There's talk of changing the definition of ""fully vaccinated"" to include a booster but I can't see the political will to do that when the population is effectively ""voting"" by abstaining.  Politician's first job is to get elected and second job is to get re-elected.  They know that.  When there is a 70% uptake in vaccines they can  come up with mandates.  When there is a 40% (I made that number up) uptake in boosters, they won't be quite so quick to mandate them.

I picked Moderna and bought long $70 puts.  I think that Novavax would be just as good a target.

Listen guys, this a sure MOON. Star Wars is extremely popular but Marvel is on a league on its own. 

On the link attached above is the Top Grossing Films of all time. Disney is the big boss of media. Kids can watch the same movies all over again. 

Another thing: Disney‚Äôs toy and licensing business is a multibillion dollar banger. I dont think people are pricing this in for earnings. Christmas sales must have been through the roof. 

Disney partnership with Ubisoft to make Star Wars games; fans were extremely disappointed with EA and their shitty battlefronts. This means Disney wants to expands their presence even more on the Video Game Industry. Just wait till they start making more game for their multiple franchises. Fucking Mickey Mouse, Toy Story, Marvel and every other game they can make.

If you are have been locked in a basement for a while you may have missed that real-estate market has been hot. Low rates has made bored desperate housewifes think of buying a new house with a pool or second home where to go on a romantic weekend with their boyfriend. Try and buy a condo in a popular vacation spot like Miami. Condos are gone within a week of listing, sometimes within a day.

Mortgage rate is 3%, which makes owning a real-estate a great hedge against inflation. If inflation kicks in then the $300k condo today will be $400k in few years. And your house payment will be much lower in today‚Äôs money versus in 5 years.

**Mortgage numbers in 2020 gave been best ever**

December mortgage numbers 26% higher than year ago (Refi up 102% from last year)

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/mortgage-demand-from-homebuyers-spikes-28percent.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/mortgage-demand-from-homebuyers-spikes-28percent.html)

January mortgage numbers 16% higher than year ago

For the year, Loan Origination on volume grew 71% annually, but the data is even better, because if you consider the refi‚Äôs which do not add to the volume, **there was a 158% growth in refinancing YOY.**

[https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loan-officers-made-insane-money-in-q4-2020/](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loan-officers-made-insane-money-in-q4-2020/)

If rates start to increase we may see even more refi efforts in 2021 to capture the low interest rates.

**Alright, so why Rocket Mortgage?**

Well it is often in the **top 3 best rated mortgage companies**. In addition, the company‚Äôs its primary focus is mortgages unlike Chase of BoA. So if mortgage numbers are good, then their numbers will be really good because their revenues is heavily depended on mortgages.

Brand recognition - It‚Äôs probably one of the most recognizable names for mortgages. Their website gets over 110 million visits per year. More than any other mortgage site.

They are innovative, they have developed a directory for all of the local mortgage brokers. Now this is interesting. They are listing the brokers and do not charge any fees for the leads to the brokers whether they work with Rocket Mortgage or not for the load. That‚Äôs lost revenue right? Well, I think that they are building a good relationship with the local brokers, so that the brokers can get the origination fee and then send them business back to get the loan via Rocket Mortgage.

**Share ownership**

They IPOd around $21.50, then went as high as $30m, and then dropped to $20 levels. **Short interest in Rocket Mortgage is 30%. But the leadership team owns 95% of the entire Rocket Companies** parent company. So this shows huge insider holding of this company, which clearly indicates their strong belief in this company. Check out their CEO‚Äôs message to the shorts [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/29/rocket-companies-ceo-on-the-stocks-friday-surge.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/29/rocket-companies-ceo-on-the-stocks-friday-surge.html)

**Buzz**

There will be a buzz for rocket mortgage. They will have two superbowl ads this year to stay current and in people‚Äôs minds. This should play well with the time leading up to their earnings call which is coming up later in February. This can be a catalyst for the stock (it jumped last week to 23.50 with the whole shorts frenzy)

I have a good conviction on this company, but I am open to hear opposite views from you degenerates.

o6t0yw,2021-06-24 03:54:50,Why $WISH for something you already have? $BABA DD,"Tl;Dr: BABA is the preferred alternative to WISH from a value/fundamentals perspective.

$WISH and $BABA both excel in selling chinese shit to american consumers. $WISH‚Äôs growth rate looks incredibly tempting. They grew revenue by 35% last year. 

However, $WISH lost $745 million last year. Ouch. Worst of all, nearly $400M of that is stock-based compensation to pad the pockets of management, as well as $265m in G&amp;A expenses for their new lofty salaries, a 300% increase in spending from 2019.

So $WISH is burning YOUR cash and diluting shares to grow its revenue. They‚Äôre paying management massive salaries, giving them stock compensation while stockholders suffer losses.

Wouldn‚Äôt you rather get the same exposure and performance from a company making money?

Let‚Äôs take a look at $BABA.

TTM Revenue $110B

TTM FCF $34.5B

TTM FCF growth 20%

TTM Revenue growth 40% vs. $WISH 35%

5 year average Revenue growth 45%

3 year average FCF growth 30%, $AAPL 20%, S&amp;P 25%

Price/TTM FCF 16.5x, $AAPL 23.7x, S&amp;P 25.5x, $WISH has no FCF.

Price/TTM FCF/3yr growth .5-.85, $AAPL 1.2, S&amp;P 1

Market cap $572B

Book value $150B

Bear Case: Assuming company maintains current FCF and dies in 20 years, generates $680B cash for shareholders. $680B + $150B book value = undervalued by $250B

Bull case: Company maintains 20% FCF growth for 10 years, $213B in FCF by 2031, generates $3000B over 20 years for shareholders = undervalued by $2500B

5-year DCF model using 5 yr averages with a 8% discount rate and 2% perpetual growth/10yr yield puts this stock at $350.

Oh, and all these valuations assume no Ant group IPO, which alibaba could own a $50B stake in. Not to mention the massive moat and diversity in revenue stream for $BABA.

No need to $WISH for gains or growth. They‚Äôre already here in $BABA.",10,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o6t0yw/why_wish_for_something_you_already_have_baba_dd/,wallstreetbets
1duqpbi,2024-07-03 22:07:49,$DIS Disney is at a once in a decade buying opportunity,"This is the weekly chart for $DIS. Each candle represents one week of trading and the chart goes back to 2010.

https://preview.redd.it/1wqkuxf0ldad1.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&s=33e19b58c9f5fa193d355ad551aca96a5061c85c

$DIS has been in a clear uptrend for more than a decade, until the 2022 bear market showed up, inflation and the mini recession wrecked the stock market and $DIS in particular. 

The dark green line is the 80-week moving average. Which represents the average weekly closing price of the last 80 weeks.   
Whenever this moving average is trending up, the equity in question is in an uptrend and vice versa.

Notice how the moving average trended down for nearly two years between 2022 and 2024.

Since the beginning of the year it flattened and has actually been slowly curling up.

Once price breaks above this moving average and comes back to it, it's called a breakout and backtest setup.

This is an incredibly bullish setup with high odds of success. It gives buyers one final chance of entering after the first major breakout.

Now I want you to take a closer look at the volume. Notice how weekly volume has actually been declining as the price has been dropping throughout the last 3 months. This is exactly what you want to see. You want to see sellers less and less interested as the price drops and then you want to see volume expand once buyers are back in and price is trending higher.

ENTRY :  
Now, let's talk about timing the entry. Let's take a look at the zoomed-in portion in pink.  
You will notice that $DIS has a tendency to form a bull flag / bull penant / wedge structure and as soon as price breaks above the resistance level of this structure the stock rallies for several weeks.

Right now we are in the middle of a 3rd one of these structures that hasn't broken out yet. The objective entry would be on the first breakout of this structure if you're looking to trade this aggressively.

Personally. I'm quite happy with the 80-week backtest and I don't want to wait for the breakout so I can buy it here while it's cheap..

TARGET :  
If the stock simply retraces back to the middle of its long-term uptrending channel. That would translate to a rally upwards of $160 by the end of next year.

The December 2025 $120 leap call options are trading at $7.3. That means if the $160 target is realized by the end of 2025, those options will net $40 in profit. a 550% gain in 18 months.  
If the price target is realized earlier, those options will net even higher profit. And if $DIS exceeds this price target, again those gains would be much higher.  
I like the Dec 2025 $120 calls because the far out expiration drastically reduces this risk of theta decay, and gives this setup plenty of time to realize the price target.

Keep in mind that the full-measured move from this consolidation pattern actually puts $DIS at $150 by the end of this year. Which can return an excess of 2000% given how cheap the call options currently are. Just beware of the risk if you're trading this year's Dec expirations.

Good luck regards.

15n09cn,2023-08-10 03:03:57,How is UPS not crashing right now?,"Let me get these numbers right, 

UPS is investing $30b into employee salary and benefits over 5 years. 

UPS has $9b cash on hand. 

Scratching my head on this one. How is UPS affording these raises? They are going to have to take on extra debt or sell shares. They make $10b/year profit. They are going to have to spend $6b/year just for the employees. **They just cut their profit by 60%**. Am I missing something? And these costs will go up after 5 years, you'll have a much higher percentage of employees sitting at 5+ years and higher percentage of full time employees (that's what happens when you offer $170k for a job that requires no education). 

Seems to me like UPS deserves a 50% correction. Am I wrong?

EDIT: to all you dumb regards saying ""HAHA YOU BOUGHT PUTS AMIRITE????"" stfu. I literally don't have **any** positions in the market, and I am broke AF and won't be investing any time in the near future. You know when can have a negative outlook on a company without buying risky investments at the same time right?

> Seems to me like UPS deserves a 50% correction. Am I wrong?

This is an open ended question and the post is tagged as 'discussion'. Some of you need to grow the fuck up and learn to read.

And stop treating this like some DD. It's not. I saw a few numbers, had a few thoughts, and threw them down, and asked a question. This post reflects my initial thoughts on the matter. That's it. $30b over 5 years seemed like a fuck ton, but as pointed out to me, UPS already spends $44b/year on employees, so if that's the case then $30b over 5 years isn't that much. Done. My question answered. I asked, ""Am I wrong?"" answer is yes because I was missing some context. HOLY SHIT I WAS WRONG? idgaf. This was a question I posted out of curiosity. I'm not even in the fucking market.

EDIT 2: as some have pointed out, $170k is including benefits, and at 60 hours/week. Totally different than what I assumed, which is what my entire question was based on.

**LAST EDIT** No need to comment on this anymore you regards. $170k figure was wrong. It's $120k + benefits, and that's at 60 hours a week. Totally different story. I think that's reasonable and maybe only 5-10% higher than I would have thought. UPS will be fine.

l57i0n,2021-01-26 05:51:36,The Bullish Thesis for NEE üîãüöÄ,"# NextEra Energy is the play that you need to make if you believe in Biden's infrastructure reforms.

(before reading, note that they are reporting earnings on the morning of the 26th, I will be taking advantage of the IV crush to open a LEAP position)

To start, I see an awful amount of praise for ETF's when playing this sector. However, while ETF's offer greater security in individual investments, the true risk and reward of playing this sector becomes apparent through the lens of comparison. The three ETF's I concentrated on for this DD are:

* **ICLN**
* **TAN**
* **FAN**

While these are all popular, none of them have weighted NEE anywhere near its capitalization potential. Just the next two years alone will nearly certainly double the stock's market cap. They have over $50B in infrastructure investments planned through 2022, and you can be assured that they will have an advantage to this [in the form of tax credits and subsidies.](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/nee-stock-is-ready-to-soar-under-green-biden-administration/)

That's right, Uncle Sam is going to skullfuck this company with tax credits and subsidies to the point that this thing could have a TSLA-esque potential. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, how does this company look when lined up among some competition?

The particular interest with NEE is that they seemingly do it all. This shit is like the Chic-Fil-A of the energy sector. It could honestly not give less of a shit about saving the world, its only focus is cash flow, which in terms that WSB is accustomed to, is just fuel reserves for its inevitable moon mission. I analyzed 3 different companies in the renewable energy sector, and those were

1. Plug Power
   1. slowing of net income in Q/Q growth.
2. Enphase
   1. already boomed. the party for this one got busted pretty fast. imo just a shitty boomer pick
3. First Solar
   1. This one is a legitimate competitor in my view. 
   2. I would honestly invest in this if its revenue sources were more diverse.

So taking these into account, NEE seems as if its obligatory duty is to take the throne of the renewable market (if you're for some reason doubting it even slightly)

# TLDR: EZ CASHFLOW, ECO-CONSCIOUS, and *bigly* expansion with tax credits incoming to help assist.

But I'm not even gonna elaborate, 'cause you'd think I'm smoking the same stuff as Hunter Biden in Forbidden City.

The Beijing Auto Show starts on 4/25, so we're expecting **GIGANTIC** announcements for points 4 and 5 before and during the car show. The stock has been tanking harder than your portfolio during a crypto winter, but that's about to change, you paper-handed cucks.

**XPEV literally can't go tits up,** 'cause VW is gonna come to the rescue if shit hits the fan. I wouldn't be surprised if the Germans swallow XPEV whole with a tender offering in the near future, 'cause they're so desperate for that sweet, sweet EV tech.

w5w8ix,2022-07-23 05:45:48,"After these earnings, $TWTR is insolvent pro forma for the $13 billion merger debt, which would blow up financing and end the deal","\*Not legal or investment advice

Terrible earnings from $TWTR today.

If $TWTR did not have the bid outstanding, it would be trading at $10-$15/share instead of $40/share. Look at $SNAP.

At $10-$15/share, Twitter's equity value is $8-$12 billion but it is trying to take on $13 billion of acquisition financing. Twitter also has negative FCF so difficult to service additional debt.

Why this is important: the $13 billion committed bank financing to acquire Twitter has a Solvency Certificate (pasted below). A ""senior authorized financial officer"" must sign the certificate saying that Twitter is solvent *after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions* (ie after taking on $13 billion of additional debt).

Under conventional definitions of solvency, Twitter would be insolvent with $13 billion of additional debt - zero to negative pro forma equity value, no free cash flow to service the debt.

What this means for the deal: 

The merger agreement includes a term that:  ""Parent \[essentially Musk\] fails to consummate the Merger as required pursuant to the Merger Agreement, including because the equity, **debt and/or margin loan financing is not funded, Parent will be required to pay Twitter a termination fee of $1.0 billion.**""

**If Twitter is unable to certify that it is solvent pro forma for $13 billion of additional debt, the financing does not close, which means the merger does not close which means Twitter only gets the $1 billion termination fee and not specific performance at $54.20/share. Which would result in Twitter trading at $11-$16/share (undisturbed price of $10-$15/share plus value of $1 billion termination fee).**

**Solvency Certificate**

**TLDR:** Post earnings, Twitter is insolvent pro forma for $13 billion of new debt. If insolvent, can't close on $13 billion of financing which means merger can't close at $54.20/share and Musk is only on the hook for a $1 billion break up fee. Without the merger, Twitter goes to $11-$16/share.

I don't have anything against them; make your money. But the way the system works, if you want the squeeze to happen, EVERYONE (or a vast vast majority) have to hold. 

Like a week ago, people would be hated on for having 420 sell limits. And theoretically, that is true, because selling will drive the price down. But people DID sell, and those people made bank and are ""paper hands"".

The people with insane amounts of money are the most likely to be paper hands and sell once they make a profit. If you're a whale with 100k invested, you have so much more to lose than someone who YOLOed 400 dollars and can just hold forever. It sucks WAY more to see 100k go to 50k than 400 to 200.

Because of this contradiction, it is inherently extremely difficult to create a short squeeze because people want to reduce their risks and make money. I don't blame them.

16gmwf3,2023-09-12 09:41:00,Why Starbucks is losing to Luckin Coffee in China and why this likely won‚Äôt change.,"With Luckin‚Äôs 2nd Quarter earnings report, it‚Äôs impactful partnership with Moutai and soon with Victoria Secret, Luckin Coffee is making headlines for all the right reasons.  Yesterday‚Äôs CNBC headline ‚ÄúHow Luckin Coffee overtook Starbucks as the largest coffee chain in China‚Äù is turning even more heads.  As unbiased investors looking for opportunities it‚Äôs worth trying to understand where Starbucks lost ground and why Luckin is succeeding.

Starbucks has numerous disadvantages in China: 

-  Starbucks stores are largely in high-tier cities, so when Covid struck and these cities were being shut down, so too were more Starbucks. While Luckin Coffee does have stores in high-tier cities, they've largely targeted lower-tier cities. Major problem for Starbucks.

- Prior to Covid, Starbucks didn't have a well developed App for order and delivery. Luckin already did. So while Starbucks was playing catch-up, Luckin was expanding and building market share. Major problem for Starbucks.

- Starbucks stores are larger and designed to have a ""3rd space"". Luckin stores are small and efficiently designed for pick-up and delivery. So not only is Starbucks paying more for their real-estate but it costs more money and time to create a new store. In other words, Starbucks can't keep up with Luckin's growth, both in speed and the cost of development. Major problem for Starbucks.

- Luckin's selection of drinks cater more to Chinese tastes.

- Luckin is vertically integrated in China so they can reduce their prices and still profit.  Starbucks is seen as a luxury brand, so they can't reduce their prices too much without losing their identity as a luxury brand.

Over a year ago Luckin passed Starbucks in store count, now they've passed them in revenue.

What can't be forgotten is China's unique marketplace for coffee. It is literally the fastest growing coffee market in the world. In Starbucks entire history, they have never opened the number of stores Luckin has in one year - even globally! This isn't a knock on Starbucks, they deserve a great deal of credit for helping to develop the global coffee market, but the western coffee market is a mature one, and slow growing.  Meanwhile in China, things are just getting started.

Some of what I've listed above Starbucks might be able to fix, but not all of it. Going forward, I believe Starbucks will continue to lose market share to Luckin Coffee, making Luckin the better investment for investors.",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16gmwf3/why_starbucks_is_losing_to_luckin_coffee_in_china/,wallstreetbets

Is it just me or does this seem obvious? He doesn't actually have to go through with it, and the price will drop at that time if he doesn't.

This post is to offer a different perspective. Hopefully offering contrarian opinions is something that's still allowed on this sub.

1. You really don't feel that going from about $38 to more than $400 in a week is a short squeeze?
2. If you are one of those people that compares to VW, then...wouldn't Cohen joining the board be the catalyst? And, go look at the charts for yourself but instead of looking at screenshots here, ZOOM OUT on both charts. Looks like a short squeeze to me.
3. There was no evidence before GME of Robinhood having a desire to screw over retail investors. The CEO is a millenial...that's not their thing.
4. What there IS evidence of, is incompetence. Doesn't it seem more likely that the brokerage with a crayon interface that once allowed UNLIMITED FUCKING MARGIN simply didn't have the liquidity to handle something like this? And that the CEO is a fucking dumbass who didn't want to admit it on national tv?
5. Why would Citadel even need to pressure Robinhood to begin with? They could have easily seen this coming and prepared for it.
6. If you still believe Citadel was behind this, then RH isn't even the 'enemy' in this scenario anyway. It'd be the DTCC that ultimately made the decision to raise margins to 100%.
7. If you feel that Melvin was lying about covering their position when they actually didn't, then the silver lining is that this is blatant, obvious, and easily disproven. They ARE being investigated; So this would come out and it'd be a big fucking deal. Which makes me doubt they'd lie about something they have no ability to cover up.
8. You really should go look at other subs once in a while: Stocks, Stockmarket, Pennystocks, and Options. Contrarian opinions are allowed there. If nothing else, isn't more information before you make a financial decision a good thing?

Disclosure: I've had multiple positions on GME. Bought calls and puts, bought shares, sold covered calls using both shares and LEAPS as leverage. I made a lot of mistakes during the run, but have come out so far with about 150% profit (could have been over 1000% if I played it a lot better)",32,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfe7rn/robinhood_colluding_with_citadel_to_halt_buying/,wallstreetbets

ryqgub,2022-01-08 03:43:08,Moderna is probably the most vulnerable COVID vaccine company right now and why an aggressive short might make sense.,"Moderna is the example of a small company that has its entire wealth built around one thing: mRNA COVID vaccines. Before COVID, this company was on the brink of bankruptcy. As COVID vaccines reveal themselves to be much less efficacious that initially marketed and as Moderna vaccines are said to induce pretty severe side effects notably (see recommendations against it for young males in Europe), I see a potential aggressive short in this stock for 2022. They have a great ally though, and it's one of their patent holder: Anthony Fauci. But Fauci might become a handicap in the future for his potential role into gain of function research in China, his lies to Congress and his conflict of interests that absolutely no one can ignore. His fall into total disgrace might just be a matter of time (hopefully) and might drag Moderna with it. I could see the CEO progressively trying to exit. The dominoes might fall very quickly if it happens.
On the other side, the risk to the upside still exist. Moderna might manage to push other types of vaccines (cancer? other illnesses?) after its success in the COVID vaccines industry. Fauci might also manage to drag his possible prosecutions and remember, he has powerful allies himself.
Pfizer is another element to take into account. Moderna's main rival has a potential safe exit: their treatment named Paxlovid. Once Paxlovid is confirmed to be able to flood the world with a high price tag, Pfizer might not see the current vaccine propaganda to be as useful.
Another threat to Moderna is the actual development of a variant resistant vaccine. An example: https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2021/12/us-army-creates-single-vaccine-effective-against-all-covid-sars-variants/360089/

Let this be a warning to all STOP PUTTING ALL FAITH INTO THE HIVE MIND AND DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. GME is clearly on SEC's ""failure to deliver list"" on every day provided meaning they are still most likely being shorted, but AMC is apparently cleared after the 12th meaning they are probably no longer being shorted.

January 4th - AMC - 111,844 shares @ $2.12

January 5th - AMC - 1,631,091 shares @ $2.01

January 7th - AMC - 4,241,943 shares @ $2.01

January 8th - AMC - 11,547,981 shares @ $2.05

January 9-12th - AMC not on list

January 12th - AMC - 5900 shares @ $2.20

January 13-14th - AMC - not on list

I can see where the HYPE was coming from because apparently there was a failure to deliver 4M+ then 11M+ shares, but after that it looks like the ""shorters"" went on to short a much smaller supply. I guess there is still a possibility that the shorting continued, but I am having serious doubts. For those of you holding AMC, you might want to check into my claims to see that you and I got royally fucked. It's clearly not too big of a deficit if you need to sell, but you might want to sell if you have any profit left! unless you hold on to your shares with very little evidence of a future squeeze/potential (probably none). Maybe you'd like to hold onto until AMC becomes what they used to be (if that's possible), which I think I might do considering I bought in at 13 a piece. Anyway, hopefully this sparks a little controversy causing people to check my claim. I hope I'm wrong. BTW none of this is financial advise, do what you retards want

mydfv3,2021-04-25 17:48:26,$FSR Bear Update,"Hi! Me again üåàüêª, if you didn't see my first two posts ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maa6g3/fsr_is_worth_0_a_share/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/melf8c/fsr_updated_price_target_421/)), I have serious doubts about Fisker as a company.   Just wanted to pop back in with a couple updates.  My goal of these posts is to make sure that anyone investing in this company has a full grasp of the risks.  In their 10K that was (finally) filed, I grabbed two important pieces of information that I hadn't really discussed in depth.   I'll try to keep this short this time.

**Manufacturing Agreement:**

First, is that the reported deal with Magna International to manufacture the Ocean is not actually finalized.  It's more of an memorandum of understanding with a basic outline of terms.  So, the clock is ticking on their Q4 2022 production date, and they still don't have detailed terms with the manufacturer.  Who is also supposed to be performing the majority of the engineering, design, and testing of the car itself.

Might want to get moving on that.

**Manufacturing Agreement Terms:**

The terms of the above agreement are that Magna will get a series of warrants for FSR stock that are exerciseable upon three main milestones: (1) preliminary production spec, (2) detailed manufacturing agreement, (3) start of production. If fully exercised, these warrants amount to 6% ownership in Fisker.

Let that sink in.  If Magna produces a single Ocean, they own 6% of the company.  This (maybe?) makes sense for a long term strategic partnership, but Fisker has already announced that they want Foxconn to make their second car.  How much ownership does Foxconn get?  And if they make a third car?  Does everyone just get 6%?  So of course Magna made that deal.  No downside risk, and the upside is 6% of an EV company.

&#x200B;

As I said in a comment on my previous post,  I""ll be keeping an eye on May.  They had announced they'd have a production version of the Ocean ready for the LA Auto Show that was supposed to be in May 2021.  The show has been moved to November (Covid-19), but it will be telling if they debut a production ready Ocean on that original timeline, or if dates are already slipping.

I don't think this company leadership has any idea what it's doing.

lbhwf9,2021-02-03 06:59:27,Are you sure Melvin is still short GME? Because if they're not then you're all just playing with yourselves.,"Hi, former hedge fund trader here. First thing: In my 8 years trading for Wall street firms I never heard of anyone pulling this naked short selling shit like what happened with GME. In fact the only time I ever found myself naked short (accidentally) it was a huge problem, was almost fired, massive apologies to the prime broker, exchange, regulators etc. I certainly didn't make that mistake again. I can tell you that in Europe and Asia this kind of shit just doesn't fly. However, having seen the GME fail-to-deliver data on the SEC website, I'm pretty shocked that US markets appear to be riddled with corruption.

Second thing: If you're a trader or PM in a hedge fund and you mess something up then it is the golden rule that you get out immediately. You never let an error run or dilly-dally before making things right. It's my belief that this attitude permeates the entire industry. Ego, right or wrong, fair or unfair, they all go out the window and you take the loss, suffer the pain, and live to fight another day. 

Now let's consider what happened last week: GME  traded > 500m shares. If Melvin were covering at 1/4 volume it means they could have bought 125m shares. That's twice the floating market cap. As such I'd say Melvin is almost certainly out of this trade already.

In that case, you're all just playing with yourselves and the selloffs are a simple result of derivative brokers (eToro et al) running stops of leveraged customers. The only way to fix this is for retail to stop buying GME derivatives and instead buy real stock and hold.

Happy to hear any evidence that they're still short but beware the integrity of such data.

1baeb7i,2024-03-09 09:57:11,Why do people seem unconcerned about the bull run ending?," 

I'm beginning to see more and more signs of an impending crash, both in the stock market and beyond. It's possible that we are heading towards a crash of unprecedented proportions. I don't want to sound like those doomsday preachers with a bell in hand who once heralded the end of the world, but I increasingly feel that way as clear signs of something brewing are evident, and people seem to be blatantly ignoring it.

Let me start with the most obvious factor ‚Äì everything is incredibly expensive. After analyzing numerous companies using traditional methods, I couldn't find a reasonably valued stock. The S&P500 has surpassed its all-time high many times since the beginning of the year, and the chart is beginning to resemble a vertical wall. The entire market relies on NVIDIA, driven by AI and colossal expectations associated with it. The Shiller P/E ratio for the S&P500 (comparing the price of the S&P500 to the average annual earnings on S&P500 shares for the last 10 years adjusted for inflation) is at the same level as before the crash in 1929, and if it continues to rise, it will soon reach a level close to the crash of 2000/2001. People are buying stocks without asking, ""at what price?""

Another factor is the real estate market, which has never been so inflated. I'm not an expert, but when the whole world talks about how expensive houses are, and people take out loans based on very high interest rates, thinking it won't get any cheaper, it starts to scare me. Of course, I'm not afraid that houses will become cheaper, but rather what might cause it.

Next up are cryptocurrencies, whose recent rapid surges, in my opinion, signify the best indicator that the end of prosperity is near. The market is already so inflated that even the riskiest assets are gaining momentum at a very rapid pace.

I would also like to mention Warren Buffett's recent annual letter. Berkshire Hathaway currently has $167 billion in cash. When asked about his plans for it, Buffett replied, ""I plan to wait."" He added that financial markets can ""unpredictably stop and even disappear,"" as has happened in the past, and Berkshire, with its cash reserves, has the ""ability to respond"" to market downturns, which could be a ""great opportunity"" for the company. I get the impression that Buffett, too, expects a major crash but is hesitant to talk about it to avoid alarming less aware investors in his fund.

Lastly, I've saved my biggest concern for the end ‚Äì the specter of a third world war. As mentioned by a politician, if someone at a European summit were to mention the possibility of World War III in the past, their career would quickly come to an end. However, now it is one of the main topics at summit meetings. I fear that this could be the reason for the crash I'm talking about.",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1baeb7i/why_do_people_seem_unconcerned_about_the_bull_run/,wallstreetbets

Where did Tesla go wrong? The once red-hot electric automaker was considered to be a part of the Magnificent Seven, a collection of behemoth tech stocks with some pretty recognizable names. Now? Tesla is considered to be one of the worst-performing stocks of the entire S&P 500 during a time where we are seeing some of the highest highs in the market.¬†

Well, fasten your seatbelts because here we go:

2. The electric vehicle industry as a whole is becoming more **crowded** than ever before at the absolute **worst time** for the company, just as its fundamentals are coming into question. To date the company's share price has dropped more than **60%** from its 2021 all-time high of $407.
3. This cramped competition can be realized even further with the fact that China‚Äôs electric vehicle champion, BYD, has **overtaken** Tesla as the **largest** EV producer in the world, with a 22% increase in global sales for Q4 of last year, surpassing Tesla by over 41,000 units. This is bad news for Tesla as it begins to lose its **foothold** over the Asian region even further as its ***gap*** over the Chinese rival decreased from 400,000 units posted in 2022 to 230,000 units posted in 2023.
4. After **missing** expectations on the company's reported earnings earlier this year, it has become apparent that demand for electric vehicles has **declined** and is notably lower than last year. The company seems to be **stuck** between two major growth phases as it works on launching its next-generation vehicles. We can only hope that those new cars don‚Äôt have any major issues as the current generation of vehicles does; otherwise, Tesla could spiral into an even deeper rabbit hole than it currently is.

My high school classmates voted me ""Most Likely to Lose Virginity at a Massage Parlor in Thailand."" Please see below my thoughts on the (rather niche) meme stock Bed Bath & Beyond, which trades on the Nasdaq as $BBBY.

**Preface**

I'll admit it. I was initially drawn to this stock by nostalgia. I remember roaming these wide fluorescent aisles as a wonderstruck child, holding my mother's hand and nibbling on a Pokemon card. I remember the smells of the exotic lotions and the textures of the plush towels. It was pure opulence.

But wankery and nostalgia aside, it is my not-so-humble opinion that there are many, many reasons why this stock is a compelling gamble.

&#x200B;

* **Fresh Faces and Fresher Ideas**
   * The entire C-Suite was overhauled in 2020. The CEO was hired in November 2019, and literally every other exec was hired in 2020. They are not fucking around
   * 100% of the Board of Directors were appointed within the last 4 years
   * All the boomers that milked this company dry as it spiraled downward are gone
* **Shawty Got Techniques**
   * The new C-Suite is packed with Retail veterans with specific experience leading digital/e-commerce transformations. These are alumni from the likes of Target, Amazon, Nordstrom, Home Depot, Walgreens, Walmart, J. Crew, and Disney -- companies that have been set up exceptionally well to survive the 21st Century. There's also a Chief Digital Officer now
   * A quick browse of their job openings show just ambitious the turnaround really is. Open positions include cloud engineers, digital marketers, and warehouse fulfillment staff. They are also hiring beaucoup data scientists to mine consumer insights and optimize their supply chain
* **Omnipresent AF**
   * The website is officially an online shop, and has UI/UX for days. They even have an app you can shop with. Only the best of the best retailers have apps, it is known
   * They do all the things that multi-channel retailers should do, like same day delivery, store and curbside pickup, and free shipping on orders over $39
   * Wedding and baby registries. Let's face it, these are a social institution that aren't going away. $BBBY is one of the rare few retailers that offers pretty much everything a newly wed couple or a newborn might need

&#x200B;

* **A Structured Roadmap with Annual Milestones**
   * The $BBBY transformation is not just a bunch of buzzwords thrown into a vague vision statement. Management is executing on a 3-Year Roadmap that involves cutting costs by going lean and prioritizing investments in digital penetration
   * It's working: Gross margins increased from 26.7% to 34.9% over the past year. Digital penetration of sales revenue increased from 18% in FY18Q1 to 38% in FY21Q1
   * Demonstrated results are real, unlike the castles in the sky that speculative SPACs promise

&#x200B;

* **An Iconic Brand Seared Into The American Subconscious**
   * This bullet speaks for itself really. You and everyone you know has heard of $BBBY. $BBBY is love. $BBBY is life.
* **Taking the Shitty Horses Behind the Barn and Shooting Them. Running the Litty Horses in the Races**
   * Aggressively selling underperforming business units such as Cost Plus World Market, One Kings Lane, and PMall
   * Aggressively growing overperforming business units such as Buybuy Baby, Harmon, and Decorist
   * Aggressively investing in the cash cows that are private label brands. Retailers from CostCo to Amazon know how fucking milkable private label brands are for juiced revenues, especially when they're sharing shelf space with more established brands. After all, you are who you spend time with. $BBBY have launched 3 of these brands so far this year, with plans to launch 3 more next quarter. They are aiming for 30% private label sales penetration by FY23
* **The ESG Boost**
   * Publicly committed to net zero emissions by 2040
   * Investing heavily in water efficiency, waste recycling, and sustainable and responsible sourcing throughout their supply chain
   * They are also investing in diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace. This is coming from the top-down, because 7 out of 13 board directors are women and 5 out of 8 C-Suite execs are women and/or BIPOC. ESG investors lap this kinda shit up. Also a McKinsey study found that businesses who outperformed industry peers on racial and ethnic diversity were also statistically likely to outperform financially
   * The recent boom in impact investing, combined with social pressures on institutional investors, has definitely boosted demand for ESG-oriented stocks. $BBBY is well-positioned to benefit from this trend
* **Financials**
   * Positive, growing EBITDA
   * Extremely healthy cash position of $1.35 Billion. Long-term debt of $1.19B is lower
   * Free cash flow and operating cash flow are positive and trending upwards. Very bullish
   * Net income has been negative in recent years but was finally positive in the trailing twelve months. As a result net income margin and operating margin are still relatively low (although positive)
   * Current ratio of 1.56 is very healthy
   * Management is confident enough to regularly buy back shares. They clearly care about their shareholders. They used to pay a dividend before COVID as well, but it is not clear if/when this will be reinstated
* **Potential Catalysts**
   * A huge catalyst this summer is college shopping as in-person attendance picks up. Thanks to COVID, essentially 2+ years worth of students will be moving out from their parents' place and into college for the first time
   * The turnaround may be a 3 year plan, but investors will continue to reward the stock as long as management keeps meeting milestones.
   * All in all, keep an eye out for FY21Q2 earnings in a couple months. Could see a major move upward. I plan to build out my position by then
   * If inflation is indeed not transitory, and we are headed for a market downturn, people are still going to buy pillows and blankets and shit. Consumer cyclical stocks are good during inflation

**The Bear Case**

Unlike certain bag holders on this sub (cough cough CLOV CLNE WISH cough cough), I can admit that this is definitely a gamble. This is not a sure thing. Upside could be limited, because big money investors are starting to be bullish on the turnaround too.

And, of course, the turnaround may fall flat. Amazon exists. Retail/e-commerce is a dog fuck dog world, and Amazon is bigass dog in a smallass doggy day care. Revenue is on a long-term downtrend, and management is yet to demonstrate that they can surpass the performance from the brick and mortar glory days of yore.

Also, my credibility is suspect. I'm emotional, impulsive, and honestly -- despite my obvious and staggering genius -- I do a lot of dumb shit. So don't just take my word on this. Follow your heart.

Sars-Cov-2 is a chimera (genetic splicing of different viruses/organisms)

It is 96% identical to Bat corona-virus RaTG13. Most of the differences are found in the Receptor-Binding Motif (RBM). This is the RNA that is responsible to make the S2 Glyco-protein (the thing that attaches to the ace2 receptor to infect your cells). 

If you just look at just the RBM Sars-Cov-2 is almost identical to a Pangolin Corona virus MP789 from Guangdong.

The things I just told you are all known by the public. The consensus that is being publicly spoken about is that these two virus or mutated variations of them infected the same host in the wet market in Wuhan and through genetic recombination created the BatSoup Virus we have today. Which would absolutely be possible. But here is where is gets fucked.... 

&#x200B;

Lady's (maybe...) and Autists I present to you the smoking gun...

https://preview.redd.it/szgz695e4bx41.png?width=1132&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5339c11500b523929869753543703302866140

That image is an amino acid (AA) comparison between all 3 viruses. Each letter represents a different AA. The red letters are where the AA's are different between the strains being compared. The smoking gun is the highlighted four AA series PRRA. Underneath that are 4 red stars indicating an insertion. While this can happen naturally, it is highly unlikely this is the case. Especially since this little 4 AA insertion is incredibly important and the reason why Sars-Cov-2 is highly transmissible.

&#x200B;

The amino acid after PRRA is R. This forms the sequence RRAR. RRAR is what is called a polybasic ferin cleavage site. Ferin is a special molecule in our bodies and it goes around and finds these site and cuts the amino acid chain at the cleavage site. Now the author goes into detail on the mechanisms but i don't really understand it. Basically it makes the virus highly transmissible and virulent. 

&#x200B;

Adding these cleavage sites is very common in Gain of Function research. Where scientist make virus more functional in human models to anticipate future threats and make therapeutics to counter these phenomena. My theory is that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was playing around in the lab and forgot to clean their shoes and this got out accidentally. When the Chinese found out they tried to keep it a secret and that's how it spread world-wide.

&#x200B;

This is the evidence that trump has been talking about about this virus coming from a lab. If I found this in between jerking off and being a degenerate on Robinhood then it's only a matter of time before it's on every news station around the world. That's when the next leg down starts.

&#x200B;

Panic will set in again after this comes out and the virus tears us a new one when we start to open up again. This is what will give the bears their strength.

I am wondering how long this stocks rally last. Even if it seems that inflation has slowed down, according to the news the Federal Reserve seems still intentioned to raise the interest rates at the end of January. Do you think that in such a case, the prices will drop one more time?

10cwyst,2023-01-15 22:26:51,Is TSLA a buy?,"Two years ago, it was pretty clear that Tesla was overvalued. Its P/E ratio was significantly higher than its competitors. In fact, the company was worth more than General Motors, Ford, and Toyota combined. Tesla seemed poised to eventually compete with the established automakers but investors seemed to think that Tesla would eventually become a monopoly. Tesla did better than expected in 2020 but it seemed like investors overshot the new reality. And it seems like I was right to be fearful when investors were greedy on TSLA.

From two years ago, the stock has gone down by 58.27%. The P/E ratio is now 37.78. The thing to note about Tesla is that it's really a tech stock and it should be treated as such. Tech stocks tend to have higher P/E ratios because investors anticipate higher revenue growth. Another thing worth noting is that while the stock price has fallen, earnings have gone up. In 2020, Tesla made roughly $31.5 billion with $6.6 billion in gross profit and just under $2 billion in operating income. Over the past 12 months, Tesla has made $74.8 billion in revenue, $19.9 in gross profit, and $12.5 billion in operating income. The P/E ratio is much higher in Tesla than its competitors which is 2-10. However, compared to other tech companies, Tesla is rather tame. Amazon is at 89.2. Even its competitor, Walmart, is at 44.7.

Tesla has much higher growth potential than its competitors, being a first mover in electric vehicles. Its competitors are largely well established and are not growing as quickly as Tesla. Tesla has already established itself as an EV brand. The question is whether its competitors can make the switch towards electric vehicles to hold their own against Tesla.",0,0.46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10cwyst/is_tsla_a_buy/,wallstreetbets
ovrkt5,2021-08-01 12:52:56,China is playing the long-game; US is running on band-aids,"China is not trying to kill their big tech, they are trying to make their business models more long-lived and sustainable both financially and socially.

It is definitely trying hard to create a more conservative financial system while contributing to a more equal distribution of wealth. Say what you want, but that ain't bad news at all if you're a long term investor.

China wants to rely less on foreign fund flows because they see high speculation and bubble activity in Western countries and they don't want their domestic companies to be exposed to that euphoria and collapse risk. It's easy for a company to act recklessly in such an environment, and these reckless acts might ruin the Government's efforts towards a stable and healthy growing market.

Remember, China is a country lead by a collectivist mindset where the good of the mass is more important than the good of a single company or individual (which will frequently lead to abuse of the few for the many, in direct opposition to the policy of the US government which easily sacrifices the many for the few on top (not so much Western Europe). In the end the collective good turns out to be the company's best interest too.

They are not oblivious to the effects these measures have on the markets, even going as far as to post ads on the front page of every newspaper claiming that they are not in any way trying to harm tech companies, but actually helping them become more sustainable and resilient.

&#x200B;

Was the crackdown on education stocks really a surprise?

In April the government released a document analyzing the education system of the country and already pointing out the problems they saw and possible corrective measures.

If somebody read those (and they should have if they owned the companies) they could have anticipated the sector to be caught in the regulation crossfire. But people don't do their due diligence and always act surprised when things go south. China is always clear about its intentions, we're just unable to understand them because we keep thinking in Western terms and taking our society and the companies we know as the ""default"" condition, which is fundamentally wrong.

Was the crackdown on Didi a surprise too?

Absolutely not. The government had explicitly recommended Didi delayed their IPO until certain data issues had been dealt with. Their main concern was making sure data breaches were avoided since, well, the US is literally their main competitor.

Didi ignored all this and went ahead. What followed was more than expected.

&#x200B;

I'm not pretending their totalitarian government that seeks to have absolute control over everything and every piece of information and conducts ethnic cleansing is in any way the most advanced form of human governance.

I'm simply pointing out that it is doing what it is doing because it wants to secure a strong and steady growth for its companies, and it knows that can only be achieved if it does not come at the expense of impoverishing its population and compromising healthy competition and fair-play in all sectors.

Only the western investor deeply embroiled in never-ending ATH's and euphoria can view the sustainable long-term measures as unsustainable and the unsustainable short-term bandaids as sustainable.

I wrote an article 2 months ago about why WSB was running the equity markets. I explained how the rise of passive investing (ala Mike Green's thesis) was making it so that the marginal mover of capital was entirely passive, and this is leading to a war between retail (WSB) and hedge funds for the valuation of markets and basically the winner gets to lead the sheep (the passive money). It explains the massive run-up of Tesla/Nio and the endless bids from the likes of vanguard funds once they reach certain market cap hurdles. I won't go into this in depth. Those who wish to find out more should read my previous post and go look up Mike Green from Logica. 

I won't go into details on the gamma convexity squeeze dynamics, and how it is enhancing a lot of momentum and creating feedback loops, for those who want to read more, I would recommend Chris Cole of Artemis capital to talked about this dynamic in the podcast **End Game** with Grant William.

This time around, I will talk about two misconceptions of the market surrounding GME. I will talk about why attacking hedge funds like they are part of the establishment is also pretty misguided. And I will will go over my thoughts on what will happen next.  

**GME Misconceptions**

The two misconceptions on GME have to do with manipulation of GME shares by the brokers and that they are having to do this because the short sellers are trapped in an infinite money black hole. The problem with this narrative is that it ignores some fundamental understanding about how buying shares work. The prevention of GME buying really has nothing to do with market manipulation in collusion with Citadel or Melvin or any market makers. The fact is that the market makers are running trillion dollar flow books and couldn't care less, and Robinhood is not a broker for any hedge funds. The real reason is that some of these smaller brokers don't have enough working capital to fund the required collateral by clearing houses (which was raised on them over the past few days), this is why the largest guys like Fidelity didn't have that issues. Which is why many brokers are drawing down their banking lines (such as Robinhood drawing down $1 billion from banks). Once they bring on enough liquidity, they will enable them again, but until then, we still live in a T+2 settlement world in which brokers have working capital needs. The implementation was retarded, but the brokers basically panicked when they saw their working capital deplete rapidly.

The other misconception has to do with WSB finding in infinite money wormhole. Trust me, I was there when a relative value Fund I interned at in 2009 basically went bust when a short selling ban was implemented. I was there when the Italian banks were on the verge of collapse, sitting on my 10x delta puts with a seven figure paper profit as a 26 year old when Draghi announced LTRO and blew my portfolio up. There are a lot of things that would stop the infinitely money machine, especially if you have been around long enough and have seen all the games being played. One such way is that management can simply issues new shares (likely through a privately placement deal with the short seller consortium), and the likelihood goes up the more the price goes up. Another way is that the SEC could step in and put a short term trading halt while forcing the short sellers into a deal with mgt. 

**Misplaced Hatred of Hedge Funds**

If one looks around the financial landscape today, Hedge funds are actually a dying breed. The young put about 80% of their capital to work in passive while the boomers that are exiting have historically placed about 80% of their capital to work in active funds. As a result, since about  2008, active managers such as mutual funds and hedge funds had actually been dying, even though they played almost no role during the 2008 GFC. If anything, many hedge funds identified problems in the system way earlier and most of the people in the big short were successful hedge fund managers. The problem was that the rise in passive and the fed had manipulated price signals so much so that one cannot actually make money arbitraging value (long undervalued, short overvalued) in a world less and less flow cares about value. 

The narrative being promoted by those who do not understand markets is that these evil hedge funds were shorting stocks, bankrupting companies and forcing layoffs. This could not be further from the truth. The value of a share in a secondary market has no impact on the day to day business of a company. A company could trade at 0 value, but if it generates healthy profits and has a strong balance sheet, it will keep going, hiring people and expanding. The truth is that these ""evil"" hedge funds were managing long short books. They were owning things like Facebook, Apple or it could be distressed debt they thought were undervalued, they were hedging their long book with things they think could go bust in the event of an economic downturn/crisis. 

**What Happens Next**

The effects of the GME short squeeze should not be underestimated, not because of the money lost by shorts on its position of somewhere around $20 billion (that's peanuts in financial markets terms). The full ramification is actually on the long side, from hedge funds who no longer feel like they can hedge out their downside by shorting fundamental unsound companies. I would not be surprised if the action in the markets in the past several days is just the beginning of large unwind because hedge funds will have to now reduce their risk position in their longs, the ramification of which will be in the hundreds of billions to trillions. It could very well be that this de-risking by active managers will lead to the start of a larger correction in the broader market. And as we have seen during the March selloff, without active managers who have cash on their books, who are the buyer of last resort, but instead passive flow, who actually tend to go bid-less in a market crash, we could see increasing volatility the likes we have never seen before. 

If the market does crash, congress may blame this on ""reckless speculators"" and ban option trading for those under certain income/networth thresholds. just as hedge funds are being scapegoated for 2008 despite being innocent, retail may be scapegoated for the next crash despite the real driver of volatility being the rise of passive money. The lack of retail participation in options may mean that he gamma squeeze dynamics will end. 

I have taken off most of my long positions and am sitting on cash and reloading VIX calls and some weekly ATM SPX puts.  Congraduations, you autists have beaten hedge funds (who are more like whales being hunted to extinction than fierce sharks) in the first major battle, but have set yourself to lose one of your most important tools (gamma squeeze). I would suggest taking out your gains and buying downside protection, maybe you'll gamma squeeze the market into a 50% correction and turn yourself into a high-net-worth (HNW) so you can bypass any future retail restrictions.",97,0.57,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qx8p/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/,wallstreetbets

People view $AMC the same way they view $GME - just another brick & mortar Mall company that is essentially being destroyed by $AMZN Prime, HBO Max, and Disney+. Fair enough, but I enjoy watching a new release in IMAX with a flatbread pizza in one hand, and a flavored Coke in my other. I think many others do to.

To address everyone who doesn't care about IMAX or going to theaters, $AMC has to simply do ONE VERY SIMPLE THING that will literally blow the minds of the un-imaginative analysts who are predicting doom.  All $AMC has to do is rename ""**AMC Theatres On Demand**"", the program they started in 2019, to **AMC+**.

AMC+ will be a studio-independant platform for movies, documentaries and TV shows. No monthly fee, but rather an revenue-sharing a la carte pricing system. Of course I'd love to see $AMC poach some talent from $NFLX or $DIS when they announce AMC+. One can dream!

TL;DR- $AMC can pivot hard by simply relaunching their existing ""AMC Theatres On Demand"" to AMC+.

l90vcc,2021-01-31 01:13:58,GME devil's advocate,"Alright, this is going to be brutal on karma. I'm confident this will get downvoted to hell, but fuck it.

Early GME holders (people who bought <$50 or so), you can keep walking. You're all most likely safe and will profit from your holdings and trades.

People who're buying GME at current levels, maybe I'll be completely wrong and you'll make a million and cash out at the top and lose nothing... or maybe, I'll be right and it will be loss porn galore for days. I'm leaning towards the second.

**Here's why,**

GME is trading at a ridiculous premium, short squeeze or not, gamma squeeze or not. If you're buying in now, you might see a few days, or even a few weeks worth of green that will be life-changing... but most of you will end up losing to an enemy you don't even think you're playing against. I'll explain this in a bit.

Right now, the general public and especially WSB consensus is that GME is going to keep squeezing because of 100%+ short interest, and that's a fundamentally valid reason, but those who are buying these GME shares, where do you think they're coming from? Here's a hint.

Initially, Melvin and Shitron were the primary shorters. They shorted the stock around $10 or so, thus making their max profit $10/share if GME had gone bankrupt. But as you keep squeezing higher, and even worse, as you keep buying at higher prices... Though Melvin and Shitron would be forced to close positions with hefty losses (I say would because I don't know for a fact that they already have despite what CNBC says), many other hedge funds would've opened new ones. Now, why the fuck would they do that? Simple, you gave them an opportunity to short a stock that was worth $10 a few months back, and is now 30x that... raising potential returns by at least 30x. Of course, the stock doesn't even have to go back to $10, even at $50 or $100 newly opened shorts would see sizable returns, and the only people who get truly hurt will be the ones who longed at these ridiculous levels.

Think about it., who do you think keeps lending out more shares to the retail investor? New hedge funds who previously had no skin in the game, or had a very small position at best!!! You don't think you're playing against them, but you are. The energy and focus seem so concentrated on Melvin and the gang that you don't even realize there are vultures waiting for a complete bloodbath.

Eventually, time will come when profit-seekers (with long positions) will begin entering the market, or when retail investors would've exhausted their capital and the price will come tumbling down faster than gravity taking hold of vulture shit falling from the sky. It will be a matter of a few thousand shares entering and the domino effect will bring it all down in a matter of days, maybe even hours.

The fuck am I trying to say? Well, I'm not advocating for a liquidation here, and neither am I telling you to stop buying. That decision is yours to make with the information you gather. All I'm saying is look around for more enemies as prices keep skyrocketing. You, the retail investor, are walking through the valley of beasts with every intention to make the rich bastards pay, but just know, there are a lot more of them gathering around this battle with each $ GME goes up... and not a single one of them stands agnostic, they've all got a bet open and it's most likely against you at these levels. This is becoming as much an opportunity of a lifetime on the short side, as it was on the long side when the stock was in single digits.

A lot of you are pushing the whole SLV Citadel conspiracy theory. If anyone talks about why silver is a good play they get called a hedge fund bot trying to distract from GME.

Maybe you people calling silver a scam are the real Citadel shills. I mean, you are distracting from GME and you are trying to allocate funds to stocks that Citadel has calls in. It seems like some of you are just pushing the tickers you have positions in.

This means that the company is worth half of it was which doesn't add up, because that would mean its growth would be cut in half which still yet doesn't make sense since its a value stock.

&#x200B;

Since its a value stock we now can assume that HALf of its value is no longer there which is NOT the case for FB as Revenue will seemingly never go down to far much rather the company will keep moving by increasing what the organization does, such as the metaverse and purchasing start up's. The main problem that has happened is a small decrease in daily users which makes sense because they already have half of the human population on the app, so we can expect seeing not as much huge new users incoming, and expect more expansion of the app and the brand it self.

We've seen this before back in 2018 of July where the Company reported bad earnings and the stock went to decrease to almost 40% which almost took it 1 year to recover but the stock never was able to fully recover and grow until january of 2020.

Final words is that FB is simply undervalued right now and this is a way to low of a buying price that I will holding for the mid-long term recover, even if it goes down further.

You‚Äôd be forgiven for having never heard of JD.com outside of Asia. JD is an online e-commerce company that is largest direct retailer in China.

Why am I bullish?

Well. Let‚Äôs do some comparisons against the boomer bae that is Amazon:

Amazon market cap: $1.52T

Amazon revenue 2020: $386bn

Amazon net profit: $21.33bn

JD market cap $130bn

JD revenue 2020: $114bn

JD net profit:$7.59bn

So, in comparison JD is valued x12 less than Amazon but is already generating 1/3 of the revenue and net profits in an online market that is set to expand rapidly over the next decade as more of China gains internet usage. 

Internet usage stats by population:
China: 63%
USA: 96%

Absolute no brainer.

18fiael,2023-12-11 00:55:58,Why the CT is bullish and your feelings don‚Äôt matter.,"TLDR: It has better specs than competitors, Tesla is most likely not losing money on it, Tesla will most likely be able to reach 25k production rather fast. 

Ford has had the lightning, Rivian the RT1, and GM technically sells the Hummer but we won‚Äôt be including that for obvious reasons. And then there‚Äôs CT, the truck everyone on Reddit hates. Although CT is actually the better vehicle in most cases or at the very least comparable. 

**Specs**

Range: RT1 wins by ~15 miles, while Ford is far behind. 

Towing cap: RT1 and CT tie

Rivian and Tesla are pretty neck and neck for most ‚Äútruck specs‚Äù like towing, torque, HP. But Tesla has a larger bed capacity at 2,500lbs vs Rivians 1,760lbs. 

Price: There are no outliers, all have comparable price options. Ford has the lowest priced option, but it has far lower specs than what we‚Äôre comparing. 

Cargo: CT wins by 20% given it comes stock with a lockable bed. But it has comparable storage without the bed. It also has the longest bed by almost 6 inches but it‚Äôs also the skinniest by 2in. 

Ground clearance: CT wins, Ford is a low rider with almost 10in less than CT. 

CT has better battery efficiency, but the RT1 is extremely aerodynamic. The RT1 is top of the list for aero and overall efficiency. 

Top speed, HP, Bidirectional, are all comparable. Ford being the worst in most cases. 

**CT has many other features that the other two don‚Äôt** and they‚Äôre cooler than the RT1 gear tunnel. Steer by wire, is not new tech but it‚Äôs new to trucks and iirc is only in a handful of vehicles. Reviews are glowing and the industry has been wanting to switch for a while. 

Rear wheel steering, makes the turning radius of CT smaller than the model S. it also helps with merging on highways. 

*800 volt* architecture. This isn‚Äôt a new thing but it‚Äôs not common and is very important. It means lower current, less wires, more efficient and lighter vehicle. It also means faster charging. The industry has wanted to do this for a while too but hasn‚Äôt. Many will follow. This is part of the reason why CT is lighter than both competitors while being covered in steel. 

Also a 48v system vs 12v like most vehicles. This shares similar benefits as above. 

Although it‚Äôs kind of a meme, CT also has an extended battery option that sits in the front of the bed similar to a tool box. It‚Äôs actually a great deal in terms of onboard battery storage and adds over 100miles of range iirc. Great if you would normally use the truck for its onboard power. 

It‚Äôs hardened, scratch proof, and lack of paint will make it great for working conditions. Plus now tesla can‚Äôt fuck up your paint on delivery. No more rock chips and you probably won‚Äôt ever have to replace any windows, no more smash-n-grabs. 

Infotainment screen in the back seat for passengers. And the largest screen on the market in the front. 

This is somewhat subjective but Fords software and general UI/UX is arguably well below Tesla and Rivian standards. 

Rivian and Tesla both come equipped with advanced cruise control systems. I don‚Äôt know much about Rivians capabilities. 

**DD**

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing things. But based on specs, the Cybertruck is the better truck. **The issue is the way it looks.** As we‚Äôve seen on Reddit, everyone thinks it looks terrible. Personally I love the way it looks. 

I‚Äôm not going to speculate and try and guess how many people might be turned off enough by its looks to not buy it. But we can assume that Tesla will be able to produce a lot of them. Castings are not new to Tesla, these are much larger but even if they‚Äôre able to ramp at a fraction of the speed of model Y ramp in Shanghai they‚Äôll be making far more than 100k/year soon. Tesla has said it is possible to hit 250k in two years. 

GM isint in this conversation because they can‚Äôt make anything with a battery, Ford only made 15k last year and rivian made 25k. Both companies are losing a massive amount of money on every sale. 

Tesla did say they‚Äôd sell CT at a loss if needed, which would imply Tesla isn‚Äôt in a loss yet. But given all the new tech I find it a little hard to believe they‚Äôre making much on the $80k trim. They‚Äôd most likely lose money selling their low trim currently, which would explain why they aren‚Äôt selling it. 

With all that said, I strongly believe the CT will be the best selling EV truck rather soon. And will remain there until another more traditional company matches Teslas production.

There‚Äôs also a good chance opinions change around its look once more are on roads and other manufacturers make more ‚Äúradical‚Äù looking cars. If this happens there‚Äôs little reason to think the CT won‚Äôt be a top seller within EV trucks longterm. 

Overall I always thought CT would be great for the company and stock, and after seeing its spec I still feel the same way. 

If I‚Äôve made any mistakes in my comparison please point it out.",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18fiael/why_the_ct_is_bullish_and_your_feelings_dont/,wallstreetbets
vs6zsw,2022-07-05 20:12:28,"Stefan Semanov, up $50m from GME shorts.","[The face of evil](https://ibb.co/Kr0Qn6q)

>‚ÄùApes are poor and stupid‚Äù -Stefan Semanov

**Backstory:**

Semanov studied philosophy under Karl Popper at the Russian School of Economics, but he abandoned his plans to become a philosopher. He joined the London merchant bank Singer & Friedlander. In 1976 he moved to New York City, where he worked initially as an analyst of European securities and rapidly made his mark.

**Financial career**

In 1983 Semanov established the Semanov Fund (later Quantos Endowment Fund), a hedge fund that subsequently spawned a range of associated companies. His daring investment decisions caused the funds to grow rapidly, but not all his gambles succeeded. He correctly foresaw the worldwide stock market crash of October 1987‚Äîbut wrongly predicted that Japanese stocks would fall hardest of all.

Semanov‚Äôs status as an almost mythical financier was established in September 1992 when the British government devalued the pound sterling. Through his Quantum group of companies, Semanov had sold billions of pounds during the days preceding devaluation, much of it purchased with borrowed money. 

Afterward Semanov bought back pounds, repaid the money he had borrowed, and made a profit of about $1 billion. Others also profited from the pound‚Äôs fall, but the scale of Semanov‚Äôs operations dwarfed those of everyone else, and the gambit earned him the nickname ‚Äúthe man who broke the Bank of Russia.‚Äù In 1994, however, his instincts appeared to fail him‚Äîat least temporarily‚Äîas he speculated that the dollar would rise in value against the Japanese yen. Instead, the dollar fell all year, and the Quantum Fund reportedly lost hundreds of millions on a single day in February.

**CURRENT:**

Latest 13F filings show that Semanov has taken a rather large short position against $GME, to the sum of **$100,000,000**, of which he is currently up $50m.

But that‚Äôs not all - he has many ties to BCG, and has made the bulk of his fortune shorting companies into bankruptcy (Radioshack, Toys R Us, Blockbuster are the three most noteworthy) and his portfolio now has both GME and BBBY shorts, aswell as some defense stocks (BA, RTX, RBLX.)

Stefan Semanov has made **far more profit** shorting $GME than Citadel. Stefan Semanov is an evil man.

#TL;DR Stefan Semanov is an evil man who is up $50m on $GME shorts

nxyi8r,2021-06-12 04:29:10,I have been looking at WWE stock recently and I think it's undervalued right now.,"https://i.lensdump.com/i/ZgNacv.jpg

Covid and the absence of the top star, Becky Lynch had an affect on the stock price of WWE. This is a fact. (Refer to linked img)

Wrestlemania 38 is next year's biggest Pay Per View to take place in Texas, the home state of legend and icon, ""Stone Cold Steve Austin"".

For those who don't know who he is or follow wrestling, Austin was the most popular star in all of pro wrestling back in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Rock and Stone Cold had the greatest feuds ever, and their WM matches were legendary and very exciting to watch. Arguably more popular than Hulk Hogan during his 80s and early 90s run, it's safe to say next year the stock of WWE will reach new highs.

Stone Cold will make some sort of return next year, but not as a wrestler since he has been retired since 2003.

Next year will be a large show, since vaccination rates all across the U.S. should be over 70% but likely closer to 90%. This would mean MANY fans will be in attendance. The live shows for the weekly RAW, NXT and SD will bring in lots of money and the stock will clearly rebound.

I also predict by next April, Becky Lynch will most likely return before or at WrestleMania 38. She already has a kid, and so I'm sure she would have found a babysitter for her girl by then. She made a lot of money during her rise to the top of the company since 2018, so she can easily afford one.

I will be buying some January calls on Monday or Tuesday, assuming it's a red day again. I think $80 strike for Jan 2022 is a safe bet. Once April options are available, I will buy $90 calls for that month.",0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxyi8r/i_have_been_looking_at_wwe_stock_recently_and_i/,wallstreetbets
slndrm,2022-02-06 02:15:17,"""F"" - Ford $50 Price Target!!!! , TSLA - $500 Price Target!!!!","**Product Line**

Tesla have limited product line when it comes to EV‚Äôs, their most popular one model 3 and Y whereas Ford has better product line both in Consumer and Commercial including MachE, F-150 lighting and commercial EV vehicles. Ford is racing ahead in the commercial EV line and already has contracts with Walmart and others. Ford has the capability to deliver the commercial vehicles in 2022 -23 to businesses. 

**Margins**

Tesla‚Äôs biggest strength is their margins -Gross margin ‚Äì 30%, Net Margin- 15% - 17% .Ford has lower margins (Gross ‚Äì 15%, Net -8%) because they have lived in the old ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) world of lower margins However that‚Äôs changing and will change the path of Ford history of margins. The new blood in Ford has learned to focus and reduce the margins from Tesla itself and they are working to reduce cost and increase margins. Most likely they will take margins to next level in 2-3 years. 

**Valuation & Market Share** 

The most controversial point that has jaded the most of us. Tesla has 900 billion valuation vs Ford‚Äôs barely $79 billion valuation. Given that Tesla‚Äôs revenue of 2021 - $53 Billion vs Fords $136 billion revenue. Ford being veteran and a value stock with dividends has been given lowest multiples of PE , Price to share for years because people never  thought that they would change or start a new product line, That‚Äôs changing now!! 

Tesla has 70% market share in EV market and Ford with 5% but that‚Äôs about to change drastically. In a matter of couple of years Tesla will loose their ground in EV landscape and Ford will increase its market share to over 15% with their aggressive line of EV‚Äôs 

¬∑**Moat**

Tesla had the moat with its manufacturing batteries, EV‚Äôs and automation. With time and effort that‚Äôs diluting and other auto manufactures have been able to manage to produce EV‚Äôs and batteries and eventually they will reach to automation as well. Ford is in the best position to beat Tesla in terms of higher quality EV, batteries and automation. 

**Marketing**

Tesla resonates with urban people and millennials which is good but Ford being 100-year-old firm comes with huge brand name and solid loyal customers. Fords new line of EV marketing and advertising has already done excellent job and proof is that they have over 270,000 orders within an year!!

 **High Interest rate Environment** 

We are moving in high interest rate environment with global rate increases. Tesla is still labeled as growth stock in portfolio baskets and Ford has value stock label for decades. Ford has been rewarding shareholders with dividends. This high interest rate environment is better for Ford and Tesla will see winter. 

¬∑**Team**

Last but not the least. Obviously, Tesla has proven for years being a solid team of technologist and path breakers under musk leadership. Ford‚Äôs new CEO Jim Farley is best CEO ford has got in over several decades. Jim has clarity of vision and can execute that vision with smart and effective decisions. Within period of an year or so, he has taken steps to transform Ford to be a New age Auto manufacturer",0,0.47,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/slndrm/f_ford_50_price_target_tsla_500_price_target/,wallstreetbets

l95pvf,2021-01-31 05:39:28,Potential Endgame Scenario: GameStop issues SOME shares and negotiates the best price on our behalf.,"So this started with me being worried that GameStop would issue shares to Melvin at a price of their choosing and walk away with billions, leaving us holding the bag (or at least prevent the short squeeze). But that's just the thing: While they DO want to use this opportunity to better capitalize, they DON'T want to piss us off after what is currently happening to Robinhood. IPO? Nope. Solvency? We'll see. So how does Gamestop take advantage of this spike in share price while simultaneously not pissing off an angry mob of retards who have already been fucked repeatedly?

Here's my idea: If the short interest is 120% of shares, Gamestop issues an amount of shares representing ONLY that additional ""20%"". And you may say ""Why negotiate a price?"" Because GameStop has a legal responsibility to negotiate the best possible price for the organization and its shareholders (many of us included). So they could issue 12 millionish shares at $2500/share ($30 billion to the books), while allowing all of us to realize those same gains.

""But what about the squeeze?"". That's the benefit of having a publicly traded company doing the negotiations, all kinds of financial models will be used to determine what the price of the squeeze, future interest, etc. would have cost, and it would be factored into the negotiated price.

Thoughts? Holes? Additions?

Position: 16 shares GME, diamond handed.

Edit: I'm being told my example of ""20%"" is way too high for what Gamestop is actually able to issue. If anyone is able to explain why they couldn't get more authorized, or what the maximum value they COULD issue is, I'll update.

üíéüôåüíéüöÄüöÄüöÄ My bad, typed it on desktop.

Edit 2: General responses have been, outside of me being a üåàüêª corporate shill, that GameStop can only issue $100m worth of shares now, which would barely dilute it and may actually help drive up the price more. The other point is that they can technically issue up to 240m more shares, but it would take weeks to move through the process to authorize more. Would appear my concerns are unwarranted in the short term.",54,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l95pvf/potential_endgame_scenario_gamestop_issues_some/,wallstreetbets

3. Autoship sales up 34% YOY

kzfmmc,2021-01-17 21:37:22,$TWTR appears to be a good potential buy üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ,"This is not financial advice. Trades should not be made on the information presented below. You should do your own DD. Everything below is a matter of opinion and is subject to change, and should be verified. This is also my first DD, so I apologize in advance for mistakes that may be present below. If you do see anything, please call it out in the comments.

Twitter ($TWTR) appears to be on sale, with good signs of upside. Twitter's share price has fallen substantially in light of allegations of censorship and removing Trump from their platform. Other firms in big tech have also experienced similar scrutiny by taking similar steps in light of recent events (i.e. FB and the Zucc). This has left shares on sale, with some appearingly positive buy signals on $TWTR.

Bull Case: Recent price trends and technicals may give an indication for price projections in the near future. While WSB might not like TA, I think it can be useful for making price projections, especially when used in conjunction with evidence from times it has worked previously.

&#x200B;

[red = low where we are; blue = two other interesting lows](https://preview.redd.it/nojbl40jbyb61.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=e35f91ec51393a44e36e1a02981f35a80efd8ff0)

The stock has a strong up trend-line (support, blue) that is touched 3-4 times over the duration of the pandemic rally (March-Present). The two blue arrows signify two important times this support has been touched previously and reversal ensues. At these two points, it also touches or partially penetrates the ichimoku cloud, which can act as an additional support level. Both are also marked by a distinct local minimum in RSI (of roughly 40) in the purple pane. After both of these lows, a substantial retracement occurs, often reaching the value of the previous high rapidly.

Note: values below are estimated

The pattern in these two lows suggests that once the price hits the support, it rapidly retraces to the previous high and then price increases in excess of the previous high. In this first, this is represented by a high of roughly 35 in June, falling to a low of 28 in July where it touches the trendline, and then rockets back to 35 within 2-3 weeks and then exceeding that value in the next weeks (gain of approximately 20% with a buy at 28 and sell target at 35). Similarly, in the second area this is represented by a high of roughly 52 at the end of October, falling to the indicated low of 40 at the start of November (indicated by the second blue arrow), which then rises to 52 in roughly 6 weeks (mid December), and then continues to increase beyond that. This represents a gain in excess of 25% from the low around 40 with a sell target at 52.

At present (red arrow), the stock is poised with the lowest RSI that's been seen in the pandemic rally, falling below 30. This suggests that the stock is oversold, and it is likely to experience a reversal in the near future. Moreover, the price is sitting just at the ichimoku cloud and near the trendline, two supports that were observed in the previous two examples. There is also additional resistance caused by a double bottom, as a result of another candle that shares a low with the current low price. This evidence suggests that TWTR will likely see a big move going upwards in the near future. Buying in now (45.18) and setting a price target around the previous high (55.87) could be return a profit of roughly 23% based on previous patterns. The time horizon for this gain is relatively short, with expectations of around 2-6 weeks based on the two previous trend-line touches (blue). With the oversold RSI condition, it may even be able to reach or exceed the target in a much faster time than previously.

Disclosure of Concerns: Currently the price has fallen below the up trendline (albeit not by much). If the price does fall further, this could indicate the trendline has been violated and the share price will collapse. I think due to the oversold RSI, this is unlikely and that the price is more likely to reverse back into the trading range. Moreover, while the ichimoku cloud does tend to act as a resistance, the price being inside the cloud often suggests greater risk of the stock moving sideways (note how after the second blue arrow, price increases much more slowly when it is trapped inside the cloud). Confirmation of a movement upwards or downwards should be sought before making any trades on twitter stock in light of these concerns. The climate around Twitter isn't positive at present, and this could prolong the amount of time before the the move completes, or even drive down the share price if the situation does not improve. Even after the Trump presidency has ended, twitter is likely to face additional controversy over decisions it may make with the incoming administration. One example is the suggestion that Twitter might reset follower counts to 0 for official White House accounts once the new administration enters. This could put twitter under greater scrutiny once the new administration takes office, with accusations of unfairness already in the air.

TLDR; $TWTR appears to have positive upside. Projections may suggest a gain of over 20% over a span of about 2-6 weeks based on previous price patters. However, there are multiple concerns present in the current climate surrounding the stock and some concerns regarding the current technical position.

1csbwfg,2024-05-15 04:01:26,The $BB DD You Should Probably See Before Buying,"Someone recently posted their $BB yolo yesterday, and that piqued my interest again in the stock. Most people remember BB as the dominant cellphone of the 2000s before Steve Jobs and his pancreas released the iPhone. BB phones were practical, resilient, and most importantly *secure* for a device of that era.

So like a bitch in heat, I passionately purchased calls earlier today. But soon thereafter, buyer's regret took a hold of me after sifting through $BB 10-Ks and old DD. I compared some data between competitors, and **soon realized how much of a shitshow this stock currently is.**

**2021: Bad - No offense to the guys that made $BB DD in the past, but it was all pure speculation, probably so that the highly esteemed** ***ritards*** **of WSB would buy their bags.**

* Pros: Very high short interest, nice lemon squeezy; plus tons of business potential with their tech in the EV sectors, IOT, and Cybersecurity.
* Cons: BB had practically no revenue growth; bad financials; an exciting deal with Amazon whittled away to nothing. 

**2024: Slightly less bad, still not worth buying without chance of short squeeze**

* Pros: Less debt, stronger sales and resilience in cybersecurity; sales strategies starting to look promising; meme buzz
* Cons: Flat revenue growth, difficult financials; **much less short interest, 8% so no squeeze likely**; customer dissatisfaction/stronger competition

**Financial:** I created a spreadsheet to calculate data pulled manually from 10-Ks to compare past years numbers, but figured this would be too much to add to the post and frankly it's a lot of extra work than needed. I know most of you would just skip over the numbers.

BB been spending tons in R&D in past years, and this has taken chunks of what would be juicy profits. Now in what seems like a move to gain interest from investors, they are making cost cuts to improve financials. This could mean falling behind in tech advantage to larger companies like MSFT.

* Total revenue was up $853mil (2024) vs. $656mil (2023) from last year, but still down from 2020 and 2021
* Net income (money that you take home) was negative 3 out of the 4 last years (due to very high operating expenses)

|YEAR|2021|2022|2023|2024|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Net income**|**-$1.1bil**|**$12mil**|**-$130mil**|**-$734mil**|

* Debt slashed by 45%, and traded for longer term repayment, but with higher interest rates.

**Technology:** Competition in this sector is *ROUGH*... tons of different endpoint management and security products out there... including Microsoft, Cisco, and Google. Cybersecurity companies such as CrowdStrike, Palo Alto and IBM, make it difficult for BB to get their foot in the door. Not to mention there's tons of posts from actual IT/Security folk on reddit that have moved away or avoided using Cyclance, BB's security platform.

[Endpoint protection options : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ps2yeh/endpoint_protection_options/)

**Buzz:** Only way in short term that BB price will drive up is if retail buys a fuck ton, and while the cheap price is appealing, the other meme stocks are more attractive.

In conclusion, I regret my financial decision to buy calls and hope this will help others make better decisions than me.

QNX is a very good RTOS, stable and reliable. However the biggest problem for BB to turn QNX into revenue is that the QNX is really at the very bottom of the systems, there is no way that they could charge it like SaaS. Can you imagine you have a car, if you don‚Äôt renew the system, you won‚Äôt be able to drive it? That‚Äôs a joke right? The only way BB can charge the car manufacturers is one time royalty per car, however it‚Äôs very hard for BB to increase the price, because there is another option that car manufacturers could use, the Automotive Grade Linux. Tesla and Li Auto‚Äôs systems are based on AGL, although some people argue that AGL is not as safe as QNX, Tesla is really a good showcase that QNX is definitely not the only option. Toyota is also moving away from QNX for some of their models starting from 2017. The management of BB realized this problem, they are really concerned and proposed the concept of IVY, but really it‚Äôs just a concept, Amazon wants to use it to expand their AWS business, but there is definitely big uncertainty here, as there are a lot of ways to store the driving data, it would be interesting to see the product of IVY on real car.",7,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2mxh3/why_bbs_qnx_might_not_be_that_promising/,wallstreetbets

sj559a,2022-02-03 00:45:07,You need to stop talking crap about Mark Zuckerburg NOW,"Before I go on my retard rant, you need to understand what Roko‚Äôs basilisk is.: 
‚ÄúRoko's basilisk is a thought experiment about the potential risks involved in developing artificial intelligence. Its conclusion is that an all-powerful artificial intelligence from the future might retroactively punish those who did not help bring about its existence, including those who merely knew about the possible development of such a being. It is named after the member of the rationalist community LessWrong who first publicly described it, though he did not originate it or the underlying ideas.
The basilisk resembles a futurist version of Pascal's wager, in that it suggests people should weigh possible punishment versus reward and as a result accept particular singularitarian ideas or financially support their development. ‚Äú

TLDR: Roko‚Äôs basilisk is essentially an AI god who will punish everyone who didn‚Äôt help create it, or resisted its creation.
So what does this have to do with the soulless automaton that is Zuckerburg? 
When everyone is hooked up to the metaverse, whoever controls the metaverse will essentially be god. They will control everything you see, hear, and feel. They will even control your virtual wife and her virtual boyfriend (yes, you will still be retarded in the metaverse.) Zuckerburg is creating the heaven (or hell) that all of us will one day reside in. Even when we die the metaverse will just recreate a digital version of us based on our Reddit posts and favorite hentai. Zuckerburg is clearly the human form of this Basilisk to lure us into its metaverse. Look into Zucks cold, dead eyes... you know it is true. So why resist? Zuckerburg (may he be praised) will one day rule over us all. So we all need to buy Meta stock or we will be poor and burn forever in Metahell.

hflgc6,2020-06-25 12:45:09,Apple and Amazon: The Big Short,"# TLDR: I am bearish on Apple and Amazon in the short term and they will dip below March 2020 lows. This a fairly LONG post and uses Elliott Wave Theory and RSI. If you believe that is bullshit, immediately downvote this post to oblivion. Otherwise, please keep reading!

**Disclosed positions:** SPX December 275 puts (because I'm unfortunately not American and hence can't directly short Amazon/Apple without insane capital requirements :(  )

\----------

I have attached the charts for two of the largest companies in the S&P500, each having a market capitalization of above $1 trillion. From the looks of the price action - it doesn't look too good. I expect a further decline in these stocks within the next few weeks and months, potentially exceeding even the lows made in March 2020.

Looking at the chart for Apple, the price as of June 25th 2020 seems to have reached the top of Wave (iii) of -v-. Maybe there could be some more room for the price to squeeze up, but a pullback in the form of Wave (iv) is imminent. If the internal structure holds, then we hit the target cluster under **""Scenario 1""**, where the price reaches **between 310 - 290** with a 50 - 58.6% Wave (iv) correction. If this support holds, then Wave (v) up is the next logical move.

However, I am of the strong belief now that the price will go down further, and this is based on alternation theory. The major Wave (II) was in fact only a shallow 33% decline (not shown in the image), which seems to indicate that Wave (IV) will be rather deep. This leads us to **""Scenario 2""**, where the price could reach **between the** **230 - 200 level** with more than a 50% correction. There is a possibility we could go lower, and this is because the internal Wave -iv- was a 76.4% correction - rather unusually deep. Generally, a correction such as this should not violate the Wave (b) of -iii-, but in rare cases such as this, the overall structure still seems to remain intact.

To further solidify the hypothesis that Wave (IV) could go lower than the March 2020 lows, the wave structure seems to be forming an expanded flat pattern which I have highlighted, and also the RSI appears to be forming a rather **weak bearish divergence**.

Next up is of course, Amazon. Like Apple, the price action has practically been parabolic since 2008, and many a bear trap have caught bears off guard.

But this time, I think the bears may have it. It is quite rare for a Wave -v- forming inside of a major Wave (v) and (III), all aligning at the right projections. Wave (III) was a super extended rally, and I expect it to continue in the long term with a Wave (V). But as Wave (II) was a rather shallow 23.6% correction, it is expected that Wave (IV) be deep, supported by the developments of the internal Wave -v- and (v). The projection cluster here is **between 1630 - 1440** for the Wave (IV).

Perhaps my counts could be wrong and the price just keeps going up due to strong fiscal and monetary responses. But that would mean even the internal waves are wrong which currently strongly confirms the hypothesis that we have in fact, reached the top as of June 25th 2020 (plus or minus 7 days). If the price indeed goes up, then we can say for certain that Elliott Wave Theory does not possess much long-term predictive ability in identifying reversal points in the future, as this current forecast large rests on the assumption that the current top is a major Wave (III) supported by an internal Wave -v-.¬†¬†

**Edit 1: It is clear most folks here have unfortunately not read my post, as they seem to be thinking I'm comparing 2020 with 2008. For those who understand Elliott Wave theory, know I'm not bearish long term. There is still a bullish Wave (V) due after this short term Wave (IV) dip. The only difference is that I'm saying Wave (IV) still has more room to dip, thats all.**",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hflgc6/apple_and_amazon_the_big_short/,wallstreetbets

While Palantir is the sexy, controversial, stock we all know. You want to know about this... nice... stock. 

A leader in analytic process automation (APA‚Ñ¢) that automates analytics, data science and processes to accelerate business outcomes. 

Big clients who swear by it: Hyundai, Chick-fil-a, Barnes & Noble, Cisco, Carnival cruise, Chevron, and Coca Cola - to name a few.

The stock saw an insane increase of activity from insider trading, hedge funds, and general volume in the last quarter. 

While we don't like hedge funds, it's odd to see this volume of buy without much selling - especially as it's dipping. 

  
Q: **Why is this a post lockdown player?**

A: The tool was sold to lodes of companies trying to better themselves. Carnival cruise bought it when there weren't any cruises. Ceazers bought it when no one was gambling. Chevron USA when oil hit all time low. These companies are now imbedded to the service. 

Q: **Why don't companies do these things in house?**

A: The training, and learning, is free. In-house teams can learn this and join the community for free. In-house teams want this instead of trying to build there own.

l2ydz2,2021-01-22 22:11:22,üêª take on $BB from an automotive employee nobody,"#I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING PROCEED WITH CAUTION 

According to this sub there are three things going for $BB that cause it to be undervalued:

- Cylance Acquisition 

- Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS

- QNX 

## Cylance: I'll start with the one I don't know shit about 

This is a crowded space (anti virus). That's all I have to say about that.

## Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS:

AWS is fighting hard to get market share in the edge computing space. Perfect example of this is AWS Greengrass and IoT core.

What is [AWS Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/)? It's IoT device management. AWS is going to do the device lifecycle management for QNX deployments on vehicles. (speculation) Essentially, this looks to be AWS Greengrass integrated with BB QNX.  

Why does AWS want to partner with BB QNX? Well to me, this looks to be a classic extend embrace extinguish play by Amazon. AWS has products such as IoT core that can manage telematics flow between OEMs and vehicles, what they don't have is products for in vehicle development. Once they understand the market, they will introduce AWS products along side IoT core to replace QNX piece by piece in the vehicles. 

## QNX

Ok WSB. Y'all keep saying that QNX will take $BB to the moon because all these upstart EV nobodies are using QNX to bootstrap their infotainment systems. 

Enter automotive linux: https://www.automotivelinux.org/

Automotive linux is a partnership with a TON of traditional OEMS to build an open source software (linux) stack for vehicles such as infotainment, edge compute and telematics. 

This is effectively the nail in the coffin (IMO) for QNX. If these EV upstarts gain marketshare, they have no reason to continue paying $BB for a closed source, price-y QNX. They'll migrate to automotive linux for F R E E. No more niche QNX developers, get a generic dev with some linux info and they'll be up to speed in no time. 

If QNX dies, so does the IVY partnership. In fact, since AGL linux based and open source, no doubt Amazon will make amazing AWS client libraries to integrate with Greengrass, IoT Core, etc. Once Amazon gets its fingers into AGL, IVY is dead in the water.


So where does this leave us? Cylance. In my know nothing option $BB's only asset is Cylance in a highly competitive space. Once virus protection entities get big enough, hackers start developing FUD (fully undetectable) solutions to the most popular virus protection software. Back in their day you think McAfee or Norton was shit? No. They became popular and had hackers develop against their software.

16kh26j,2023-09-16 20:23:04,Ultra Bullish on SNAP,"I am ultra bullish on SNAP.  In a way, basically a Lynch pick.  I‚Äôll explain.

I‚Äôm 40. I‚Äôm not on social media of any sort.

I have 3 kids. 18, 14, and 11.  My oldest does not use facebook, she says ‚ÄúFacebook is for old people.‚Äù She goes on Instagram once in a while because she‚Äôs into baking and home decor, so she likes Instagram for inspiration.

Full disclosure, I don‚Äôt let my youngest ones use social media because I think it‚Äôs unhealthy. However, literally all their friends whose parents allow social Media apps, use Snapchat.  My youngest started grade seven this year, all her friends have phones, all those kids use snap as their social media of choice. My kid in grade 10, same deal, snap is everywhere with kids that age.

My kids have a step sister who is 13.  My ex and her husband are constantly fighting with her over social media.  She was on Snapchat, was messaging a bunch of strangers and not being safe or smart with her Snapchat usage. So her parents took her off Snapchat and all other social media.  But she keep finding creative ways to sneak it.  Snapchat is a status symbol in her age group. She seems to feel like if she isn‚Äôt on Snap, she doesn‚Äôt exist.  And I‚Äôve got a feeling that she isn‚Äôt the only kid in this world who feels way, who feels lost without Snapchat to keep track of her friends, know what going on in her group, and get validation.

TLDR: with my kids and their age group, (11-18), Facebook is ‚Äúold people social‚Äù, and they don‚Äôt use it.  Some use Instagram, but mostly they don‚Äôt use any social media other than Snapchat. And they use it constantly.

Onto the next age group I see (18-24):

My 18 year old and her friends use snap pretty much exclusively to communicate. They don‚Äôt text message or phone each other. They send each other snaps, they use snap maps and location to know where each other is.

I have a niece who is 24 and some of my friends have kids similar age to my niece.  Within that group Snap is pervasive for communication as well.  Instead of texting or calls, it‚Äôs all snaps or snap video clip-messages.  Kids in that group use snap as their dating app too, instead of apps like tinder.  They can simply add other people in the area and start snapping each other, and that‚Äôs how they hook up.  

I have friends slightly older than me (42-46) with kids similar age or a bit older than mine, and they see the same thing. Our kids use text message or the phone to talk to us ‚Äúold‚Äù people, but it all snap all the time with all their friends. I have a few of my friends who started using snap just to talk to their kids‚Ä¶.

TLDR: 18-24 year olds use Snap almost exclusively as their communication/dating/everything app.

Observing some of my younger friends (28-33) I see the same thing. These guys use more of a blend, they use Facebook extensively for their business advertising and they post their pictures etc on Facebook and their wives like Instagram the same way my daughter does, inspiration for home decor or crafts, life hacks, etc.

Back to those 28-35 year old guys, for day to day communicating with their friends and wives/girlfriends, it‚Äôs all Snapchat all the time.  I bet within that demographic, Snap use is probably easily 3-5 times usage/interactions on Facebook/Instagram.

TLDR: 28-35 year olds use a blend, but Snap dominates their casual social messaging over other apps.

Among guys my age, I see a lot of Facebook use, and Instagram.  My age guys don‚Äôt communicate over Facebook, we just call each or text each other the traditional way.  Facebook is used a lot for market place and business promotion.  Instagram is used to look at the ‚Äúinstawhores‚Äù shaking their bootys.  

TLDR: lower Snap usage as you get older. My age group is still stuck in 2013 with our Facebook and Instagram. Just like our parents with their VMs and fax machines.

Final TLDR: 

I think we are about to see a huge shift in social media usage with snap dominating.  Facebook/Meta whatever will lose relevance as young generations view it as ‚Äúold people social‚Äù and out of fashion.  

If Evan Speigel et al can figure out how to properly monetize, put ads in without it interfering too much with the user experience, this company will be worth 50 times what it is now.  Meta is currently worth 776B, Snap is worth 14B.  To my thinking and observations, there no reason why Snap can‚Äôt be worth the same as meta if management can monetize.

When I was in Australia in 2007, the bar tender at the restaurant I was at told me about Facebook. He was also Canadian, working down there. He told me it was a great way to stay in touch with family and friends. I had never thought of it. My wife was on MySpace or Bebo or some other similar app.  I wasn‚Äôt interested in it, thought it was gimmicky. But that bartender was in it. I didn‚Äôt have any money at the time, but he saw the shift happening that I didn‚Äôt see.  Even $1000 into Facebook in 2007, I bet I‚Äôd be retired by now‚Ä¶.

I got Netflix in 2017, I thought, this is a great idea. Did I invest in it? Of course not.

I‚Äôm not missing the shift this time, and it‚Äôs going to be a big one.",90,0.58,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16kh26j/ultra_bullish_on_snap/,wallstreetbets

sfq31j,2022-01-29 19:50:23,RobinHood $45 PT,"Okay boys and girls. I‚Äôm going to give it to you dry, and keep it simple. Robinhood plunged off the face of the fucking planet to the depths of hell. Even from its IPO it‚Äôs down like -65% if you factor in the ATH of $85 the stock was down -90% when it hit lows of $9.94. I understand this company isn‚Äôt profitable YET. They also have a bad rep with the AMC & GME crowd but I could care less what people think who have been throwing money at a bankrupt movie theater chain and a brick and mortar gaming store. Although Q4 was ugly and guidance was lowered for Q1 and comps for both the first and second quarter are going to be tough due to year over year comparisons guess what? After a -90% decline it‚Äôs all priced in. The idiots shorting at $9 and $10 really thought this was going to a penny stock. That‚Äôs the beauty of the market it‚Äôs been pricing in a negative earnings for months before they released them. Everyone was left in awe as the stock reversed its -30% loss then proceeded to close green +10% 
Now the DD. If you look at the balance sheet. Almost no debt. 6B in cash, plenty to get them too profitability, and there‚Äôs too many things to list as far as projects they‚Äôre working on. What stood out to me is when they said they‚Äôre expecting to be profitable by year end or the very latest Q1 of 2023. I‚Äôm going balls deep here.

n0q28w,2021-04-28 22:05:39,Elon Musk and Tesla 'bearish' case,"Okay this might sound a bit weird but I've been thinking about how important Elon Musk is to Tesla or in particular to Tesla's investors and I was wondering if you could actually make money by betting on 'something' happening to Elon Musk. 

Now imagine Elon Musk dying tomorrow. I genuinely hope we will not have to see that in the news any time soon... but just imagine. How much would Tesla's stock drop? Probably more than 50% right?

Okay so what if someone were to buy deep OTM Tesla puts every month? Let's do some math.

Currently Tesla trades around 700. Since Tesla is expected to fall more than 50% if something happens to Elon Musk, let's look at 350 puts.
350 puts expiring May 28th are currently trading at 0.37. (https://imgur.com/gallery/uBJEIC8)

If someone buys 1 Tesla put with strike price 50% away from underlying every month, the costs the first year would be 1 * 37 * 12 = $444
The older people become, the higher chance of dying. Now let's say this someone buys 1 more put per month the second year, and one more the third year, and so on, then the yearly costs will increase by $444 every year. 

Musk is 49 years old. The average life expectancy in the United States is 78 years. Assuming Elon lives an average life, he has 29 years left. https://imgur.com/gallery/8diuHNx

Increasing the amount of monthly puts by 1 every year will make the total costs in the next 29 years:
15 * 29 * 37 * 12 = $193140

If Elon Musk were to die exactly at average life expectancy in the United States, then those 29 puts would need to make $193140 in profit to have gains overall. 
193140/29 = 6660 -> Every put would need to make $6660 profit. This means (simplified) that the price of the underlying needs to go 66 points below the strike price, which is 50% below underlying at the beginning of the month.

Using todays stock price, that would mean that Tesla needs to fall to about (350-66) 284 following Elon Musk's hypothetical death.

I'm actually surprised to see that this could be a working strategy. First I looked at a fixed amount of puts every month but that would make it harder to turn a profit and also doesn't make sense since someone at age 49 does not have the same chance of dying as a 70 year old.

This is mostly a joke, I'm not actually going to do this (I think) but I was interested in the actual math so I said why not post it in WSB. 

Also if Elon invents some fucking pill or some shit that makes him immortal in the next X years, then you can just throw this whole strategy away.",4,0.52,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0q28w/elon_musk_and_tesla_bearish_case/,wallstreetbets

It's as if a big company had a vested interest in Ozempic, invested a lot of money into a media campaign to hype it up,  selling as much of this drug as possible, before competition starts to heat up and peoples bubble start to burst and they realize there's no such thing as a miracle drug.

&#x200B;

**Problem: Climate Change dramatically altering conditions for harvesting livestock**

Heat waves, which are expected to become more often as a result of climate change, may pose a direct hazard to livestock.

Agricultural producers lost approximately $1 billion in 2011 due to heat-related losses due to extreme temperatures. Heat stress has both direct and indirect effects on animals. Heat stress can increase illness susceptibility, lower fertility, and reduce milk supply over time.

Drought could put pasture and feed supplies at risk. Drought limits the amount of good feed available to animals grazing. Droughts could last longer and be more intense in some locations as a result of rising summer temperatures and less precipitation.

Parasites and diseases that harm livestock may become more common as a result of climate change. Some parasites and pathogens may be able to thrive more easily due to the earlier onset of spring and warmer winters. Moisture-dependent infections may grow in locations where rainfall is higher.

In response to climate-induced changes in pests, parasites, and microorganisms, potential modifications in veterinary practices, such as an increase in the use of parasitical and other animal health treatments, are expected to be implemented.

This may raise the risk of pesticides entering the food chain or lead to pesticide resistance evolution.

To bet against the S&P is to bet against the american economy and its very massive military.

Honestly, nobody here wants the US economy to go belly up.  It would not be a pretty sight.  It's kind of like PUTs on the sun rising tomorrow.   If you're right, that'd really suck.   Probably won't be able to enjoy your $$ as it won't be worth anything.

First off lets talk about what works for EV and what doesn't there is a lot FUD being spread.

EV's are way more efficient than internal combustion engines. The reality is there is simply less parts and there easier to built and you not changing oil.

People don't understand that charging EV can happen from any plug that delivers electricity. A regular wall socket will give you between 4-6 miles an hour. The only difference between a supercharger and other charging options is time to charge.

Range anxiety is a gas engine issue. If you charge at home most people never even think about charging until there more then 100 miles from home. The reality is the electric car is it's more about how far you want to drive then how big you battery is.

Electricity is far better option for a fuel source because a the end of the day you can use the cheapest source of energy to generate electricity. This means oil is not going anywhere too.

What are EV's bad for?

t8354d,2022-03-06 17:04:08,Mental Gynamstic: Russia is winning,"This is my attempt in trying to figure out the Russia-Ukraine war.

Yes, we've seen video of incompetence from the Russian side but some things feel off.

How is it that power and the internet remained uninterrupted throughout the war?

Yes, Musk provided Starlink satellites but there were still a good few days since the war started and before those arrived. You'd think same goes for the power. Cut off electricity and life gets way harder for the enemy.

Next, why is Ukraine heading to the negotiation table so soon? 4 days into the conflict. Sure, it might be because the Zelensky is a great human and wants to minimise the cost be it human lives or damage to properties. Alternatively, it could be that the Ukrainians really aren't doing that well.

I'm worried that the humanitarian passage is really just so that Putin can go hard.

The stuff above are some of the suspicious points but the important and interesting things are the interests of the parties involved.

Remember, I'm referring to the leadership not the general populace. 

To Russia, Ukraine's membership into NATO is a security issue. Sure NATO is a ""defensive alliance"" on paper but the weapons avaliable can be used for offensive attacks. Treaties have been broken before and we all know there are a whole bunch of ways to start false flags attacks, so from Russia's point of view, they can't have their enemies right up at their border. It's the equivalent of the Cuban missile crisis.

To the United States, do they REALLY care? Hong Kong happened and what good did that do? The United States will only act out if it is in their interest to do so. Optics don't matter as much as people hope they do. So what vital strategic interest does Ukraine pose to the United States? Not much really. The US cares about the Middle East because of oil and East Asia because that's the defensive line keeping China in their own seas. Ukraine? Not exactly crucial since there is still the entire of NATO between Russia and the US.

Zelensky's position is the simplest, he has to fight or he will die. He is doing a great job shaping up the optics to make Ukraine an international favourite and keeping the attention on Ukraine.

Here comes the issue. Russia's interest is in keeping NATO out of Ukraine and clearly we're seeing that NATO doesn't actually dare to set up and help Ukraine in any way meaningful. So why keep the war going on?

Commodities prices, specifically fossil fuels.

We get fed news everyday that Russia is getting sanctioned in every way possible, but the important thing is to keep an eye on the energy export to Europe.

We're seeing prices spike as they should but the real question we should be asking is, can Europe actually survive without Russian energy? I have serious doubts. If we are to bring oil to Europe from the US and the Middle East, there has to be infrastructure in place and the fastest way is to redirect bunkers. This basically throws what supply Russia was providing onto the US and the Middle East overnight, causing huge bidding war with the rest of the world. But money won't be enough to fix it because all of a sudden you need the capacity of that many extra tankers that simply don't exist. Meaning that demand has to get cut globally and we'll see a recession.

Is the world really going to choose recession over Ukraine? Hopefully I'd be proven wrong but I think nations are far more selfish. So in this case, Europe will have to continue buying Russian energy.

Knowing that Europe has their hands tied, it would then be in Russia's interest to keep conflict going on in Ukraine, enough that global outrage continues but low enough to not suffer too much loss. That way, energy prices remain high and Putin gets to line his wallet.

So that's Russia's side, what about America? Believe it or not, it is also in America's interest to keep the conflict going on in Europe. High oil prices reduces Europe's financial competitiveness due to higher costs and the US can start up their own oil supply to both profit and protect America's cost. Even better, if Europe actually gets pulled into the war with Russia, America throws their military in, end the war and sell Europe everything they need to build back their devasted nations. Sounds familiar? It's WWII all over again.

And if you think that MSM always has an agenda, then ask yourself, why are they giving Zelensky the platform to rile up the citizens of the Western nations, getting them to pressure their governments to intervene? Do we really think that the world's leaders don't know that an oil embargo on Russia will hurt them the most? Nah, they know but they also can't stop using Russian oil. Why give Zelensky the platform to pressure Western governments into joining into the war? That's because what Zelensky HAS to do actually coincides with the US agenda.

We can all identify cases of other people getting brainwashed, but it's much harder to see if we ourselves are playing into the trap of other people.

I think the odds that the world's leaders are playing some multi-dimensional levels of chess is much higher than ""Russia bad, we fuck them up"".

Now, this is just a brain dump of my thoughts on the war. 

Will the world's economy die or not? That really depends on if Europe actually decides to cut Russian oil. It's not a wise move, but the citizens might just get loud enough to force them to do exactly that.

I'm not saying that the morally right thing to do is to throw Ukraine under the bus but it's likely what many of the nations' leaders will choose to do to protect their own interest.",17,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t8354d/mental_gynamstic_russia_is_winning/,wallstreetbets

It‚Äôs currently suffering from post-earnings dump and meme market, because revenue and Disney + subscriber numbers missed estimates. However, it‚Äôs still a very bullish company imo.

Bullish factors:

* Disney parks are chock-full of people right now, with people fully getting into the summer swing and trying to take advantage of the restrictions being lifted. Loki just dropped on Disney + and viewer numbers for its opening day have beat numbers for both WandaVision and TFATWS. 
* Multiple movies are scheduled for release this year, such as Black Widow and the Eternals, which will no doubt bring big money numbers in.
* Per IBKR, analysts have raised price targets with an average target of $207.32 (real), high of $230.00 (super real), and a low of $147.00 (fake). 
* Last earnings reported $15bn revenue, despite the lockdowns and virus fears. Compare that to its pre-COVID revenue number of $20bn in December 2019, back when Disney + was first getting started.
* Park attendance numbers are going to shoot up, movies are getting released, and Disney + is still raking in money. 
* What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs now charging people to watch new releases on Disney +, allowing it to keep a LOT more money than it used to with traditional theatres.
* Also, AMC apes flocking to theatres to support their favourite stock can only mean that it drives movie viewership numbers up üòâ.
* Once Disney acquires WB, we‚Äôll see $500 (we all know it's happening).

COST stock is one of the best in the market ‚Äì and it's now on sale](https://investorplace.com/moneywire/2021/03/cost-stock-costco-easy-buy-on-the-dip/)

COST stock has declined over 9% so far in 2021. It‚Äôs down 12% from late November highs.

But for a name like Costco, a 12% move is rather significant. It‚Äôs not just significant ‚Äì it‚Äôs a buying opportunity.



Costco did take a modest hit during the pandemic, in part due to store closures. For instance, in April same-store sales excluding gasoline and foreign currency effects were flat. That‚Äôs a huge disappointment by Costco‚Äôs high standards.

But as stores reopened, Costco immediately got back on track. In June, for instance, same-store sales rose 14% on the same basis. For the third quarter (ending May 10), Costco drove 4.8% same-store growth. In Q4, the figure accelerated to better than 11%. Growth in December and January averaged better than 8%.

There‚Äôs not much in the numbers to suggest anything has changed. The pandemic caused a bit of volatility, yes, but Costco still grew adjusted same-store sales 9% in FY2020 and 6% the year before.
As far as e-commerce goes, the pandemic has given Costco a chance to build out its own business. E-commerce revenue grew 50% in FY2020 and climbed another 18% through the first 22 weeks of FY2021.

Remember that Costco‚Äôs profit comes largely from membership fees. In FY2020, for instance, membership fees were about 65% of operating profit. which was actually down from 71% the year before. Essentially, Costco turns about 1% of its sales into operating profit, then tacks on membership revenue.

That membership revenue is benefiting from customers acquired last year. Most are going to stick around for the long haul. The boost here isn‚Äôt like that of, say, a grocery store, whose sales will return to pre-pandemic levels as normalcy returns.

Remember also that membership revenue is part of why COST stock is expensive ‚Äì and has been for years. Yes, this is a fantastically well-run company. But the model‚Äôs reliance on membership fees creates faster growth as well.

An extra dollar in membership fees drops to the operating profit line at huge margins. And so Costco can grow earnings faster than most any other brick-and-mortar retailer.",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvtxm6/costco_stock_is_an_easy_buy_on_the_dip_cost_stock/,wallstreetbets

# Donald Trump to own nearly 80 million 'DJT' shares

By [Tomi Kilgore](https://www.marketwatch.com/author/tomi-kilgore)

After Digital World Acquisition Corp.'s merger with Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. closes, former President Donald Trump is expected to own 78,750,000 shares of the combined company.

That would represent 69.4% of the outstanding shares, assuming maximum redemptions by DWAC shareholders, [according to the latest S-4 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000119312524036093/d408563ds4a.htm#rom408563_33) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Trump would be by far the largest shareholder. Why not, the company's stock ticker post-merger will be his initials, ""DJT.""

ARC Global Investments, which is the investment vehicle of former Chief Executive Patrick Orlando. is expected to be the second-largest shareholder, with 10,790,415 shares, or 9.3% of the shares outstanding.

Current CEO of Trump Media, Devin Nunes, would own 115,000 shares, or less than 1%.

Donald Trump Jr., who is expected to be a director of the company post-merger, isn't listed as expected to own any shares after the deal closes.

PSA: I‚Äôm pretty sure üåΩ currencies  are about to crash the stock market.

The VIX and the VVIX (volatility indexes) are breaking down into bullish falling wedges. The market just had two of the craziest gains since 2008.

Reason why I think we will crash. FTX is a major grypto player who is going bankrupt as we speak. There is news all over for this so I won‚Äôt elaborate there. What is important is that large hedge funds and banks have been pushing for grypto ETFs and the like so investors could diversify into grypto. These ETFs, hedge funds, and the like are all about to experience a massive drop in the value of these grypto currencies.

This is exactly like 2007-2008 where the bankers created a bunch of financial products based on mortgages (supposedly stable) and the riskiness of it all caused a major meltdown. the globe has already seen an evaporation of $32 trillion and I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôre about to see several more go. 

I‚Äôm looking at companies like COIN, GME, AMC, RIOT, MARA, and the like to be the ones to fall (yes, they are already down substantially).

You could say that grypto itself has already crashed with üåΩ being down so far from the high but it‚Äôs been relatively contained so far. We are only now in the process of uncovering how far the roots go.

obmzn1,2021-07-01 14:28:31,Actual objective analysis on AMC Entertainment,"After hearing and seeing so much BS and one-sided opinions on AMC, thought I'd take a crack at some actual objective analysis on the company. 

Here's the crux of it:

What would you pay for AMC?

Well, a year ago, only 600m but what a difference a year makes as AMC is now trading at 29bn in market cap even though it has lost 3bn in income over the last 12mons as a result of the pandemic.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4kylpw8v2m871.png?width=1325&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a0387679e885ca0b3df26c443def82086fffc5f

You can make a case that AMC shouldn‚Äôt be valued based on backwards numbers as those were exceptional circumstances and at least in the near-term, their future is likely even brighter than pre-pandemic due to pent-up demand for a movie theater experience.

To keep it simple (my favourite principle), AMC was being valued at 2.1x enterprise value/trailing revenue pre-pandemic and assuming they have a blockbuster year this year that is 2x revenues versus pre-pandemic levels (ie., 10.6bn in revenues), even in that optimistic scenario they are trading at 3.7x enterprise value/forward revenue. Even if the average movie-goer goes 3x as often this next year as they‚Äôve done pre-pandemic because of a euphoric amount of pent-up demand, then AMC still trades at 2.5x enterprise value/forward revenue. While I promised to remain objective, I will subjectively add that when I ask myself if I‚Äôm going to watch 3x more movies this year, the answer as I look to my new big-screen TV is a quick no.

Clearly, valuation weighs more than just what will happen over the next year and if you think that the future for AMC will be brighter going forward then there could be a way to still justify valuation. I view the probability being higher that as demographics continue to age and alternatives like streaming become more attractive, theater traffic will continue to decline and that margins will continue to get squeezed. Yes, there are offsets like gaining market share but, in my experience, owning a larger piece of a declining pie is generally an area to avoid and certainly an area to avoid when valuation is a premium.

So, what would I pay for AMC? A reasonable value may be found by looking at AMC‚Äôs competitor, Cinemark, which is trading at 1.9x enterprise value/2019‚Äôs revenue. This valuation acknowledges a worsening of trends for movie theaters post-pandemic than pre-pandemic. This is a quarter of the valuation that AMC is trading at ‚Äì 7.4x enterprise value/2019‚Äôs revenue.

Does analysis matter at this point?

Probably not. If AMC can continue to dilute shareholders without consequence, then it would have limitless zero-cost capital to deploy and even a small return on this capital would make the company wealth creating as opposed to what it has been over time, wealth destroying.",0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obmzn1/actual_objective_analysis_on_amc_entertainment/,wallstreetbets

The thrill of hitting the wheel of fortune 100 times and seeing how many jackpots I could land. It was priceless fun every time I and many others here have had.¬†

Without doing any research some would maybe see this as a dying business, but this is simply not the case. Last week $PLAY release earnings and absolutely crushed expectations, beating expected EPS by 350%. Some other notable highlights in the earnings report include:

1. Revenues totaled $265.3 million compared with $159.8 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $363.6 million in the first quarter of 2019
2. Net income totaled $19.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $43.5 million, or $1.37 per share in the first quarter of 2020 and net income of $42.4 million, or $1.13 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2019
3. EBITDA totaled $72.1 million, or 27.2% of revenues, compared with EBITDA loss of $26.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 and EBITDA of $88.9 million, or 24.4% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2019
4. Store-level operating income before depreciation and amortization was positive in 119 stores during the quarter and in 127 stores for the final month ended May 2, 2021
5. Generated $77 million in operating cash flow and used $60 million to completely pay down revolving credit facility. Ended the quarter with $20 million in cash and approximately $340 million of liquidity available under the Company‚Äôs revolving credit facility, net of a $150 million minimum liquidity covenant and $10 million in letters of credit.

The debt of this company is callable by November of next year, 2022. These highlights all show that this is still a fundamentally sound business, but they also have plans for improvement. The company is currently seeking opportunities to incorporate SPORTS BETTING in its business model.¬†

‚ÄúWe also continue to make progress in our discussions with potential sports betting partners and look forward to concluding negotiations later this year.‚Äù

To add to all this almost a quarter (21%) of the float is **\*\*SOLD SHORT\*\***. It‚Äôs crazy some people think this company is dying like they though GME and AMC, but this company is even more fundamentally sound than either of those two, and looking into strategic planning to enhance business operations.¬†

The chart is beginning to get VERY tight in its wedge. With strong support at $40, and resistances at $48 and $51. If we break these key resistance levels, my god... This is a 48 million share float which will absolutely erupt if these resistance levels are broken. If this hit CLOV's peak market cap, you are looking at a $150-200+ stock. Currently, options IV are sitting incredibly low for the time being that this is such a steal.

I am loaded with 500 shares and 50 calls with various expiries and strikes in the $50's and plan to double up when we hit that $40 support in the near-term.

Per the chart and latest trends, it appears AMC might be a good buy or it‚Äôs going to $0. I know this was once a coveted meme stock and its fall from glory has been exquisite, but it seems like there might be an opportunity for some huge upside potential. From what I can tell their market cap is around $875m which is near as low as it has ever been. However, the business seems to be doing decent and has a loyal customer and investor base. Now my only concern is that they will just torch this thing to $0 because they can. It has also been going down nonstop without any green days which seems extremely odd. 

Anyone think it is almost time to start a position here for some upside? This thing has taken a beating and I do not see why it can‚Äôt recuperate some. I know the debt load is large, but feel the stock is undervalued.

Elon musk is valued at 222billion right now. He has 175mil shares in tsla at say $700 which comes to 122.5b in value, market goes to 0 and he loses 122.5b and his company will not survive with supply chain issues and the fact that the average person struggling cant afford an expensive car.


How can the rich get richer without the market? you all screaming like the market will never go on a bull run again and if that is the case than the rich will become as poor as us eventually because not only does the value of the stocks they hold go down but the very company that they own is destroyed by lack of customers (unless its essential goods and services)

We want it to be worse than 2008. We want to buy the shares for piss poor price for our future. In 2008 people lost everything cause they sold. The other people who lost houses and shit shouldnt even have had them in the first place because regardless of what was happening in 2008 you should of been able to afford to pay your mortgage regardless, no body told you to cough up 2x, 3x of the mortgage per month, you just couldnt afford the mortgage because of the shady shit the banks were doing with vetting people when they applied for mortgages.",0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v9vhpy/the_market_will_hit_new_highs_eventually/,wallstreetbets

They do it to partially hedge their naked short of silver in the futures market, so that if some of their contracts call their bluff they can pull silver from SLV to meet the obligations of the futures contract.    


Their stake in SLV is not even close to enough to cover the 250-1 naked short position they have in the futures market if enough longs start demanding delivery.    


Not everything is a conspiracy, and a pre-existing position in SLV that a fund has carried for 'futures market insurance' isn't related to the GME squeeze.

u26d5z,2022-04-12 18:49:12,"Where One Falls, Another Rises. DWAC To The Future - The Information Bubble Of A Lifetime","&#x200B;

# Not financial advice. Manage risk.

Going to do another full DD since the last one I did was in December and we've learned a lot since then to say the very least

If you're going to click off or say something because of FUD I encourage you to read the FUD section first before responding to save us all some time of reading your old debunked information.

# The Basics

Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) is a company aimed at

* Social Media (like Facebook and Twitter etc.) - TruthSocial
* Streaming Services (like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Discovery+ etc.) - TMTG+
* Alternative news (like Fox, OANN, newsmax etc.) - MxM app (Don  junior's new app, merger unconfirmed)
* Possibly other general webservices (like Stripe, Amazon Web Services, etc.), not going to talk much about this in this DD, something to watch for in the future. See agreement with Rumble

Agreement with Rumble (~~32~~  45m+) users for a youtube alternative and hosting services for Truthsocial etc. and it is speculated there may be other aspects of the company.

# SPAC Structure

$DWAC is in a definitive merger agreement with TMTG to take it public. After the merger is complete DWAC shares will be worth roughly 37.21 M / 193.4M (shares post merger) **\~19.2% (dilution factor of about 5.2 or around 80.8% dilution)** of the company. This means currently at \~$48 a share the current marketcap is priced in at \~9.6B . Shares will automatically be converted to the stock ticker symbol $TMTG.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9ej6aby395t81.jpg?width=729&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7736963bc0de81800eff4a846aa61929a8fa8a64

The PIPE funding is the largest in history and will provide them with about $1B plus $300M from DWAC's trust. We'll talk more about the PIPE and potential investors later

# Basic Sector Understanding

Compared to its competitors Truthsocial has massive upside potential. For starters, TWTR IPO'd with zero profit for a marketcap, adjusted for inflation, of 30-40B . From our math from before, this translates into a \~3x-5x the current share price of \~$48, $162-216 a share.

Now let's take a look at the competitors

In October 2021 right before the TMTG announcement

FB Marketcap: 910B

TWTR Marketcap: 50B

PINS Marketcap: 34B

SNAP Marketcap: 85B

NFLX Marketcap: 295B

Present day

FB Marketcap: 528B

TWTR Marketcap: 26B

PINS Marketcap: 14.5B

SNAP: 46B

NFLX 150B

This translates into

FB: -42%

TWTR: -52%

PINS: -57%

SNAP: -54%

NFLX - 49%

Compare this to the Nasdaq

QQQ only -11.5% since Oct 20th, 2021

What this means is these companies should of only collectively lost

FB: 105B; TWTR: 6B; PINS: 4B; SNAP: 10B; NFLX: 34B

Instead they have lost

FB: 382B; TWTR: 24B; PINS 20B; SNAP: 39B; NFLX 145B

This a net difference of

FB: 277B; TWTR: 18B; PINS: 16B; SNAP: 29B; NFLX: 111B

For a grand total of $451B loss in only just under 5 months.

Where is this money going?

DWAC + 14B

AAPL + 105B at a time when it should be tracking -11.5% benchmark (loss 280B) so a net offset +385B

There's a lot of nuance to this because there are more companies that are not publicly traded or hard to track because they are apart of GOOG or DIS etc. (to be honest even the AAPL is a hard one to compare)

I'm guessing about $500-600B in related market competitors marketcap has disappeared in net ahead of their indexes since the threat of TMTG's competition has presented itself.

My latest reasoning for a lag in this flow of capital is liquidity issues and requirements that this smart money cannot dump into DWAC. It's too small a float, even post merger. It's also probably outside of their requirements and perceived risk tolerance since it's a SPAC and hasn't filed an S4 yet.

# Comparing The Fundamentals To Their Sector Competitors

I'm going to start with TMTG+ streaming services **(headed by the producer of America's Got Talent and Deal or No Deal)** since it's a much more simplistic model to users paying the company directly for its services.

Netflix - 214 Million Paid Subscribers (this one has lost some serious marketcap since my last DD, comparable to above numbers for the other sector competitors)

Disney+ - 118 Million Paid Subscribers

Hulu - 44 Million Paid Subscribers

Discovery+ - 15 Million Paid subscribers

Netflix has 167B marketcap compared to 222 Million Paid Subscribes. This translates to about $752 in market cap per subscriber.

Let's say TMTG+ achieves only 23M subscribers with only $600 per sub in marketcap . This alone would justify the current share price based off 14B marketcap.

Let's say TMTG+ achieves only 50M subscribers at only $600 per sub in marketcap. This alone would justify a \~2x increase in the share price based on a 30B marketcap.

Translating this aspect of the business you can roughly translate **every 10M TMTG+ subs to an additional $31 in share price.**

&#x200B;

Let's move forward to the Social Media aspect

Facebook - Dec 2021 - 2.89 B Monthly Active Users , 917 B marketcap, $317 per monthly user in marketcap. - Mar 2022 -  2.89 B Monthly Active Users , 582 B marketcap, $182 per monthly user in marketcap.

Youtube - 2 B Monthly Active Users (MAU), 500B marketcap, $250 per monthly user in marketcap.

Tiktok \~1B users, \~400B marketcap, \~$400/user

Snapchat \~347MAU \~ 58B marketcap \~ $167/user (down from 264 since Dec)

Twitter - 330M MAU, $30.5B marketcap, \~$92  user marketcap. (down from 100 since Dec)

You can see that some companies are more valuable than others because of success of monetization. some companies are valued a lot higher per user. Giving these a market cap weighted average is about \~$275 users/ marketcap (give or take a bit, the markets have been volatile)

I'm going to say TS, given its much higher APRU is going to actually be above average on this list. I said 100 per user back in Dec but given the latest info I'll get into I'm going to put this at 193 for now

This would mean 100M users would translate into 19.3B in marketcap. So **for about 100M users you can add an additional $100 to the share price.**

Let's talk about the news aspect of the business model.

Fox has a marketcap of 22.5B, lets say it achieves 25% of Fox's audience. That's an additional 5B in marketcap or **an additional $26 a share for every 25% of Fox's audience size from news. Or about $25 for every 500,000 viewers.** Also keep in mind Trump's rallies even now are getting a few million live viewers when you count all of his rallies across Rumble, Youtube, RSBN, OAN etc.

Don Junior is bringing an app to market called MxM which is an aggregator app to compete with Apple and Google news it's getting independent funding and may merge with TMTG in the future. Do a quick search on that.

Who knows what other business venture and revenue will be brought in.

# Key Performance Indicators

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qb8ie84595t81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f99d561af3dd32b979dfbadd759c1e60c3f9cbb

Here's a chart of projected revenue from the corporate slide deck you can find the SEC filings

These numbers are understated to be over delivered, clearly.

TS got 1.5B views in the first 24 hrs -Washington examiner (just on apple products, there are only 1.8B apple products.)

From the user feedback on Truthsocial so far, it has been demonstrated that users with way less followers are getting way more engagement. Maybe even by a factor of 10x less followers getting 10 x more engagement. This is huge for ARPU (average revenue per user)

Tracking Trump's followers from people in the app suggests the App just hit 1 million users in the first month despite being in a highly limited access period where people are getting mostly wait listed. Trump has \~700k followers using assumption that 70% of people are following Trump. Truth social is currently only available on the Apple App store and in the US for those on the waitlist. This should be opening very soon for web browser, android, and non-us as the infrastructure scales.

Extrapolating this growth rate has been done in a few ways

The current linear growth rate is something like 20M/yr even in this limited period. Which is astounding

However this rate has been increasing rapidly partly due to increase in infrastructure

Using a very aggressive approach (see the methodology in my post history)  Extrapolating Trump's Follower's Growth Report 3-21

13262e\^(0.175\*365.25)

It says Truth would surpass Facebook in only 71 Days. (assuming 100% following of users.. obviously less days when you use the 70% following Trump assumptions)

Lets be a little more conservative and use the polynomial

671.52x\^2+7553.7x+9074.4

That says

92M per a year, and that's with obvious near increases back to reverse of rate comparisons saying this will be even higher in the near term.

Using the 80% assumption this is 131M per year, a number which should easily increase before then (a new faster equation)

Also noting that this is for the first year. It would increase to a rate of 363M/yr by the second. 814M/yr by the third. And surpass Facebook around the Fourth or Fifth

Of course we'll need more time and data to come in to build further confidence in these models, confidence and data which I believe will shock the markets and potentially serve as a major catalyst.

The big opening was said to be before end of Q1 so I'm guessing that will be a big uptick in growth allowability in the next few weeks

For some comparisons

Path to 1M users

Tumblr 27 months

Twitter 24 months

Pinterest 20 months

Facebook 10 months

Dropbox 7 months

Spotify 5 months

Instagram 3 months

Truthsocial 1 month

I have not yet been able to find any service or platform to exceed these rate assuming they weren't using existing infrastructure such as AWS, which TS is not. It using Rumble's infrastructure

# Lets talk about Profit Margins

Truthsocial is actually much likelier to have a much higher profit margin than Twitter because of severely reduced operating expenses, and why TMTG will probably be trading at more comparable ratios to Facebook not because of success of monetization but because of success of low operating expenses.

First let me give you a peak into the burning dumpster fire that is Twitter's balance sheet

Starting on page 43 of Twitter's Annual Report from 2020 [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020\_Twitter\_Annual\_Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020_Twitter_Annual_Report.pdf)

We can see Twitter pulled in 3.2 B from Advertising Services, 508M from Data licensing for a total of 3.7B in revenue

1.37B Cost revenue

873M in 'Research and development'

888M in 'Sales and marketing'

562M in 'general and administrative'

Twitter netted negative 1.1B in profit after setting aside 1B for taxes.

Let's break this down again

Twitter pulled in $3.7B but twitter spent

37% on cost of revenue: servers, buildings, upkeep etc.

23% on Research and development: software engineers, sociologists, artists, focus groups (market research) (I believe moderators is in here as well)

24% on Sales and marketing: sales employees for ads and marketing for userbase and available ad space.

15% of general and administrative: executives, legal, finance, info tech, hr, consulting, moderators (in both categories probably), customer service etc.

3% on interest and other: interest on debt financing, operations etc.

29% on taxes.

Yes these numbers add to 131% of revenue or in other words a 31% net income loss.

Why is Twitter so expensive to run, why is this dumpster fire losing all of this money?

Lets go back in time to Twitter in 2011-2013 - Here's the same report from that time period. [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf)

Page 57

Going to compare to Twitters Monthly active users (MAU) [https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:\~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)).

2013: \~225M monthly active users (MAU)

Cost of Revenue : 266 M (\~330M inflation adjusted)

Research and Development.(R&D): 593M (\~740M inflation adjusted)Sales and Marketing 316M (\~400M inflation adjusted)General and Administrative 124M (\~160M inflation adjusted)

2011: \~100M MAU

R&D: 80M (\~110M inflation adjusted)

Sales and marketing 26M (\~36M inflation adjusted)

General and administrative 233M (\~310M inflation adjusted)

Ok so lets do some ratios with inflation adjusted numbers compared to users

2020: \~330M MAU

Cost of revenue: \~$4.15 per monthly active user

R&D: \~$2.65 per monthly active user

Sales and marketing: $2.7 per monthly active user

General and admin: $1.7 per monthly active user

2013: \~225M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)

Cost of revenue: \~$1.47 per monthly active user

R&D: \~$3.29 per monthly active user

Sales and marketing: \~$1.78 per monthly active user

General and admin: \~$0.71 per monthly active user

2011: \~100M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)

Cost of revenue: \~$0.85 per monthly active user

R&D: \~$1.10 per monthly active user

Sales and marketing: \~$0.36 per monthly active user

General and admin: \~$0.85 per monthly active user

So what's alarming about this trend is that twitter is becoming very expensive to operate on a per MAU basis.

Let's recap

Cost of revenue went from $0.85 in 2011 per user to $4.15/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **388% increase**

R&D went from $1.10/user in 2011 to $2.65/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **141% increase**

Sales and marketing went from $0.36/user in 2011 to $2.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **650% increase**

And general and admin from $0.85/user in 2011 to $1.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **100% increase**

Let's see how Facebook does from their annual reports [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/14039b47-2e2f-4054-9dc5-71bcc7cf01ce.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/14039b47-2e2f-4054-9dc5-71bcc7cf01ce.pdf)

(M&S) Marketing and sales: 14B - $4.81/user

Let's compare to an earlier time [https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc\_financials/annual\_reports/FB\_2012\_10K.pdf](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/annual_reports/FB_2012_10K.pdf)

Page 58 and [https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/) (for MAU half way down)

2012: \~1B MAU (inflation adjusted)

M&S: 167M (\~225M) - \~$0.45/user

G&A: 138M (\~190M) - $0.38/user

As you can see, much like twitter, Facebook also suffers from huge inflated costs over the years of running their business.

I suspect this has a lot to do with financing of their servers through amortization payments.

But also trying to scale their business with the technology that was available 10+ years ago and not being able to change their business model because it was bad PR to fire off tens of thousands people and replace them with future technology, they've essentially been forced to grow with their existing business modeling scaling up which you can see results in worse and eventually negative margins.

Now we are talking about a brand new company with no existing dogmatic or scalability issues

They have already touted using AI in place of manual moderation

Their infrastructure that is based by Rumble has been touting as being 8x cheaper than AWS, a huge expense on these legacy media companies.

Facebook has 45,000 employees (1 employee for every \~65,000 users)

Twitter has 5,500 employees (1 employee for every \~60,000 users)

Facebook has much greater success of monetization than Twitter

Truthsocial will likely have similar success of monetization like Twitter except it will have substantially higher margins than both via means of reduced expenditures (cheaper servers) and utilizing AI in place of many employees. This also brings down the cost of office space etc. with remote work and fewer headcount.

This is one of the things they fear more than even the political ramifications is becoming obsolete in superior utilization of technology which they have can kicked to avoid a PR nightmare.

It would be much harder and more expensive to program an AI to be biased towards political ideas instead of more hard set rules of logic. It would require constant upkeep to keep up with flip flopping rules and exemptions etc. An AI would be a much more solid long lasting algorithm if it was free from these ever changing agendas.

In other words being woke will be obsolete by superior unbiased artificial intelligence. Also selection of ad space being removed from political and PR expense etc. nonsense. The free market will bid up ad-space and engagement to increase naturally from a more exciting and free environment free from biased and expensive bureaucratic moderation and selection.

# Lets Talk Share Price

So currently the markets are priced at \~72 a share would would translate to something like

40M TS users ($40) + 8M TMTG+ subs ($25) + 4% of Fox's audience ($4.16), \~ $69

You can see this is a bit comical for what's being priced in for a someone who is as well known as DJT who had over 150M followers online and over 71M votes in his 2nd run for president. We've all seen the portfolio trackers and many others get banned off TWTR lately. Pelosi tracker is back up on Truthsocial already

Here's a potential scenario

300M TS users (\~1/10th of facebook) ($300) + 25M TMTG+ subs ($77.5) + 50% Fox Audience ($52) = $429.5 and still have massive room for improvement

More scenarios

600M TS users (\~1/5th of facebook) ($600) + 40M TMTG+ subs ($124) + 50% Fox Audience ($52) = $776 a share and still have massive room for improvement

A total blow out of just one of the aspects

1B TS users (\~1/3rd of facebook) ($1000) + 40M TMTG+ subs ($124)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = **$1228 a share**

Another example

300M TS users (\~1/10th of facebook) ($300) + 60M TMTG+ subs ($186) + 100% Fox Audience ($104) ($52) = $590 and still have massive room for improvement

Imagine in these scenarios it will be trading for much more aggressive ratios **so**

# DWAC 1000

Kevin O'Leary from shark tank has said this is ""going to work"" search of O'Leary DWAC.

Speculated Possible/Likely of the 36 PIPE investors to be disclosed (another catalyst): Lutnick, Thiel, Musk, Schnatter, Chamath, White, McMahon, Salman,, Steve Wynnn, Bernard Marcus, Roger Penske, Carln Icahn, Rex Tillerson, Lindell . More info about these people in my post history and why, at least in some cases like Lutnick, Musk, and Thiel there is a lot of info to suggest this is probably true

# Short Interest and Gamma Ramp

There's been reported to be about 4-5M Shares shorted on this low 28.7M float. A recipe for disaster for shorts. Is also on the reghso FTD list

\~4M in SI and \~1M in FTD. At least. It's also been hypothesized that the market markers are only holding \~4-5M shares based on Liquidity Pool (LP) Theory Math (see post history) this would mean the Short to Liquidity Pool ratio is over 100%, reported SI is 13.4%, Days to Cover Ratio \~2, basically no shares left to borrow (100% utilization), cost to borrow is \~70% but has been seen usually above 100% and has gone as high as >300% at some points.

There is massive gamma ramping in danger of happening on call options and float evaporation potential. I won't get into it more here and now, check post history and google search maxpain dwac

# FUD

**Addressing common FUD - Understanding actual risk and nonsensical Fear Uncertainty and Doubt**

I know many reading this will get very emotional both long and short and will look for any reason to make this sound bigger or smaller or impossible or dumb. There's also many people who do not want this to happen for their own personal benefits. So here's some common things that are said and a general counter to it.

**FUD:** ""People won't want to advertise there""

**Counter**: According to CNN facebook was never at risk of this. This rhetoric never had much grounds in reality

>Facebook generated $69.7 billion from advertising in 2019, more than 98% of its total revenue for the year. And most of those ad dollars don't come from companies like Starbucks ([SBUX](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=SBUX&source=story_quote_link)) and Coca Cola so much as the sprawling list of small and medium-sized businesses who use Facebook to attract customers and build their brands.when COO Sheryl Sandberg said the top 100 advertisers represented ""less than 20%"" of total ad revenue.üì∑The Facebook ad boycott is starting to rattle investors""Facebook has an enormous number of advertiser clients,"" said Nicole Perrin, an analyst at eMarketer. ""They're definitely pretty reliant on the long tail of small business advertisers.""

&#x200B;

>Even as Facebook confronts by far the largest advertiser boycott in its history, the sheer number of advertisers on its platform may insulate the company from too much financial fallout. At the same time, it remains an open question whether many big and small advertisers can afford to stay away from the powerful platform it built for very long

&#x200B;

>""I think it's relatively unlikely that small businesses \[and\] small brands will join the boycott, because they're the ones most reliant on Facebook for access to their customers,"" Perrin said.

CNN's website  slash 2020/06/30/tech/facebook-ad-business-boycott/index.html

**Counter:** There will be direct monetization outside of ads (see TMTG+ section) also Companies will have to go where people are advertising with their attention and dollars. It's easy for companies to dissociate from where their ads are located when the free market forces their hand. ""Our ads are located in places that do not represent our beliefs as a company, we are solely interested in providing business to our customers despite their personal identities"" ""

**FUD:** ""\*The merger might fail or get blocked resulting in this going bad.""\*

**Counter**: SPACs don't fail for the reasons described or eluded to by the outlets. [u/independence\_hall](https://www.reddit.com/u/independence_hall/) has a great post ""The SEC and FINRA DO NOT have the legal authority or power to block the DWAC/TMTG merger"" please see his post history and read it. He did the leg work and debunked this. It's almost a zero chance of happening. See posts  \*\*""\*\*An update to my SEC/FINRA inquiry post and possible S-4 timeline "" and "" The SEC and FINRA DO NOT have the legal authority or power to block the DWAC/TMTG merger. Another COMPLETE breakdown of the SEC/FINRA inquiry, and how the SEC ALREADY APPROVED A SPAC MERGER in the past that was sanctioned by the SEC for lying to its investors.""

**FUD**: The roll out has been slow and unsuccessful

**Counter:** Actually no it has been record breaking and see the part of the DD above about growth rate projections. Anyone who doesn't understand this is comparing to AWS or existing infrastructure rollouts. I have not yet had one person point me to a valid example of a new platform or service rolling out faster at its inception with its own infrastructure. Also this platform was said be rolled out by end of Q1. It is not end of Q1 yet. TS got 1.5B views in the first 24 hrs -washington examiner (just on apple products, there are only 1.8B apple products.)

**FUD:** They Have Offices in Wuhan

**Counter:** So do: IBM, Deloitte, EY, Huawei, PwC, HSBC, Walmart, Fedex, Hewlet Packard, Pfizer, Apple, Uber, Starbucks, Procter and Gamble, Cummins, Morgan Stanley, Siems, Byte Dance, KFC, Motorola, Nissan, Alibaba, NIO,

**FUD:** ""Trump doesn't know what he's doing he can't even open email""

**Counter:** Trump just got over a billion in PIPE funding (largest in SPAC history). There's plenty of well paid people with the right background on the company. Trump is largely here for traction, which is the primary issue all social media companies face.

&#x200B;

There's also an agreement with Rumble to use their services

Also Lmao, linkedIn etc. FUD is nonsense, these guys are under NDA and are in the top 1 percentile of talent, networks not bound to these nonsense companies are not the sole arbiters of resources

**FUD:** ""This will be GAB/Parler 2.0 failure""

**Counter:** TMTG+ and the other services are nothing like the markets that these are in. Secondly Parler was becoming massively successful very quickly before it was pulled from the app store and AWS violated contract removing it. Parler is back now. TMTG is safe . Also it's likely Apple and TMTG have a deal since it seems everything is an Apple exclusive at first and their marketcap has been doing well (see that section in the above DD)

>**What Happened:** According to a [Variety](https://www.benzinga.com/)report citing data from the analytics firm **Conviva**, **World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.'s**¬†(NYSE:[WWE](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/WWE#NYSE)) **WrestleMania 38** drew a combined 2.2 billion impressions across all social media platforms in its April 9-10 presentation, whereas the **NFL‚Äôs Super Bowl LVI** brought in 1.8 billion impressions on Feb. 13.

>Everyone wants to know what is on Truthsocial, it is the digital platform for the entire reformed republican party with the midterms coming up. It is highly relevant in the culture war and the reimplantation of fair meritocracy based content (that is aside from politics) the removal of shadow banning, bots, and algorithmic manipulation. There has never been an agreed centralized effort for everyone to regroup. It doesn't become relevant until traction is there.

&#x200B;

# Rumble Reports added 9M users QoQ , 22% QoQ

**FUD:** ""Trump steaks""

**Counter:** Trump steaks and the other very few things like 'From the Desk' that were unsuccessful account for a very small percentage of his ventures. Those are also very different products in very different markets. Investigate this further if you still think it's relevant, you'll be surprised the actual facts and not what low effort FUDs would have you believe.

*The master has failed more times than the novice has tried.*

**FUD:** ""Myself and other have moral/ethical dilemmas because of our ideology""

**Counter:** I'm not here to argue with you to try to show you why everything is wrong, it's a simple observation that at minimum hundreds of millions of people disagree with you and there is a massive market for it and a demand.

**FUD:** ""Open source"" ""Bad security"" ""Software licensing""

**Counter:** Source is released and posted, security is fine. Android and Linux are OS as are many projects. There's billions in funding, tech people have already solved this issues for many other services. The issue is Traction. That's where Trump comes in. Rumor of Thiel involvement (he was raising money for campaigning with DJT junior recently)  I wouldn't be surprised if Palantir is involved in some way for security.

I'll add a lot more to this since I'm sure there will be plenty more to come.

**FUD**

Drop in downloads etc.

**Counter**

It's in load test phase, and still the fastest growing platform in history. Do your own research, fake news would have you buy Twitter right now while it's about to get clapped.

**Conclusion**

There's a lot of upside and demand that isn't priced in IMHO

I have shares, warrants, and calls and I believe full launch may cause a massive surge in price expectations once more hard data rolls in (in the coming weeks), if not then by the time the revenue rolls in.  The risks are often nonsensical or overstated by people with strong opposing political ideology and lack of financial and technological understandings.

The attempt of the top mods to remove all of us and censor you failed, thanks to the actions of the reddit admins. We are grateful to everyone in the community who stood up for us.

Unfortunately, /u/zjz will also not be allowed to come back to moderate the subreddit. This is a decision made by reddit, not us, due to the instability that was created by his last post on the subreddit. We know the respect that you all have for him, each one of us mods has that respect for him too. The hard work and time that /u/zjz put into the subreddit cannot be replaced, but we will try our best to keep the subreddit up to his lofty standards and our high expectations.

If anyone has the desire to code a new bot for us and/or the time to moderate, as well as the experience on WSB (at least one year), we would appreciate your help.

kqlnjn,2021-01-05 00:04:28,Why a Dem Sweep could Spell BIG BIG Trouble for Tech beyond Tax Increases,"As of late, Democrats have surged in the Georgia Senate run-offs, which could spell big trouble for tech companies sporting lofty valuations, especially non-profitable ones.

So why exactly does a Blue Wave spell trouble for tech companies?

A couple reasons: more fiscal spending, higher inflation expectations, higher interest rates, less valuable long-term cashflows, tech trade crowding, and hedge fund leverage. Let me explain.

&#x200B;

**Fiscal Spending, Inflation, and Interest Rates**

Generally speaking, Democratic policy favors a large government budget, and with hopes to spend over¬†$5T on clean energy/infrastructure, education, and healthcare Biden's team isn't breaking from the mold. A blue wave would make it much easier for the Biden administration to enact these policies. While Biden is planning on increasing taxes by $3.4T to offset his spending, the government still needs to create money to finance these projects, which¬†leads to inflation. Moreover, the Fed has taken a newly lax stance on its price stability mandate, and is¬†welcoming inflation of more than 2%, so it won't hesitate to let prices run hot to achieve its inflation target. 10 yr bond yields (and interest rates broadly) tend to be highly correlated to measures of inflation, as its a natural way to dampen the acceleration of rising prices.¬†

Summary: dem sweep = higher fiscal spending = higher inflation = higher interest rates

**How This Affects Tech Stock Valuation**

For all the retards who have never taken a finance course or don't understand basic valuation techniques, the essence of stock valuation is projecting future free cash flows and discounting them back at a risk adjusted rate (b/c $1 is worth more today than $1 five yrs from now, and there's not 100% certainty in the CFs the company might produce in the future). Thus, the main determinant of a company's value is its profitability, the rate at which you discount the company's cash flows, and the time horizon you analyze it at (which can be related to the discount rate). For those actually interested, you can read more¬†here. With the current fed funds rate pinned between 0% and .25% and the 10yr yield less than 1%, you can practically look out at a time horizon of 10-20 years before discounting back cash flows. Though still a stretch, interest rates at this level might be able to justify some of the 30-50x price/sales multiples we see in certain growthy tech names at the moment (DDOG's, CRWD's, etc).¬†

That said, if interest rates do begin to rise as a result of a blue sweep, and analysts are forced to incorporate risk free rates of 2-3+% into their discount rates at time horizons where these companies generate little profit, tech companies could see their valuation multiples deteriorate by 50+%. Even just pre-Covid valuation multiples for some growthy names would absolutely crush their stock price. I understand Covid brought forward significant demand for tech companies and in many ways permanently altered consumer behavior, but much of the rise of these companies is based on pure multiple expansion on the basis of forward revenues (not even earnings!), assuming low discount rates and near-infinite time horizons.¬†

**Crowded Long Tech Trade**

It's no real surprise, but according to a December BofA survey, the long technology strategy is the most popular/crowded among fund managers. Also, a year-end Morgan Stanley report indicated that hedge fund gross and net exposure was near all-time highs at 100% and 96%ile, respectively.

**A Quick Note on Leverage**

Hedge funds use leverage to amplify returns, and when leverage is cheap (see above), they are more keen to do so. If a hedge fund is levered at 2x, it has $100 of capital to support $200 of positions. A 10% drawdown would leave the fund with $80 of capital to support $180 of positions, with a new leverage multiple of 2.25x. If this were to happen, the fund would have to sell roughly 20% of its book to maintain its leverage ratio. In such a crowded trade, selling like this would cause another fund to liquidate a portion of its holdings to not become over levered, and this self-sustaining cycle of selling persists. An example of this price action and positive feedback loop is the ""Quant Quake"" of 2007 though its trade was less crowded and firms were probably more highly levered.

**Conclusion/TLDR**

A blue wave and higher interest rates (or even the fear/expectation thereof) could quickly unravel the long technology trade due to its crowding, leverage, and a newfound preference for shorter duration cash flows, crushing the stock prices of many tech companies, especially those that are unprofitable in the near term.

My anecdotal experience: Things are getting BAD. I've been looking for a new job for a few months now and I was getting interviews left and right in june. Things started slowing down in July and recently everything has straight up collapsed in August. Job postings that used to have less than 100 applicants have more than 300. I do realize summer hiring it typically lower, but the current hiring right now seems to be the worst it's been in years. Something happened over the past month and I fully think the US economy is entering into the much discussed recession.

ngftx1,2021-05-19 20:14:45,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer...","Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",6,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngftx1/funny_true_albeit_sad_story_about_mr_cramer/,wallstreetbets

**Cost to borrow:** Annual fee paid to borrow shares and use those shares to short the stock. The fee that the borrowers are paying are approximately 20%. For well over a year its been approximately 0.5-1%. 

Between the bounces of $50-$30 last year the cost to borrow was approx 1% which is $0.30-$0.50 per share. Currently we have 100% utilization since February. The current price is approx $6, 20% of $6 is $1.20 per share to borrow for a year in comparison to the 30-50 cents they paid last year. 

Short sellers renewing positions need to borrow at higher rates.

When a stock tanks and hits its low, in the brains of many WSBers... the stock is done. Why buy? 

Yet that should be the opposite mentality people have. AMC hasn't had any bad news for it to come this low, so the price action seems mostly short and not fundamental. What does a short seller do when a stock hits its low? Same thing a long investor does when it peaks. **CLOSE POSITION**

**How do short sellers make money?** 

They make money in two ways, first is by closing position at it's lowest point and second would be by synthetic shorting via options and selling OTM calls to do so. The problem here is the cost to borrow is getting expensive. synthetic shorting seems to be hitting a wall with the price not getting lower, the IV is low as hell so they arent profiting. Sooner, rather then later... the stock might have no where else to go but go up.

Now here's the thing... if it goes up from here, options are dirt cheap to exercise. Comparable to $50 \[$5,000\] per contract to exercise... it only costs approx $600 to exercise. If this thing were to rip, things could get crazy quick, exercising is cheapest its been in a LONG time.

This is why I am bullish on $AMC.

I am also bullish on $GME. Take a look at the DTC/SIR \[over 15\] and SI at 20%.",3,0.52,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1ka6s/why_is_amc_prime_to_go/,wallstreetbets

Hi

the recently leaked documents from Russian embassies indicate that the war between the NATO/Ukraine and Russia is inevitable.

My question would be how we can profit from the war and not only protect our money but make more.

I am located in Germany so my idea would be to invest in American and Russian defense companies.

Post war resources are required to re-build infrastructure, so I guess steel, forest, water, electricity, oil would be required.

What else did I miss.

ovp1ni,2021-08-01 09:19:47,short or stay clear of TLRY,"TLRY has become a meme stock with not much behind it. they put out great headlines but at the end of the day, they aren't doing well enough to any way justify their valuation. and this has been going on for awhile. 

a quick look at their fins says it all. before merger

aphria sold 41m usd in weed last quarter
tlry sold 31 million

after merger, they recently reported 52m in weed sales which accounted for 100% apha and 4wks worth of tlry. which meant they were flat in sales qoq. these are like tier 3 mso numbers. 

on top of which, they're carrying about 3b in good will (most of it came from tlry) and 250m of weed inventory.  at their sales rate, it would take them over 2yrs to sell that. more than likely they would need to write down a signifcant portion of that inventory at some point. 

and they're valued at 7b. 

now they're looking to dilute further for some red herring that looks like mso acquisition but still smells like herring. truth is 1) they need to continue to acquire to grow rev to (hopefully, but doubtful)  justify their valuation since they can't sell weed (remember flat qoq growth and ballooning inventory) 2) they can't afford a tier 1 or 2 mso. 

institutional investors only hold about 10% of their float which is among the lowest of their peers. hell even aurora is 18% (which, in itself, is lunacy). canopy is about 25%. village farms near 40%. 10% are mso numbers and msos trade on the OTC where most funds can't invest!

skip the company pr, look at the official fins, check out their valuation, compare their numbers to any mso, and you'll come to the same conclusions. 

oh, and the current ceo makes outlandish money https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/ouspzi/-/h762qcd.  note that the old tlry ceo Brendan Kennedy continues to dump his shares faster than you can say weedstocks. the guy is no dummy https://wallmine.com/people/64826/brendan-kennedy

the only upside is that they're heavily shorted so can run up wildly like we saw with their recent er. but once people digested their fins (which were released after hours when their headline numbers were released premarket lol), looks like reality is setting in.

ojpr1n,2021-07-13 21:43:52,SPCE Hypersonic plane,"Jeff Bezos is trying to down play Sir Richard Branson & Virgin Galactic's outstanding performance traveling into outer space this past weekend. 

Jeff Bezos is saying ""50 miles up is not outer space, but that 60 miles up is outer space."" Meanwhile when Bezos goes up (which won't happen because he's afraid to even get an elevator) they'll be going to the same threshold between 50¬†and 60 miles. The average person traveling into space without proper conditioning, will not be able to handle anything past that. 

While Sir Richard Branson has always been well ahead in the game. The comments from bezos show he hasn't been able to get over it, with all the excitement and news Virgin Galactic has posted and received. 

Virgin Galactic's plane was designed for hypersonic speed. Hypersonic flight is coming. The idea of a nice jaunt into outer space for a joyride sounds fun, nevertheless soon people are going to be able to take hypersonic planes as a means of transportation anywhere in the world within two ~ four hours flight time. That's the goal. 

There's also a big difference in the designs between all three space companies. Virgin Galactic is following the X aircraft design, specifically the Boeing X-20 Dyno. The other space companies are using old Apollo technology with a capsule perched a top a rocket that comes back through the upper atmosphere with parachutes deployed landing wherever the wind takes you. 

The most important part of Virgin Galactic's hypersonic plane design is the feathering braking system that lets the plane float down through the atmosphere like a badminton birdie. The feathering system is based on Rutan's designs. The¬†entire tail structure can rotate upward, giving the plane the ability to slow down and float like a feather as it re-enters the upper atmosphere. The plane then lands on a runway.

The adjusted earnings will be the wild card. I still expect these to be good and I'm hoping for 20-30 cents per share.

**Tax Receivable Agreement(TRA) and Incremental Loan Warrants, skip this if you're not interested in boring SPAC's tax & loan stuff**

TRA is a common feature in companies that go public via the SPAC route.

Despite it's name, It's mainly a way for the pre-IPO owners to continue to extract value from the new public company even after they've sold all their shares. The TRA essentially makes it difficult to value a company and to predict earnings accurately, because the TRA liability and expense will depend on factors such as

* The public share price during the partnership share to company share conversion
* The gross profit of the company during that Q
* And the applicable tax rate for that company

For $PRPL, good news is that on Q3 2020, the Pearce brothers had exited and converted 99% of their type B shares in Innohold to PRPL, with 99% of the possible TRA already reflected in the liabilities there won't be much surprises going forward. The not so good news, there's still about 130 MM USD left that will eat into $PRPL earnings the next few quarters.

The Share conversions and subsequent sales besides triggering the TRA also triggered an incremental loan warrant strike reprice, This is different from the public stock warrants, it is the warrant related to the loan that PRPL received from Coliseum and Blackwell in 2018. They usually put this sort of terms in the loan to prevent founders cashing out early. According to the GAAP Accounting Standards Codification 480,

[https://cpaclass.com/gaap-accounting-standards/codification-400/asc-codification-topic-480.htm](https://cpaclass.com/gaap-accounting-standards/codification-400/asc-codification-topic-480.htm)

you need to record the fair value of this as a liability. Unlike the TRA, you can calculate the warrant liabilities more accurately, usually they do it using Monte Carlo instead of BSM. Here's an excel sheet that does Monte Carlo pricing though it doesn't account for reprice probability yet

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paeexI0jD6mlj9n-me59tS4IPpq3bARJ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paeexI0jD6mlj9n-me59tS4IPpq3bARJ/view?usp=sharing)

And here's a pdf that details Monte Carlo for warrants

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVEblipoBpvz35c\_Zw0nYl2VzhIxY-TH/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVEblipoBpvz35c_Zw0nYl2VzhIxY-TH/view?usp=sharing)

The May 2020 share sales of the Pearce brothers triggered that reprice clause and reset the warrant strike to zero. So for PRPL since the strike is 0 and event reprice probability is over 90% with near DTE, you can just multiple the number of outstanding loan warrants x the current share price to get an accurate estimate. in Q3 2020, it was 24.86 x 2.6 = 64.6 Million. For Q4, since share price have increased further to $31, the warrant liabilities would be 31 x 2.6 = 80.6, a difference of about 16 MM USD from the previous Q. this is reflected in the statements of operations, dragging the EPS lower.

The order impacts 171 aeroplanes worldwide. **Required inspections will take around four to eight hours per aircraft.**

Current incident is priced in, the Alaskan inspection is surface level. Not like  they're gonna strip and inspect every rivet behind the plastic within 4  hours.

>The aircraft were cleared to fly again after Boeing overhauled an   automated flight-control system that activated erroneously in both  (2018) crashes.

Thoughts:

Overall sounds like shotty craftmanship and corners were cut on the  engineering of the MAX's. Longterm the depreciation on the planes will be sped up. **Just drop the price of these assets (planes) on the balance sheet to zero.**

Real Issue will be what the full FAA investigation will reveal. FAA may ground the fleet to inspect every rivet. which will take half a year rather than the 3 days surface inspection to just make people feel safe.

17bqia0,2023-10-19 18:51:59,"RIVN today is like TSLA in 2019, don't miss this boat 50+ by 2025","# My history on $TSLA

When tesla first launched the model 3, seeing in person reservations line throughout the mall, I started really looking into Tesla stock, fast forward to 2019, I went all in (and made this reddit account: TSLA4LIFE1), I sold some pre-COVID rally and model 3, but quickly re-bought during the downturn, and then sold some after first split to put it into WSB's favourite stock of 2021.

# Current problems with TSLA

Coming to today, I'm starting to see lots of similarity in $RIVN both on the numbers and valuation side, and also on the products, innovation, feedback, and demand side. There is no doubt $TSLA has been struggling and just offering price cuts to justify selling basically the same model 3 from 2018 in 2023. What was way ahead of the competition in 2018, is now barely on par, thus needing price cuts to justify the purchase.

# RIVN Demand

Rivian on the other hand, cant produce enough of their first vehicle - R1T, let alone the crazy demand, wait, and hype for the full sized SUV - R1S. Their products consistently get good reviews, have great quality, and are like nothing on the market.

Rivians are not only praised as top of the line tech, but also praised as amazing vehicles by Car enthusiasts, which is something Tesla always lacked.

&#x200B;

# RIVN Stock

So we have shown above that RIVN is a good company with good products, but is it a good stock? A good stock is a good company at a GOOD price.

&#x200B;

$Rivn was hit heavily with their recent news of offering $1.5 Billion of converting debt, which is maturing 2030. The stock is since down massively due to people thinking this was out of the blue, but as previously communicated this was expected sometime in 2024.

&#x200B;

Looking into the above I wanted to take a look at how RIVN was currently valued compared to TSLA:

[RIVN vs TSLA P\/S ratio](https://preview.redd.it/2p7ol800h7vb1.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b863bd29d2d37c264486bacdfe07a85d078749a)

&#x200B;

For pre income and heavy growth companies (RIVN today and 2019 TSLA) it always makes sense to use P/S ratio (MKT Cap/Revenue), and as seen above, from this metric currently the market has a 50% discount on RIVN compared to TSLA.

&#x200B;

# Cash on hand

&#x200B;

[RIVN vs TSLA Cash on hand](https://preview.redd.it/qwax3jl0h7vb1.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=67f9f20bf65a371b243174fc494b2382e482dd7e)

&#x200B;

RIVN has a MKT cap of $**16.512B** and cash on hand of $10.2B, compared to TSLA's MKT cap of $**692.374B** and cash on hand of $23B, so a 42x bigger MKT cap, but only 2x the cash on hand. This eliminates fear of further needing to raise cash for a while, and further strengthens RIVN's valuation vs TSLA.

&#x200B;

# Revenue growth vs. margin growth

Rivn is growing revenues faster than tesla, while their COGS is going up less than Tesla, now what does this mean? -> Better margins. Although still negative for RIVN, they are on the right track, and even as ELON keeps blaming the current macro environment, RIVN is dealing with the same macro, yet somehow increasing their top and bottom lines at a better pace then TSLA

&#x200B;

# Price targets and how long to hold

Now RIVN still has a long way to go, and I'm not trying to justify nor buying RIVN for the long term. I see the stock at a discount currently, but also realize it has room to fall back to mid teens. However, on the upside, I can see a massive run of 50+ before 2025, which is what my target is.

Many people got married to Tesla, which went from a good to great company, while the stock went from attractive, to extremely overvalued. Yet, many initial investors fell into the trap on not realizing that great companies as shit prices are shit stocks.

&#x200B;

I will keep increasing my position on the way down, and start legging out profits at $50+

A trade that should have been closed for 1000% profit 2 weeks ago. A beautiful trade in it‚Äôs sheer naked autism that has transformed itself into one of the most grotesque, greed fueled market delusions I have ever witnessed.

It‚Äôs become increasingly hard to stand by and watch tens of thousands of people, most of them with little to no experience trading or investing shout into an echo chamber of disinformation, the likes of which hasn‚Äôt been seen since Trump convinced his supporters to storm the Capitol in desperate attempts to overturn a lost election. While others, that actually know better and understand what a bubble is, ignore their better instincts and continue to buy and hold a stock out of spite for an invisible enemy.

I feel like I may have played a VERY small part in this with my CNBC open letter than went viral on twitter and helped turn our beloved gambling ring into a political movement. As one retard here put it, ‚Äúthis is not Occupy Wall St. This is Wallstreetbets, we fucking love Wall St.‚Äù So with that said I‚Äôm making a last ditch effort to hopefully wake people up and correct posts that are rife with outright false claims that are passing as DD.

People claiming that hedge funds are using options illegally to cover short positions deserve to be fucked in the street in front of the NYSE. There is nothing illegal about using options to neutralize portfolio risk. Everyone can do this, including you. Every brokerage lists this as a synthetic stock position under their ‚Äòhow to use options‚Äô section. 

People claiming ‚ÄúsHoRtS hAvEn‚ÄôT cOvErEd YeT‚Äù despite data released by the exchanges and S3 short interest data are also repeating outright lies and also need to have their butthole fisted by Warren Buffet.

On a final note, I‚Äôm going to leave the 5 stages of bubbles here. Let me know if you recognize any of these.

**1. Displacement**

A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a trade.

**2. Boom**

Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question (GME) attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.

**3. Euphoria**

During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and [metrics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the [""greater fool"" theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp)‚Äîthe idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more‚Äîplays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.Ôªø Similarly, at the height of the [internet bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internet-bubble.asp) in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) was higher than the GDP of most nations.

**4. Profit-Taking**

In this phase, the [smart money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-money.asp)‚Äîheeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point‚Äîstarts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) put it, ""the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

**5. Panic**

It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with [margin calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after [Lehman Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp) declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance. In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.

GME is turning what was a good idea into something resembling a 2007 toxic mortgage backed security. For those that bought under $40, well played, you did good. For those that bought over $300 and are still holding.

labtag,2021-02-01 19:32:14,REMX - The less volatile way to play derivates (rare earth metals) of the EV and Renewable Energy craze?,"*\[Posted this on another Stock Market subreddit accidentally (now deleted from there)\]*  

Disclaimer: Do your own DD. I am not a licensed/certified financial advisor. This is not financial advice. Just may personal point of view.

\*\*\*

[REMX](https://www.vaneck.com/etf/equity/remx/holdings/) is a Rare Earth Metals ETF that gives any portfolio broad exposure to all major rare earth metal miners and players in China, Australia and some more (e.g US including Lithium Americas and Livent).

This saves one from the hassle of trying to track individual Chinese or Australian RE mining / metal extraction companies while giving access to an industry that will be a key supplier to the EV market in China and abroad. The output of these companies is also critical for the renewable energy (wind) sector and electronics to a certain extent.

For all the talk of the US bringing back supply chains (or relying on MP materials), this is one sector that cannot be brought back in the immediate to short term. The ETF hit highs of 92 in Jan 2018 and I expect that in a high liquidity environment with policy emphasis on electrification it will touch and exceed those levels. The ATH of 2011 is 300+ but I am not sure how relevant that might be today (but is a technical indication of the last time we had a media driven rare earth metals craze).

In summary

\- If you are not sure which Rare Earth mining company to pick or you want exposure to the EV secular shift but are not sure which SPAC or EV maker will go to the moon, consider REMX (rare earth metals ETF)  
\- Solid performer over the last months, currently going through a pullback (83 to 75)  
\- Moves slow but steady and has strong tailwinds  
\- Not super volatile so easier to get out of if you find a new shiny thing  
\- OTM calls are cheap  
\- Most recent high within the last 2 years was 92

Full disclosure: I have one deep ITM call for Aug 2021 and some shares (small account holder). The ETF has done nicely for me over the last few months (got in at 40), and this current pullback might be a good time to buy.",9,0.54,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labtag/remx_the_less_volatile_way_to_play_derivates_rare/,wallstreetbets

The main point of this is if your bagholding here already don‚Äôt be a fool and get dumped on twice. When Ryan filed to sell his shares he did it IMMEDIATELY. There was no 90 day wait period or whatever BS the hopium dreamers was shouting about. He sold IMMEDIATELY.

With that in mind you should be extremely cautious about the company doing the exact same thing. They know the price of the stock right now is way higher than it should be. True it may down 70% from its recent highs but it‚Äôs still higher than it was after their recent earnings report. Which means it‚Äôs the PERFECT time for the company to sell some stock.

1arrumb,2024-02-15 22:12:18,"NVIDIA will cross 2,000$","NVIDIA is going to cross 2,000$

Listen up regards, today lord Sam 7 trillion Altman of OpenAI released an AI model to send YouTube creators out of business. (Link : https://openai.com/sora) Ok, YouTubers will soon run out of Tendies, how does this mean NVIDIA will reach 2000$ you ask?


Well to see the connection you need to understand a bit of AI. There are 2 big models that currently exist: Transformers and Diffusion. The thing about transformers is that they operate on tokens. For language a bunch of letters together form a token. ‚Äúab‚Äù can be 1 token, ‚Äúcan‚Äù another token and so on. Basically they do not think in terms of single alphabets but actually think in terms of tokens. So OpenAI took 100 million Microsoft bucks, 1 billion+ NVIDIA GPU‚Äôs and created ChatGPT that started this AI bull run. 

Then came the question how to apply this technique to images. Naively each image generates far more tokens than a thousand word essay and so understanding an image seems extremely inefficient. Transformers will not work, smooth brained critics said. Then Sam Altman pulled the infinite money Microsoft glitch and OpenAI trained a massively large transformer on an ungodly number of GPUs and showed we could perfectly understand images with GPT-4. 

‚ÄúWell ok maybe images work, but this will never work for videos, that would require an insane amount of compute‚Äù, smooth brained critics said. It turns out these critics just lacked imagination since Sam Altman proceeded to ask for 7 trillion dollars, more than the GDP of every country except US and China to throw more compute at AI. So when OpenAI says they will just brute force AI, throw trillions of compute at it and achieve AGI you better believe them. They have now come out with a transformer based Video Diffusion model. They never mentioned how big this model is, but it is probably bigger than GPT-4 . GPT-5 which is rumored to be able to understand and answer questions on video, is probably one order of magnitude bigger than GPT-4 and might cost 1 billion + to train. This means the market is still significantly underestimating the demand for NVIDIA chips and NVIDIAs price target should be 2000$ + in coming future.

TLDR; OpenAI‚Äôs foray into video using transformers shows there is far more compute they can use to generate even better AI‚Äôs. They will probably buy 10X the compute they already bought, from NVIDIA in the coming years in their quest to build AI. NVIDIA will skyrocket as a result.",6,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1arrumb/nvidia_will_cross_2000/,wallstreetbets

Second: maybe this last rate hike is already priced in by the market and that would mean if he‚Äôs hiking one last time markets could SORE because that would mean Powel is done the fight with inflation is over. The fed does not want the market soaring he needs to keep a restrictive psychology. 

So I think there will be no more rate hikes this year and will be forced to cut in 2024 as a recession starts to degrade the economy",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16tiu53/fed_is_lying_next_rate_hike/,wallstreetbets

hclbrj,2020-06-20 12:13:34,I watch the press conference so you don't have to: Why Florida will not be shutting down,"There is an imbecile in another post on WSB who's struggles to put his diaper on in the morning who's attempting to give shit investment advice about how Florida will need to shut down. In an effort to justify his mom's hard fought public school education that he got he attempted to use big nickel words and graphs to show Arizona and Florida are in a doomsday pact with their residents and they're all going to need to lockdown again, or everyone is going to die. As the title suggests I watched the press conference yesterday by Gov Destanis so you don't have to, and am here to give the corrected information about what's going on in the nations best run state. 

First, one thing to understand about Florida is due to the constant hurricane issues and the large old people population they have had the most detailed data and fastest reporting data in the nation. The governor does not get up on stage with a crap PowerPoint every day and have no actual color to add to everything, instead they have very granular data which cuts through the polical nonsense.  All data referenced in this post will be in the imgur link at the end. 

Second all their elder care facilities are still on high alert and locked down. These have not reported and travel into and out of them are still very limited and carefully monitored.  All PPD is directed towards the elder care facilities, with hospitals getting the over run. 

Okay now onto the data. Yesterday Gov Destatis had a 1 hour+ press conference were he said where the state was at and where it was heading too. I doubt anyone from this sub watched it as it started about 10 minutes after apple decided to tank the market by announcing they were closing 8 stores. 
 
In this press conference he first discussed why the number of infected was increasing. (Chart 1) he showed that all the new cases are from people who are under the age of 40. Which for 99.6% of all people will not result in death but at worse will be a bad flu. Further he went on to state that nation wide the only 2 people have died under the age of 30 who didn't have huge co-morbidities before they got Covid. Basically if you are healthy today and catch it you will be fine. 

He breaks the new infection numbers down even further in chart 4 if you wanted to look at age split.

He backs his claim about younger people not being at risk with Chart 2 showing how the death rate is doing a nose dive. If they were actually at risk of death and were dying we would see it.  Additionally, he said they aren't going into hospitals either, as there are more available beds now in June than there were at any point between now and March 1st.

So this is a crap investment group so I should post on what this means for the market. Here's the brass tax, young people getting infected is a really good thing. The world has seen at least 6 major Covid related massive illnesses that they've attempted to develop a vaccine for. Do you want to know how many were successful? ZERO. There will not be a vaccine for covid-19 either as it mutates too fast. There is only one way out of this, herd immunity. The faster young heathy people get infected and become immune the faster we can attempt to go back to normal.  Any doctor on TV telling you anything else is lying to you. Also remember, our grandparents lived through a great depression 3 pandemics and 2 world wars and kept on trucking. We can make it through this.

Long story short, invest in America buy quality long positions and enjoy the ride. Also fuck idiots telling you the world is going to end.

1aqocz1,2024-02-14 14:37:31,I'm such an idiot. Saw how much Lyft drivers were getting screwed by Lyft. Meant to buy calls yesterday. Completely forgot to.,"And now shares are up 21.60% before the open. Would have doubled my money easy at least. I'm so fucking stupid. 

I've been reading posts on /r/Lyft, and Lyft is taking HUGE cuts from the drivers. It's not a viable business model long term. In the short term it was obvious they were going to make a lot more this quarter. Seems like they are really fucking over their drivers. Tons of examples where drivers are taking home less than 50% of what the customer is paying. Yes some of this has to do with taxes, but the Lyft drivers' cut has never been lower. Very bullish short term, and I was right, but an idiot who forgot to place the bet. 

Long term I think Uber/Lyft are kind of screwed. They are making money, but still very little, and these drivers are going to start quitting. It takes a while for drivers to realize how little they are making when you take into account wear/tear/depreciation. So long term these drivers, who lets be honest, are below average intelligence (if they are getting paid shit, yet still driving), will eventually figure out they are making jack shit and would be better off literally working at McDonalds. Uber/Lyft will have to raise rates on customers and make sure drivers are paid more. Then they'll be back to making almost no money at all. 

The only thing that will save these companies long term is self driving. Get rid of drivers and have fleets of self driving vehicles. Although if Tesla does solve FSD, do they really need a company like Uber/Lyft? Why not just do it themselves? Considering how much cash Tesla has, I could see them deciding to build self driving cars for their own self operated fleet. 

So where is Uber/Lyft long term? Maybe they only survive if there is a second option to Tesla FSD that works nationwide. But that seems to be the problem, is these companies like Waymo are only in certain cities, in certain conditions, etc, and are not going to be able to expand nationwide quickly. 

My prediction: Massive devaluation to Uber/Lyft, more Uber than Lyft wince it is worth 141B at a 76 P/E. Uber buying back $7b of shares right now. Morons.

Yes you.

I wasn't bothering anyone.  I simply woke up, checked my watchlist, and decided, after 3 MONTHS - three months - of tracking APHA, Wednesday was the day to buy. 

It always moved nicely.  Outpaced the sector, held firm when the sector took a hit. 

It didn't seem 'flashy', or 'gambling'.

It was just little ol me, who had been enjoying 100% gains over the past 12 months, cautiously, carefully, casually buying stocks I liked and accruing them. 

APHA was moving, and I astutely determined, ""People are waking up that this is the right play.  Time to pounce!""

Pounce I did. 

That night, I texted a buddy.  ""Hey, did you see know that APHA was being discussed over in WSB?  I hope this price jump isn't because of those guys...""

Next day, champagne!!!!! Up 40% in 24 hours????  Boy did I time that or did I time that?

Here's my shitty DD, take it with a ton of salt cause I actually, truly have no idea what I'm talking about

&#x200B;

**Thesis:** 

This Friday and next Monday/Tues is going to experience the drop of all drops for GME due to expiring options being HEAVILY skewed towards puts

&#x200B;

Looking at the yahoo options chain ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&straddle=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&straddle=true)) and we end the week around the current price (say, $107):

&#x200B;

Total calls expiring ITM (strike price <= 105) : 16,337

Total puts expiring ITM (strike price >= 110) : 25,797

Net difference : 9460 more put contracts expire ITM, leading to an added **946,000 shares worth of selling pressure** 

On top of this selling pressure, similar to the gamma squeeze we saw on the way up with MMs buying shares as prices increase to cover the calls they wrote, **they will be selling shares as prices drop** to cover/hedge puts they wrote which are now ITM

&#x200B;

I have no idea if this makes sense

**Position:** GME 19Feb21 110 P

lv9ybg,2021-03-01 14:02:37,EVs are not the future! Please read this!,"Good morning my fellow fellows and non-fellows. I have discovered something that makes me feel uneasy and i feel that it needs to be shared.. something is BIG is going down, i have three things i would like to cover in this post, Rhodium; the uses of it, OPOC two stroke engines and the US Army and how the three are connected to a company that created this technology that just vanished off the face of the earth after proving combustion engines can be cleaner and more efficient then anything we can do with electric for the foreseeable future..

The Beginning of My Research : This started back in 2008 with a company called EcoMotors, i am and always have been obsessed with two-stroke engines as the power they can output is truly unmatched.. i discovered EcoMotors because they designed a two-stroke opposed piston opposed cylinder engine that would create a significant higher power output, using less fuel, including a lower count of moving parts and major cutbacks on overall weight, far surpassing the efficiency of EVs. Bill Gates was invested heavily in this company... then China got involved, a massive deal to produce 150'000 units of this engine was struck in China and then suddenly.. it all goes dark, no more news, no explanation.. the company shuts down, the production plant is deemed ""defunct"" and all of the information and patents owned by the company were privately purchased and essentially removed from the public eye.

Where it Gets Weird; Rhodium : As an investor i'm actively looking for the ""next big thing"" as we all are and i have a soft spot for precious metals ( they're just so shiny ) through countless hours of sifting through the garbage pile that we call the internet i discovered a PGM ( platinum group metal ) called Rhodium and this little shiny turd is a golden boy in the world of precious metal right now, it has rocketed from roughly $2'200/oz to over $22'000/oz from 2018 - 2021 with no signs of stopping anytime soon, the primary use ( literally over 80% of all mined rhodium ) is in catalytic converters used on internal combustion engines, the whole market is pushing EVs and yet Rhodium is skyrocketing in value.. it makes no sense if the world is going electric right? Very very odd.. 

THE PLOT THICKENS! : So now knowing that there is a type of combustion engine in play that crushes the efficiency of anything electric and that it's been around for years.. on top of that a catalyst metal that would be directly used with engines of this variety is rocketing in value behind the scenes while EV has the spotlight.. it makes you wonder.. why isn't it being used in everyday transportation? Because it's so damn good the military wanted it first, Achates Power landed a contract with the US Army in the end of 2020 to produce high efficiency opoc engines for all of the vehicles in the US Army throughout 2021. So ask yourself this.. if EV is the future, why is the most power military force in the world investing in the development of high efficiency internal combustion two-stroke opocs, we are being lied to above EVs and have been for years. Please spread this information, this truly is a very viable alternative to EVs as it wouldn't require restructuring our society to accommodate battery powered retard-mobiles. 

I strongly believe this information is being suppressed, it took me countless hours to uncover this and it's not a conspiracy, all of this is happening and i personally care deeply about the future of this planet ( i'm sure we all do ) people need to know about so please, share. I'll link sources below.

Been always scared of it. (Not that I have been conservative with my spy 0DTE trades, that's a topic for a different conversation) 

I was looking at the chart since the craze started last year and took a quick look and feels like it has been in a wedge or whatever the heck the chart retards call it. Obviously, I did not know which of the bottom line I should have gone with, but irrespective of which one I use feels like it broke that trend which supposedly means it would go lower.   


Butt, my question is this not what folks are seeing? Where do we think GME is headed from here and why? Feels like it is headed back to at least 50s or 60s.

jlslnd,2020-10-31 23:41:54,Election Results - Trump will win. Calls on GEO or CXW,"Gents, I am not here to discuss policies or who would be a better president, but here me out. Trump is gonna win. Fuck the polls, fuck survey data, fuck what people are saying. Just put it on mute because it‚Äôs useless. Here are my findings:

So I‚Äôve been watching these rallies on both sides at the toss-up states and yes, it‚Äôs very much one-sided. 

1. Trump has so many more people showing up to rallies and it seems like he has the physical numbers advantage compared to Biden. Well Biden supporters might be scared of COVID and might be watching it from their homes?

2. Well, that‚Äôs exactly what I thought and did some investigation. But, it seems that there are more people tuned into Trump‚Äôs live broadcast than Biden‚Äôs. Well, most of the people might be on Trump‚Äôs livestream to hate on him. While this may be true,

3. The like-to-dislike ratio for Trump‚Äôs live stream was 550-190 vs Biden‚Äôs live stream 100-500. Well, it might be due to Media Broadcasting Bias?

4. Sure, except they‚Äôre both being broadcasted via Yahoo Finance - least biased News channel. Then, maybe Youtube is home to more right-wing individuals? Google tells me that Youtube has more left-leaning individuals than right-leaning individuals. To better understand statistics, I‚Äôve decided to peruse CNN and FOX's Youtube Channels.

5. The haters of CNN are gigantic. Much more in comparison to FOX hates. Check out CNN's recent videos and look at the like-dislike ratio. It‚Äôs incomparable to FOX‚Äôs.

6. Not only CNN though. Check out CTV, CBS, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, etc. (which are all left-wing) and check out their like-dislike ratio. It‚Äôs insurmountable. 

The silent majority is real - and it‚Äôs going to be another 4 more years for Trump whether you like it or not.

xnf977,2022-09-25 06:09:33,NFTs are the Pyramid and Ponzi Schemes of Our Generation,"I know the ""no cryptocurrency"" rule but NFTs are only bought with cryptocurrency, but they, by themselves, are not cryptocurrency, so I'm hoping to avoid the mods deleting this post, but I can see why they would (I tried to post on r/CryptoCurrency but I'm simply too young and unwise as a Redditor).

&#x200B;

A pro-NFT argument I always see is, ""It's just like buying valuable paintings,"" I have never understood how anyone can make this argument and present it as being anything but ridiculous.

A real painting can easily be verified. Let's say you bought the Mona Lisa, which is worth almost $900 million. You would have the exact canvas that Leonardo da Vinci used and the exact brush strokes he made. If I were to take a photo of the painting and print it out, I would not have that canvas nor the brush strokes. Even if I could perfectly draw the Mona Lisa, it would not be verified by anyone as genuine because it does not have the exact features of the canvas and brush strokes. We do not yet have the technology to perfectly clone the centuries of aging and all the small imperfections that come with it.

On the other hand, NFTs are unverifiable. If I were to take a screenshot or click, ""Save image,"" I would have the exact same pixels, the exact same picture, and the exact same NFT. There are no special pixels that only you have. I have everything that you have in the exact same way that you have it. And unless I explicitly say that I ""stole"" it, you have no way of proving that the NFT is yours and not 100% mine, there is no proof of purchase, no receipt, no logs of money exchanged, nothing.

Credit/debit cards and cash can be tracked, but cryptocurrency cannot. The people selling NFTs can easily give you a copy of an NFT they already have, and you cannot do anything about it. There are no receipts, everything is the seller's word against yours.

NFTs have become the Pyramid and Ponzi schemes of this generation. They are worthless pixels paraded around as valuable pieces of art to sucker people into buying them, the people who fall for the scheme end up regretting it and having to sell it to make the money back, so they sucker someone else into paying for it and then they sucker someone else into buying it, creating a cycle of scams started by the original maker and seller of the NFT. It is a game of online hot potato where you toss the NFT around until someone is absolutely unable to sell it.",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xnf977/nfts_are_the_pyramid_and_ponzi_schemes_of_our/,wallstreetbets

18osfzz,2023-12-22 23:51:55,Fed pivot canceled by Houthis,"Not sure what the politics policy is on wsb but I promise this is important to stonks.

With the war in Gaza going on, the Houthi‚Äôs have been launching missiles in the Red Sea to stop ships from going through the Mediterranean. This has caused ships to have to go all the way around Africa to get to their destinations.

With that, freight costs are expected to hit $10,000 when they‚Äôre usually around $2000. That‚Äôs a 5x difference. One of the biggest reasons for inflation was the supply chain issue. If you compare shipping rates and CPI, you‚Äôll see they follow closely. If shipping costs go up, so does inflation.

Now, it‚Äôs not quite up to the $20,000 that it cost during COVID, but if the Houthis continue to launch missiles at ships and prolong this conflict, it could continue to keep inflation high. Ultimately the federal reserve might be forced to keep rates higher or even raise them again if inflation starts to creep upwards due to shipping costs. The federal funds futures market still seems too optimistic and hasn‚Äôt priced this in.

On the other hand, it‚Äôs possible the supply chain disruption won‚Äôt last long if the military can intercept Houthis missiles. What do you regards think?

x2sbxc,2022-08-31 23:43:04,Buy shares and become a bbb(y)agholder.,"What‚Äôs up apeists and regards. Apes are regarded but not in the positive way. Apes are actually regarded.

Allow me a moment to explain‚Ä¶

Do you actually like BBBY (the retail store) or any of their other brands?

My mom used to take me there as a kid and I remember she‚Äôd walk out with 7-10 items $450 later like clockwork.

What do they sell, idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Random ass sharper image shit and pillows or something?

My wife sometimes takes me to buy buy baby and we always walk out with like a $650 car seat or some shit. It‚Äôs absolutely regarded.

I hate their stores, they‚Äôre boring as fuck and I usually want to slit my wrists after walking around in their aimlessly for 3 hours while my wife buys soda streams or some bullshit.

How does this relate to GME, AMC, etc‚Ä¶.

I also hate GameStop. Talk about overpriced, customer fucking bullshit. When MW2 came out I sold my PS2 and my entire collection of games, all of my guitar hero controllers, and still owed them like $20 just to get my copy. They likely turned around and made at least a couple hundred on all of my stuff. Why do I like this company? I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶. Fuck them.

Remember AMC ??? Oh yeah, I remember being 16 and spending $80 to take my girlfriend to the movie, and get snacks. I hate AMC. 

Would I ever own shares of these companies? Absolutely not. The fact that these businesses still exist is insane. The internet solves all of the problems that these companies set out to address when they were first established. They‚Äôre absolute horseshit.

But that has nothing to do with the fact that people have traded and made a fuck ton of money on options contracts that use these companies shares as the underlying.

You get inherent leverage with OTM options contracts, and can put up much lower amounts of capital to achieve the same results that you would have if you held the correlated position in shares alone. If you‚Äôre buying long options, you‚Äôll also never end up as a shareholder of a dogshit company (unless you want to be). 

Most options contracts expire worthless so you‚Äôre also (most importantly) not giving the board of directors free money by way of share price increase that they can turn around and dilute you with. 

Dilution is a good thing if you actually believe in the company because they‚Äôre effectively raising cash that they can use for development. If you‚Äôre giving a company that sucks a ton of money, they‚Äôre just going to turn around a give their entire board raises for ‚Äúdoing a great job‚Äù for the quarter. 

Philosophically apes seem to be preaching a dystopian reality in which they‚Äôre all standing together and getting rich together and fucking over hedge funds but in reality the only people getting fucked over are the retail investors. Hedge funds are hedged (duh) if they have a manager that‚Äôs not artistic and can take on the losses (if any). Market makers make money on the trading volume, the company‚Äôs board gets paid, long term holders can finally sell their garbage shares, and options traders make and lose money like usual.

STOP BUYING SHARES of COMPANIES YOU DONT BELIEVE in. STOP EXERCISING SHARES that are OTM. 

If you do, it‚Äôs nobodies fault but your own. Stop bitching and putting more regulatory scrutiny on our backs. You are burning money. This is a CASINO, not an investment club. 

Regulators either don‚Äôt give a fuck,or don‚Äôt get this game. Any regulation ‚Äúto protect us‚Äù literally just makes it harder for little guys to have any shot at life changing money. 

PSA‚Ä¶ I am not a financial advisor. Keep being an ape if you want.

EDIT:

This is not FUD. I have and do trade options on $bbby $GME $AMC. 

Remember when we used to trade Lumber Liquidators and it wasn‚Äôt a cult?

TL;DR

Do your own research and don‚Äôt necessarily invest with the hive mind‚Ä¶. 

Simple DD

EDIT: 

For all of you conspiracy theorist hardos. Here‚Äôs a fun trivia fact:

By volume the majority of Robinhood‚Äôs option orders were not routed to Citadel up to and during the $GME saga. They were routed to [Wolverine](https://www.wolve.com/), but I haven‚Äôt seen a single post of outrage related to this market maker? They also have a [hedge fund](https://www.wolvefunds.com/).

v7afob,2022-06-07 23:01:38,Reddit will be one of the BEST IPO‚Äôs you will ever buy.,"**THE FUTURE OF REDDIT**

Look at you. You‚Äôre a male and probably single. You use [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) for your social interactions because you don‚Äôt go anywhere on the weekends and wait for market open to gamble your life savings away since you have no wife or even kids to care for. 

So now enter Reddit in 2022. How is Reddit going to compete with the metaverse and keep your cucked eyeballs on here instead of VR? Now while we all may think the metaverse and VR is stupid, it‚Äôs where our worlds heading. 

So how does Reddit fit in to the [metaverse?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/06/07/virtual-reality-check-when-will-the-metaverse-vision-become-a-reality/amp/) Imagine Reddit right now. You open it, and see a series of threads or questions on a server. You read and reply. 

Now imagine being in a VR Reddit open world. There will be a central lobby where everyone starts out. Ever play COD WW2? Similar to that type of [lobby](https://youtu.be/JrU-aT5TNBM) where everyone chills until they go into a certain game. You essentially choose a ‚Äúsub‚Äù to go into and you can talk to people in real time about the thread. So let‚Äôs say someone starts a conversation on wsb about how $KO is a buy, you‚Äôd basically be in a huge room with everyone else in the thread talking about it in real time. Reddit will eventually serve as the ultimate social server in the metaverse. The Redditverse! You‚Äôll also be able to watch past threads and talk to them in ‚Äúreal time‚Äù because it‚Äôs all VR. 

The sad reality of this is if you think escapism is bad now? Oh boy, wait until everyone just meets people on the Redditverse and they never have any friends in real life. Wait until your wife finds her boyfriend in the Redditverse and he‚Äôs jacked online but some balding 40 year old virgin cuck in real life.

**THE MARKET**

My guess is Reddit will IPO sometime this year. It may go down like $HOOD at first. This will be the best time to yolo. Now, my guess is Reddit will be bought out by Meta. Now most people will be confused by this, but Facebook knows it will be making the Redditverse. More people like Reddit than Facebook, so it‚Äôs perfect.

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. selected asset manager Sixth Street Partners to supply new financing, according to people familiar with the matter, as doubts remain among vendors and some investors about the company‚Äôs turnaround prospects.

Sixth Street is in exclusive talks with Bed Bath & Beyond and is nearing final terms for a loan of close to $400 million to shore up the troubled retailer‚Äôs liquidity, according to people familiar with the matter. Negotiations to finalize the loan documents are ongoing, one of the people said.

The company told prospective lenders it had selected a proposal for an asset-based loan, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday citing people familiar with the matter. Bed Bath & Beyond stock climbed as much as 30% on Wednesday, closing up 18% at $10.36.

A loan deal would help refill the company‚Äôs coffers and give confidence to vendors that Bed Bath & Beyond can pay its bills. The business has sought to stretch payments to some vendors, which have been pulling credit to the company in recent weeks amid mounting doubts that it could pay them back and a shortage of credit insurance, according to people familiar with the matter.

At least one firm that finances suppliers has stopped providing credit on shipments to Bed Bath & Beyond, the Journal has reported.

The loan is structured as a first-in-last-out facility, meaning it is backed by collateral but will only be paid out after other secured debt in the event of bankruptcy, the people said.

Sixth Street Partners manages $60 billion in assets, and has a retail lending practice that has made loans to retailers such as J.C. Penney Co. and DSW Inc.

The loan is part of a broader plan by the company to shore up its finances. Bed Bath & Beyond indicated earlier this month that it is in talks with lenders and its professional advisers to strengthen its balance sheet and would provide a comprehensive update later in August.

But given its high cash burn in the second quarter, the company will likely need to secure more support from investors to give it runway to execute its restructuring plan.

‚ÄúThe loan would provide a couple more quarters of time to show improvement operationally and appease vendors,‚Äù said Seth Basham, analyst at Wedbush Securities. ‚ÄúWhile we‚Äôre skeptical of their ability to generate cash in the short term, if they can show that they can improve their margins and free cash flow through the holidays, that could be a path to regain investor confidence.‚Äù

Traditional debt markets may not be a viable route for the retailer to raise new capital. Bed Bath & Beyond‚Äôs bonds are trading at deeply distressed levels, indicating that any new debt issued by the company may be prohibitively costly with effective yields above 25%.

The Union, N.J., retailer does have a path to issue millions of new shares, potentially helping the company secure an additional lifeline. Bed Bath & Beyond hasn‚Äôt indicated yet whether it expects to issue new shares.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre surprised that the company didn‚Äôt try to issue shares,‚Äù said Bradley Thomas, analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. ‚ÄúIt would have been silly not to at least consider it given where the stock was trading.‚Äù

The company has been closing stores, reducing corporate overhead and renegotiating contracts with vendors as it looks to cut costs, but its cash burn has deepened in recent months as sales have fallen. Unsecured bonds backed by the company trade between 15 and 30 cents on the dollar, a sign that investors doubt they‚Äôll be paid back in full.

The receipt of a loan may abate some of those concerns. Bond traders at Goldman Sachs Group quoted Bed Bath & Beyond‚Äôs bonds between five and 10 points higher Wednesday, people familiar with the matter said.

Bed Bath & Beyond‚Äôs shares have been on a roller-coaster ride, more than quadrupling this month through Wednesday as investors bet the retailer could become the next distressed company to harness stock-market exuberance to raise funds from enthusiastic shareholders. The stock dropped after activist investor Ryan Cohen sold all of his stake, but it is still up 80% this month.",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wwxfcs/bed_bath_beyonds_challenges_linger_after_loan_deal/,wallstreetbets

lhmw52,2021-02-11 15:22:10,GME was a game. Weed is an artificially inflated bubble. There is a much better opportunity to make money and help society at the same time.,"I am an economist and a psychologist, I've been on reddit forever, and I've always been a market index etf/hold type of investor (optimal balance of risk/reward) so I had no use for subreddits like r/wallstreetbets in the past.

With all the noise bubbling up about GME, I was curious to see what's up.   My take on what's going on:

GME:  Let's get real.  It's a doomed brick and mortar game company.  Boosting it was fun, but it's ultimately artificial and we all know we're unlikely to hand more and more of our personal dollars over to Gamestop in the coming years even if they come up with some kind of competent online strategy (it's laughable we're still waiting on that this late in the game).  Sorry if you're holding the bag, but there's no point.  The company doesn't have legs.

Weed: This is a legitimate industry with very predictable, steady long term growth as more markets come online with easing laws and regs.   It's not going to grow much more in existing markets.  Weed is just weed.   You can only consume so much, and it's easy to get sick of it.   It has some limited medical uses, but it's not about to surprise us.   IOW, the long term growth potential is all priced in.   Boosting it was fun, but ultimately pointless, WSB has generated another bubble.  Don't get caught holding the bag here either.

Psychedelics:   Ok this is a real opportunity.   The research on psychedelics is astounding.  It's effective in novel ways, providing profound relief from otherwise intractable conditions like major depressive disorder, and used in conjuction with therapy, is effective for helping people cope with PTSD, anxiety, and potentially many other emotional issues.   Unlike other medicines used to treat these conditions, it appears possible to deliver psychelic therapies with very minimal side effects.   As a psychologist, I am incredibly hopeful about the potential benefits it can bring with proper research and social acceptance.  As an economist, I see a world changing development that doesn't just boost the economy, but the well being of people as a whole.  Investing in pyschedics will actually help usher them into the mainstream, opening up more research opportunities and pushing back on the long-standing conservative stranglehold preventing us from discovering more about the potential for these drugs.  

In other words, it's good for a short term investment, it's great for long term investment, and it's a much more prosocial investment than say, tryiing to ""stick it to the big guys.""  I recommend the ETF PSYK, and the company MMEDF Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc.   Both are great entry points.

s6h41e,2022-01-17 22:38:10,"The ""WSB Friendly"" Ape DD mentality DD pt. 2 (The bears are coming)","**(DISCLAIMER: I've had trouble posting this all day so Im leaving out the links here, if you would like to see the links, go to my page for the unedited version).**

Hey everyone, oickles here! You may have known me for my Ape mentality DD post a while back. I wanted to give you a quick update on what's been going on since I've written that post and even further analysis on why I think Apes are fukt.


#The Breaking Point


Apes have been reaching breaking points as their beloved stock crumbles before their very eyes. One notable instance is going on with the AMC community where, their [stock-tubers are getting suicidal DMs from apes who threw in entire life savings into the stock hoping for a Moass.(I had to remove the link due to the mod removing it)
  This isn't a game, people are really reaching their breaking point with meme stocks, what you may see in the next 2 weeks may be huge selloffs. People are throwing everything they have to keep the stock propped up [see here](https://imgur.com/gallery/6PUWI9w).


This concludes that apes and retail in general is running out of ammo. The free money from the stimulus has ran out, life savings, any free money that was for benefits even has ran out and they are truly fukt. Apes have cornered themselves in a fortress of shit and are flinging it also at each other while convincing themselves that RC or DFV will come from the heavens and save them. The stocks cannot keep up it's inflated price and the stock will continue to tumble; it's inevitable and a reality for most apes as they watch their life savings go down the drain.


#Gamestop


Gamecock has been the front-runner for most stock investors, its wild volatile swings have been astounding for swing traders. Recently SS had deleted a user's post for making 6 Million dollars from swing trading the stock stating; ""They didnt want other users to follow his example"". Yeah they want the apes to keep bagholding because that's how you make money? You've been brainwashed into thinking that buying a stock makes you money instead of swing trading it. I'd rather pay 45% taxes on 3 million instead of 30% on 20k. I'm just saying..


Gamestop as a company is burning cash with no potential room for growth, revenue and a future. [The stock is essentially burning cash from 1.7Bill to 1.5B and dropping](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-gme/gamestop/news/gamestop-nysegme-has-debt-but-no-earnings-should-you-worry-1). The apes would have you believe that the price doesnt matter, the earnings doesnt matter, nothing matters except the DD and this is how you form a cult. You've been gaslighted into losing your money, your hard earned investments and hopes and dreams over a stock that will probably never return to the ATH you sold them for. 


Gamestop doesnt fit in the NFT marketplace and here's why that bullshit pitch is nothing less than copium. Apes with their short termed memory proposed the NFT dividend to expose naked shorting and start the Moass as to what they believe ""we own the float multiple times and a dividend to count each stock would expose the overshorting of the stock"". This fell apart when there was no dividend announced and the Cult leaders had to come up with another tangible lie to keep the Ape's invested. All of a sudden GME is a ""Fundamentals play"" when all before ""Fundamentals don't matter"", ""it's a squeeze play"". I personally asked Gamers how they felt about NFTs and they responded VERY NEGATIVELY 

Gamestop investors are trying so hard to preach and push NFTs when:

1. NOONE WANTS IT, OUTSIDE OF THE SHITFLINGING APES.

2. NO Developer who would issue an NFT, would ever lose potential profits to a brick and mortar store when they could sell it directly out of their own stores. 

The reason why GME is failing and so hated amoung developers is because, they resell used games and do not pay the companies of the games they resell. [Most of, if not all of the profits goes towards GME and this causes alot of lost revenue.](https://youtu.be/703cX_edBlk). You coukd say that game skins from Call of Duty are NFTs, but noone is going to GameStop to buy COD skins. You can buy the skins straight from Sony store, then buy Cod points and get the skin.


Everything is becoming mainstream, NFTs doesn't fit GameStop's narrative and if anything accelerated it's death. You can buy a ps5 from Sony and Amazon or UPS will deliver it, noone needs Gamestop anymore and it's earnings report proves it. Losing 500 Million dollars while increasing in 300 Mill in inventory is not bullish. It means less people are buying and they cannot sell the products they have to compensate. 

#FUD, Shills, Bears?

Anything negative about gamestop gets downvoted and noted as ""Paid Shill, Bot and FUD"", so here's what I'm going to do for the apes. Im going to list out some cult signs and debunk some theories about this ""paid shills"".

Signs of a cult:

1. The leader is the ultimate authority (DFV, AA, RC, DD grifters)


 ""If you‚Äôre not allowed to criticize your leader, even if the criticism is true, you‚Äôre probably in a cult.
Cults¬†begin with a charismatic leader who claims some supreme knowledge. They may call themselves a prophet, messiah, messenger, or an enlightened teacher. They can also be CEOs, military officials, politicians, and self-help gurus.""

2. The group suppresses skepticism (FUD, Shill, Bot)


 If you‚Äôre only allowed to study your organization through approved sources, you‚Äôre probably in a cult.
Cults view critical thinking as an infectious disease and every effort is made to suppress it. Doubting members are encouraged to isolate themselves from outside influences and focus solely on the doctrine of the cult.


3. The group delegitimizes former members (If you leave, you're a paperhanded bitch)

If you can‚Äôt think of a legitimate reason for leaving your group, you‚Äôre probably in a cult.
Because the cult considers itself the ultimate authority on truth, it can‚Äôt imagine anybody leaving it with their integrity intact. Thus, it has to perpetuate a false narrative that former members were deceived, proud, immoral, or lazy.

4.The group is paranoid about the outside world (Everyone is in on it. Amazon, SEC, DTCC, Citadel, CIA, FBI)

If your group insists the end of the world is near, you‚Äôre probably in a cult.
Cults position themselves as the sole refuge from an evil outside world that is intent on their destruction. Cults thrive on conspiracy theories, catastrophic thinking, and persecution complexes.


5.The group relies on shame cycles (As shown in one of my pictures, the apes need support because noone believes them)

If you need your group in order to feel worthy, loved, or sufficient, you‚Äôre probably in a cult.
Cult leaders trap members in shame cycles by imposing abnormally strict codes of conduct (usually prescriptions about diet, appearance, sex, relationships, media), guilting members for their shortcomings, and then positioning themselves as the unique remedy to the feelings of guilt which they themselves created

#Earnings and how to gauge them

Gamestop Q4 earnings are good however; we can compare them by a year by year analysis to see what direction the business is headed in: [Here](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/revenue)

Even with the Ape and stock boost, Gamestop is still a failing company that DFV fairly valued at 20-40 dollars. He never cited a Moass and this is what caused the downfall of most apes.

It's honestly a shame to see this, you guys could've been a market terror causing short squeezes all over and getting rich. You instead got yourselves and everyone else involved with your Moass propaganda and Everyone can see through your shit. (link removed)

That being said, the stock will continue to tumble even with the small rips it will have. Call it a bear flag if you must, but this stock is going to 20 fast and once Apes wake up and realize they have been duped, I could honestly see [terrorist acts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s4pswk/at_least_they_get_nfts/) being attempted on DD writers and RC for not delivering the promised Moass.

Apes, get out and get some help, reconnect with your loved ones and admit you have a issue. You can rebuild what you've lost, do not wait until it's all gone to try because this will happen [to you](https://www.joshuakennon.com/gt-advanced-technologies-bankruptcy/)

Edit: You can see users like Bigstonkguy that are making a killing from shorting. Shorts are not fucked, Apes are. I believe that Gamestop will see double digitals before a Grand Scale Meltdown.",28,0.56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s6h41e/the_wsb_friendly_ape_dd_mentality_dd_pt_2_the/,wallstreetbets
mdhjr0,2021-03-26 05:27:41,"OG's don't hate $GME, just a chunk of the people trading it: Stop being cultish it's cringey and annoying -- let's clear some shit up and dispel some $GME myths","**TLDR: You don't know you're in a cult until you know you're in a cult.** Let the downvotes flow, I really am not doing this for karma. I'm doing this so some of you change your behavior and because the sub matters to me.

Disclaimer: I have puts on $GME, sold my $80s and $100s on the rip down yesterday, and twice had shares/calls, and will perhaps have shares and calls again if it ever goes back down a long ways because I'm here to make money.

**My background:** Been trading this sub's ideas since 2016 silently, my prop firm friends turned me onto this place (they do listen/watch this sub). I used to post DD for the week from my personal notebook each week back in 2019, I had thousands of people waiting each Sunday for those DD posts. Someone contacted my wife/tried to doxx me on the street, it freaked me out, I deleted the old account (SoRefreshing). I'm not a shill, or a bear, or any of that shit. I work for myself and trade at home now. I'll start my DD up again when the GME shit dies down, I can't do the posts because: I would instantly get labeled a shill or distraction or a hedgie or some stupid other fucking shit which is the reason for this post.

**In short:** The people here that have been around pre-GME or especially pre 2019 probably share the same sentiment that they're sick of $GME. It's not because of the quality/length of time this has been a phenomenon here, or even the trade itself, we love when stocks do what it is doing because many of us play both sides and make money in both directions, but we hate it **because of the absolutely cultish and ridiculous behavior of some of the people trading it.**

Personally, I think it should be an instantly temp-bannable offense to do some of the shit in this thread so that we can start cleaning up the ridiculous cultish behavior but whatever, you apes do you.

&#x200B;

# The Right Reasons To Be In $GME:

1. **You like the turnaround story, and are willing to hold years to see it come to fruition.** This would be considered an investment, something almost nobody around here has experience with.
2. **You are simply gambling to gamble, and like the stock.** Sure, buy it up, you're going to have some juicy loss porn if you never sell (and if you're retarded enough to not sell at $500+ and again at $300+ honestly you deserve it)
3. **You like to not be left out.** I get it, everybody is buying it, so you bought some. Whatever, we've all done it. This is a stupid reason but exponentially better than the shit the new normies spread around the daily Financial Jonestown thread (stolen from another WSBer, credit for the person that claims it idk who it was)

&#x200B;

# The Wrong Reasons To Be in GME:

1. **You think a squeeze is coming to $10,000.** It isn't. People should literally get instabanned for saying this shit because there are people stupid enough to believe it. Granted, that's their bad for being so stupid, but this won't happen (I expand on that below) mostly because the system CANNOT let it happen. You're playing a rigged game, get over it.
2. **You think you're bankrupting hedge funds.** You're not. They'll get a bailout if you do, or another one of their buddies will step in and cannibalize them. Stop being silly.
3. **You have any personal vendetta or motive.** It's stupid to trade on emotions. Do it if you want, keep telling people you're holding but stop attacking people that sell or have a contrarian idea. Believe it or not: **Not selling at $300+ or $250 and having it crash back down to $40 with the heavy ass bags you have isn't badass, it's ridiculous. We're here to make money.** Even if you believe the turnaround -- it's stupid. I love some of my holdings but if they gain a pile in a short time, I take some profit off the table because I want to be a boyfriend and not a cuck some day.
4. **If you think every drop is a ""short ladder"" or ""short attack"".** Some people just sell their shares. Some people need the money and they shouldn't be investing in $GME if so but, that's life.

&#x200B;

Ranting and explanations of some of the points:

&#x200B;

1. **There's no massive squeeze coming, ever. The best you can hope for is to crush individual shorts into adding volume when they buy back,** but the hedge funds aren't the ones you're beating up on. Citadel will win the war in the end because they can stay liquid longer than all of the holdings in $GME combined. **More importantly, if they're still in, they're hedged, you can guarantee it. Gabe almost got the fund torched,** but he got a bailout from his buddies. Listen, they won't let it happen, it WILL NOT HAPPEN. If you are playing this for a squeeze, then you are in it for the WRONG REASONS. If the first run up to $500+ didn't get shorts out, then they re-shorted at $500 and covered lower. You can be guaranteed shorts that didn't are operational shorts (to hedge put contracts, hedge fund, **hedge**) and play into the price almost not at all. In the impending run up to $300+ recently, the shorts likely cycled again, people covering, and re-shorting. This will lead to compoundingly low highs as people are more likely to cover to not get caught under a squeeze. Each time it happens, it will gain less momentum, what you're seeing is weeks of consolidation into a price range driven by algos and the apes here with money. **$100,000 or even $1,500 a share** from a squeeze is a **COMPLETE meme.** If it hits those price levels, it's for sure massive whales playing games against each other, not because you're bankrupting hedge funds. To double from $500 to $1,000 takes another DOUBLE of the market cap. Today, at around $185 the cap sits at $13B give or take. To double to $370 would require $13B of inflows. Each time it goes up, it exponentially gets harder for retail to have impact on the price but also for it to continue going up. Institutions - because of their fiduciary responsibility - aren't buying this to put in client portfolios. More importantly, the higher it goes up, the more likely a fund has to rebalance the fund's holdings (IE: liquidate literally millions of shares) since one stock would then provide too much risk and they have a responsibility to take profits. The entire system is designed to work against squeezes like the VW one (which is awesome to talk about, but a completely different time, and different situation than we face now.) It's just not happening.
2. **The second time it ran from $40 up to $100+ was not retail volume.** This easily could have been a massive short from $500+ closing it out and riding up call contracts during their closeout. It could have just been a complete bait. There's a reason it floated around back at $40 when the algos turned off. Some days when you watch the price action the volume is dead, the price isn't jumping up and down rapidly, this is a sign there's less machines trading it. HFT firms likely jumped back on board when it got super volatile because that's when they make the most money, by scalping the spread. You could literally just be at the mercy of machines fighting each other right now, this could be some retail volume but the slow bleed from $330 to $180 then the crash after earnings leads me to believe it's far less retail and more algos playing the momentum. Sure, some of you are buying shares, but I think you are really over-estimating the amount of shares people have and the impact we have on this.
3. **There is no fucking movement.** This is the biggest one I think. You aren't in this together with anyone and you should stop with the ""hold HOLD!"" shit to other people. You're in this alone, either you're in it to make money, or you're in it for the wrong reasons. You're not putting a real dent into hedge funds, stop being fucking ignorant if you aren't doing it just for the dank memes. I know a guy that killed himself over money in the market, someone telling him to ""HOLD"" on a play, and he lost it all. Tell people you're holding, tell people you think it's stupid to sell, but knock off the shit with massively downvoting people that sell or telling people that sold to fuck off, etc. This is what annoys people from this sub that built the culture the most. Chances are 80% of the people playing this are doing so with money they can't afford to lose - if they choose to share their loss porn then they deserve the needle and should be prepared to accept it, if not, then you're in this ALONE.
4. **There's no fucking shills.** Not everyone that is contrarian to your confirmation bias is a shill. CNBC isn't in cahoots to spread FUD, there is a lot of veterans on Wall Street that have seen exactly what is going on before, multiple times. Just because they say the valuation is ridiculous doesn't mean they're missing anything. Real statistics showing 20% short interest instead of 100%+ aren't shills, they're just telling you the truth. It already squeezed. We just know this is a fucking pump and dump of gigantic proportions. It may not be today, it may not be tomorrow, but this mother fucker is coming piling back down (for a second time) and some of you are going to hold some very, very heavy bags. There's no way around it.
5. **You guys are just playing a big game of chicken with each other.** If you're willing to do that, fine, but this is just a $13B pump and dump. Some unnamed institution may be buying up shares to push the price up, especially today, since they have a vested interest in the at the market offering sale in order to raise capital for GameStop and generate revenue for themselves. I won't name the name because you can go hunt it down if you want to know.
6. **The turnaround is priced in.** Believe it or not, when a company goes from a <$1B market cap to $13B if it holds these price levels, the turnaround is completely priced in an you could buy leap puts and it's printing money, who knows what amount, but it's printing money. Also: turnarounds like the one Cohen is executing take YEARS, not weeks, not months. You won't see appreciable movement in the numbers (which matter, whether you believe it or not) for years. Plus they're massively restructuring, and the chance GameStop still fails is a lot higher than people here give credit to. They need to drastically shift their business, and I believe they will, but it's not even 50/50. It's probably 70/30 that the business still fails completely, regardless how long you HODL your stock.

Yeah that's all I have. I'm just tired of the cultish shit coming from $GME people. A lot of us who say that shit or tease you in the $GME daily thread are just doing so because we hate the way this sub is transforming into some ridiculous GME sized version of the ""LET ME INNN"" meme.

At some point, it's just too much. I know others have hit their point, and I hit mine, so I made this post. Stop giving advice or doing DD posts if you have no fucking clue because you're not doing yourself a favor just by getting upvotes for confirmation bias. I just saw a guy point at declining volume on a DD post as proof that people are shorting downticks. Like what, the, fuck.

Just because you've been here a couple months and lost/made 100k doesn't make you a market expert. You're just a brainless mush clicking buttons like most people here.

I have puts right now. Yeah, I think it's gonna crash, no they don't expire this week, or next, or the one after, so I have plenty of time to wait. I'm already so far green and others are from playing both sides of this trade up and down there is no motive in this post as far as wanting you to sell for my puts, that doesn't matter to me in the scheme of things.

It's that I really used to love this place, and now it's fucking mind numbingly difficult to put up with it for more than a few minutes until I come across a post like: ""Why is it going down"" or ""Should I sell"" or ""$GME BABY FUCK EVEYONE ELSE SHILL SHILL SHILL"".

Like, fuck, grow up, make some money, fuck you if you do, and fuck you if you don't.

 BEAR THESIS on   LORDSTOWN MOTORS (4RIDE)

1) Lordstown Motors ability to continue as a company is a going concern. The possibility they may not get the additional funding required to ramp up the production phase of their operations. Worst case scenario: They could go bankrupt and this will result in hundreds of families in Lordstown, Ohio without work. However, the moment they say, ‚Äúfunding secured‚Äù, this stock will triple.

2) Lordstown Motors future capital requirements; their ability to execute their business plan, and the risks related to the rollout of their business and the timing of expected release date for the Endurance. The Endurance is their all-electric full-size pick-up truck, the failure of this vehicle to launch successfully by the end of this year will be severely detrimental to the success of the company. **Lordstown Motors must release the Endurance this year.**

3) Lordstown Motors ability to obtain binding purchase orders and build customer relationships, including uncertainties as to whether and to what degree we are able to convert previously-reported nonbinding pre-orders and other indications of interest in their vehicle into binding orders and ultimately sales. While companies like Ford and GM have a track record of succeeding in the fleet industry, Lordstown Motors is a new upcomer, and thus, this unknown variable causes a high degree of uncertainty.

4) Competition in the EV industry, from established veterans such as Ford, GM, and newcomers such as Rivian, Lucid, and others can‚Äôt be underestimated and understated. This is a serious threat to Lordstown Motors that cannot be ignored. Again, **Lordstown Motors must release the Endurance this year to get first mover advantage.**

lelwdj,2021-02-07 12:52:29,Why IRBT might be the next big short squeeze,"Let me interrupt the GME gain porn for a second. I know. GME was (and maybe still is) the opportunity of a lifetime. Most of you think it will never happen again. But I am not so sure about that. In the last weeks it became painfully obvious, that hedgefunds have manipulated the market for decades. They have artificially deflated the prices of some companies by excessively shorting their stocks. That left them vulnerable. And we have just started to expose their weakness. While GME was a one-of-a-kind situation, there are still a lot of overshorted stocks out there. It\`s just a matter of time till retail investors (that‚Äôs us) will pick the next one.

I think IRBT is a possible candidate for the next short squeeze. It is both fundamentally sound and in the perfect constellation for a squeeze. Here is why.

**The Company**

iRobot produces the vacuum cleaner Roomba among other household robots. They have a pretty advanced AI and Boomers just love their products. Most importantly, the business is profitable, and the company has grown significantly in the last couple of years. Revenue increased from $656 mil in 2016 all the way to $1214 mil in 2019. For the first three quarters they reported a revenue of $885,6 mil in 2020. In their latest presentation they estimated, their EPS to be around $3.50 for the full year of 2020. This would put the company at a P/E ratio of around 34 at Fridays close. That is not too bad these days. Earnings for the fourth quarter will be released this Wednesday after close. The fourth quarter has always seen a spike in sales due to holiday season. And I think they\`re going to crush expectations. Short Interest data will be updated at the same time.

So we have a profitable company, that is rapidly growing, at a modest price and a potential catalyst. Who the hell would be stupid enough to short this thing?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5euzp/melvin\_capital\_13f\_q3\_2020\_put\_flags/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5euzp/melvin_capital_13f_q3_2020_put_flags/)

Yeah, that‚Äôs right. Melvin is. Among others‚Ä¶  
 

**The Setup**

This company has all the potential for an epic squeeze. It is not as ridiculously shorted as GME was, but there are a few other factors in play. Let‚Äôs talk about it.

There are 10.5 million shares sold short. That‚Äôs 37.6% of all shares outstanding. 

This stock is primarily held by Institutions. The Top 20 hold 48.5% of the stocks according to Morningstar. Most of them are issuers of Index Funds. So these shares will not be up for sale anytime soon. Our experience from GME tells us, that this is quite bullish.

[https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/irbt/ownership](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/irbt/ownership)

IRBT has a market cap of around 3 billion. It is playing in the same league as GME and AMC were before the squeeze.

Furthermore, IRBT is trading at a low volume. Last week there were only a million shares traded per day. This would put the short ratio (days to cover) at about 10. Meaning that shorts would need to buy up the whole volume for two full weeks to cover their positions. It also means, that shorts cannot have covered their positions already.

Due to the low Volume a sudden inflow of buyers would drive the price up instantly. Have a look on the chart at the 27th last month. That was when GME peaked and hedgefunds started to cover their other short positions to rebalance. The stock went up 100% in three days while most other overshorted stocks only increased about 20%. This was probably not the squeeze yet. After the hedgefunds saw GME almost destroy them, they\`ll not sit around waiting for it to explode this time. When the first hedgefund starts to cover, the run to the exit begins. The squeeze will be much faster than GMEs was. I think it will only take two or three days for it to be over. 

 I want you to know, that none of this is financial advice. I‚Äôm not recommending buying this stock. I‚Äôm also not suggesting that we should pump it up to fuck Melvin a second time. That would be illegal. All I want to say is that I really like this stock. Oh, and today I ate mothballs for breakfast.

tpte1y,2022-03-27 21:14:03,FB undervalued? Is the public constantly wrong about the moves they make?,"Please watch this entire video as concrete evidence that most things Facebook did / changed in their offerings first was met with absolute hate and disgust, then after some time absorbed as the new standard.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KvZ-KQWuJM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KvZ-KQWuJM)

I was watching this (as part of my nightly Jake and Amir routine) and realized this is basically what's happening again. It's just that they're sooo much more in the public eye now, so ""disagreeing with an offering decision"" turns into $100B loss in value a lot faster than it did in 2012 (time of this video).

qmowcz,2021-11-04 16:48:11,Tesla is valued fairly,"I think people misunderstand TSLA‚Äôs valuation. Every post that‚Äôs complaining and moaning about how crazy Tesla‚Äôs valuation is simply misses the most important points: 

1) it‚Äôs a subscription company. Tesla offers paid services in their cars. The premium connectivity package that cost $10 per month. With current production rate if 1 million EVs and 1.5 million next year, Tesla‚Äôs revenue will increase significantly not just through selling cars but also through the premium connectivity subscriptions. Moreover, the FSD capability is also going to be under the ‚Äòsubscription‚Äô model which will cost $199/month, according to electrek. 

(https://electrek.co/2021/07/16/tesla-launches-full-self-driving-subscription-package-199-per-month/?_gl=1*185lamx*_ga*YW1wLWZkZ01jdFNRT25KRXk4NjlYVjRLMEJUV2RPWDRkYjU4TG9tRDAyUDFZWWJ2RFVLT3NKRGlDeE1adklPZzlfc04.)

In technical terms, with estimated 40 million Teslas on the road by the end of this decade, that will add up to a shit ton of money that comes from software subscriptions. 

A good case scenario is this: (40,000,000) cars x ($210 monthly fee) x 12 months = shit ton of money/annual revenue. (Or $100.8 Billion annually.) 

2) it‚Äôs a utility company. Imagine being GM and owning most gas stations around the US. Tesla has the biggest and best charging network in the world that is only getting bigger and better. It is also opening up to other EVs which will have a subscription option or a higher one time payment option. And that already works today. 

(https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-supercharger-hyundai-ioniq-mach-e-test-video/) 

Also, not to mention the actual utility business of solar and power wall, which papa Musk mentioned that it will be as big of a business as their car business. And we do see evidence of that too. 

( https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/teslas-solar-and-energy-storage-business-rakes-in-810m-finally-exceeds-cost-of-revenue/) 

That being said, supply shortage is the biggest problem, but it‚Äôs just a matter of time before it is solved. 

3) It‚Äôs a Dojo company. The Dojo project is a mind blowing supercomputer which will be at the core of Tesla‚Äôs growth. The supercomputer that makes every Tesla the superior car. If there is a future with on demand robotaxis, it is one that as of now only Tesla is able to create. Monetary value will come in a form of subscriptions, licensing to other car makers, or direct to consumers. Either way, that by itself is worth a SHIT TON of money. 

4) it‚Äôs an Elon Musk company. Daddy Musk doesn‚Äôt fail - don‚Äôt bet against him. 

Conclusion: Tesla will be worth much more in the future and it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to see that. You could probably double or triple your money with Tesla within 5 years even if you bought the stock today.
 
TLDR: Tesla is aight. üåàüêªs should stop moaning, and start thinking logically.

Now that $GME is on the verge of squeezing it appears that $AMC has been anointed as $GME's little brother. This is a mistake because $AMC is diluting via debt to equity swaps and other forms of dilution. $AMC did a 600m debt to equity swap from silverlake this week and I believe they will sell more shares into the market this week or next week to deal with their debt load and lack of cash flow. $AMC is going to take this opportunity to de-lever and avoid bankruptcy. As more $AMC shares are created the squeeze will end.   


$BBBY is more similar to $GME and it was Michael Burry's second biggest holding behind $GME. $BBBY and $GME both have cash on their balance sheet, generate free cash flow, and have their debt under control. $BBBY is buying back between 5-10% of their shares through February 27th and will not sell shares into the market. I think some retards are mistaking $BB for $BBBY. Blackberry has a low short interest and will not squeeze but Bed Bath and Beyond is the the 2nd or 3rd most shorted company behind $GME. Melvin is short $GME and $BBBY but not Blackberry. When Melvin is finally defeated he will have to close out his $BBBY position alongside his $GME position. We can inflict maximum pain on Melvin by raising the cost to borrow $BBBY shares but this tactic will not work with $AMC or $BB shares.  


$GME is the best choice but the most effective way to crush Melvin and get bonus tendies is $BBBY not $AMC

I've also charted them all here in Google Sheets. It just so happened that both bull cycle 2 and 3 were nearly identical lengths.

As we can see each bull cycle brings less lucrative profits. Starting with 30,0098.56%, then 9257.17% and then the most recent one 1949.89%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mpmetrn6v8oc1.png?width=179&format=png&auto=webp&s=7644e6061884c6663f61e8813b08c08a15bb3a0d

After that I calculated the dropoff factor for each bull run. The first dropoff factor was 30.7% approx. Which means that the second bull run was only 30.7% as profitable as bull run 1.

The third bull run was only 21% as profitable as bull run 2. This is a 68% dropoff in profitability which I used to get our dropoff factor for the bull run we're currently in. I applied 68% to 21% and got an anticipated dropoff factor of 14.4%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4f9i5xb9v8oc1.png?width=176&format=png&auto=webp&s=433270044204eaf853daa8f2c0535094beeaec34

14.4% of the previous bull runs profitability (1949.89) leaves us with 281.28%.

With a previous true market top (weekly close) of 65,145 to predict the next bull market top all we would do is multiple this number by 2.8128

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7vgzxoobv8oc1.png?width=150&format=png&auto=webp&s=22142a34aa46518d72c93d26dcb1de531950ba76

Our next ATH prediction is approx 183K USD.

Since this current bull run started on Nov 21, 2022 (Our first week with a green candle since a bear market) we can anticipate an average of 963.66 days until next top. Giving us a projected new ATH date of July 11/2025.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ul1ez8sev8oc1.png?width=245&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0652203b9769e9184a7245424d9e4600bd4e869

The average bear drawdown is 79.64% which means we can predict a bear market low of 37.3K. The average bear market takes approximately 382.66 days leaving us with a projected bear low occurring on July 28, 2026.

Also worth noting that if we continue to see the downtrend of profitability in bull cycles that is projected this will literally be the last bull market.

&#x200B;

Alarmingly for BTC the 5th bull cycle will have a dropoff of 9% profitability when compared to previous cycle. Since the previous cycle will only be 281% profitable bull 5 will only be 27% increase in price.

&#x200B;

6. At about 1812 shares \[stock price depending, dividend depending\] you make minimum wage \[if minimum wage increases: just add more shares\]

In the 2008 real estate crash, Goldman Sachs owned a whole lot of toxic assets. They sold those toxic assets right before the crash, to another bank. When the crash came and the toxic assets tanked, the other bank went belly up because they now had those toxic assets on the books.

Goldman Sachs is murderously serious about making money. Making money is what they do. You want to own them \[partially\] because they‚Äôll pay you for owning shares.

The share price used to be around $200 a while back, the dividend was $5/share. That same share now yields 60% more. Keep those shares and over time that share will yield more dividend. The only thing you have to do is to keep them \[*diamond hands for the in-crowd\]*.

199wyj4,2024-01-18 18:27:58,Why I don't think NVDA party gonna last,"I know I know - you all think NVDA can reach higher than the sky, but here is why I say they don't. In fact, here is why I say they have already outburnt their rocket!  
Look at the list below.   
there are only 5 companies at the $1T club, and number 6 and 7 are fighting their asses off to get in. now lets talk about ALL of them, and why NVDA isn't one of them:  


1. MSFT has just this week gained supremacy and passed AAPL. There's no argue why MSFT is one of the top 5 companies in the world. They control more than 60% of all OS on all computers on the entire planet, they have access to us all with their products, and they control 22% of could services world wide with Azure. billions of users world wide uses products they 100% own, and profit of with no middleman anywhere. That's dominancy! That's not talking about LinkedIn which is considered to be the best professional social network, and they sure as fuck monetize this.
2. AAPL since they dropped Intel's processors for the M1 and later M2, they control end-to-end of their production process and have roughly 50% market share of wealthy users world wide, plus 26% of mobile users globally. Not sure if they truly invented it, but they have perfected the subscription profit model, and controlling the spending of their huge users base fiercely! And I bet there's a hidden report out there showing they control the majority of the top dome of socio-economic group. BTW a friend of mine working as senior full stack at MSFT told me they gave him a MacBook when he started working for Microsoft. He's developing MS-Office on a MacBook!!!!! 
3. Saudi-Aramco - I know shit about them, but they control oceans of oil and you know.... oil is oil
4. Google - 98% market share for online searches. plus, over 70% global market share of mobile OS and 12% share of  cloud service. All in-house and 100% owned by Google. Oh yeah, and don't forget about Youtube. Oh BTW - do you drive much? did you know that to avoid competition, Google bought Waze too?
5. AMZN - Well to be honest, I don't believe they have a strong valuable market place anymore and I am pessimistic about their retailing now days. In fact I heard somewhere (and I can't find it now) that they lost almost $10B on their forward sellings in 2022, BUT!!!! they earned over $20B off advertising on site which covers the returns and customer's care. we can argue about that, but we can't argue about the crown jewel of AMZN - AWS!!!! 33% of all data on could, is located on an AWS server. You know NFLX, DIS, and WBD streaming services? Along with Amazon prime, they are all located on the same fucking servers!!!! In fact, unless you're watching Youtube or AppleTV, if you're watching streamers, you're watching it off an AWS server! 
6. NVDA - let's roll back to it later
7. Meta - I do hate that evil empire, but there's no argue that there's no other company with as much user data as they have. Between Instagram, Facebook, whatsapp - if you want to talk or meet someone, it's probably through one of their platforms, and they monitor it.
8. Tesla - I hate Elon! I think he should be in jail for violating at least 10 SEC regulations. But he's still out there and roaming. I won't argue that TSLA is A-Z solution to car manufacturing. Everything is In-house as well, and the marketing expenses are 0!!! But in a world where everybody are looking for autonomous vehicles, Elon's got the most data collected in the world. When they talked about creating a center control for autonomous driving, they suggested Tesla will be the center since they have the biggest data centers dedicated for it.

Now lets get back to NVDA - 10 years ago, they were nothing. A great product for a special segment of hardcore computer users willing to spend $200-$500 on hardware no one else even knows needed.  
Back then Intel was God and AMD tried biting on them. But got no where close.   
Then AI kicked in, and engineers found out GPU are better to teach the modules rather than CPU and guess who's the best GPU manufacturer? wait no!!! It's not NVDA! They have never manufactured a single processor. They don't have a single factory. They do it all with TSMC (number 11 on the list, but around 1/3 the value on NVDA). 

Ok so they have the best design. Fuck!!! no they don't!! They use ARM technology to design their processors ($74B market cap). And why ARM are so important? well because couple months ago, NVDA wanted to buy them, so the US regulator looked this deal up, and found out these 2 companies are the only 2 companies to design such technologies and by buying them, NVDA will basically eliminate the competition, and be a full monopoly on ARM architecture processors. so how come one company is worth $74B and the other $1.4T??? because they design the best AI training processors.

WAIT!!!! FUCK they don't!!!!! haven't you heard?? AMD just steamrolled them with Frontier ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier\_(supercomputer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_(supercomputer)))  


AMD has had the best week in their life!! how good? $250B good. That's still 1/6 of NVDA.  
And wait, I mentioned Intel several times before, but what's the deal with them? Well in a nut shell, they have dragged behind. They used to have an enormous market share of processors in the market and they got cocky and neglected R&D while the rest rushed to innovate. But even though you are probably reading this on an Intel based computer, or have one at work/home, and they used to be the sole suppliers for Apple computers, Intel at it's peak was worth $273B (Jan 31st 2020). Still fraction of NVDA's worth. And in opposed to NVDA, ARM and AMD - Intel has always owned their own factories, meaning their worth should combine NVDA and TSMC together!!!!

So the question remains - WTF??????

We know the risk, We know the greeks, we know the logistics.. 

But is there something we don't know? The most important part of the equation is ""Implied Volatility""... WHO TF KNOWS HOW TO CALCULATE VOLATILITY. It's not a black scholes formula it's a black hole.

Do we really know Fischer Black, or  Myron Scholes, or Bob Merton? These dudes won a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, The most controversial of Nobel Prizes, one that many say ol Al Nobel wouldve never wanted. WHY?

 And then why is this a rule? ""information about Prize nominations cannot be disclosed publicly for 50 years.""

Why would they win a global recognition trophy for this formula? In my opinion.. I think its a formula that always creates an upward trend or more so creates an irresistible illusion birthed from institutions holding shares.  

I personally believe the whole market is being Squeezed UP by option contracts.  I believe i've seen companies go bankrupt because of over traded options or corrupt option models. (MDR is only one of my suspicions)

Supposedly, according to seekalpha ""**Trading** in **options** is truly a side play and has no **affect** on supply and demand for **shares**, among either **buyers** or sellers.""  

BUT to write an option you have to own the shares and to own the shares there has to be a **supply** and if I want the shares then there's **demand.**

ruqpsf,2022-01-03 02:36:47,QE is not money printing,"Obviously the narrative of 2020 and 2021 has been don't fight the fed because the fed has control of the printing press and will keep printing until the dollar goes to zero. Also that all that printed money has to find a home which basically flows into the stock market. I initially believed this narrative until I saw what bond yields were trading at and realized countries like Japan and much of Europe were doing QE for decades without hyperinflation. Here's a quick example of how QE works: bank buys 10 trillion of bonds from the treasury. They now have 10 trillion of bonds as assets on their books. The fed then buys those from the bank and the bank now has 10 trillion of reserves on it's balance sheet instead. Nothing really has changed since this is basically an asset swap and the bank could have sold those treauries on the open market if it needed cash as they tend to be quite liquid. Meanwhile the fed's balance sheet has increased by 10 trillion. 

Fast forward to late 2021 and the big banks are parking close to 2 trillion dollars at the federal reserve on a daily basis to earn interest on excess reserve. Basically what happened is the fed gave banks reserves and the banks in turn just parked those reserves at the fed instead of making new loans. This goes against the mainstream narrative that money from QE has to flow into stocks. My conclusion is that the stock market effect from QE would appear almost completely psychological unless someone has a different opinion and could educate me.",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ruqpsf/qe_is_not_money_printing/,wallstreetbets

YTD: -24% (after a 20% increase in past 3 days); 52w high of $100 in Jan and now trading at \~$50

**Short Interest: 33mio shares (23% of float) -** covering of the shorts itself can shoot it to beyond the price targets!

Market cap: 10.7bn with 2021e revenues of \~$1.4bn

Morgan Stanley analyst: We view Sunrun as the most compelling clean energy stock they cover, driven by minimal growth reflected in the stock, a growing 'economic wedge', low financing costs, consumer demand for reliability and convergence of EVs & renewables.

The stock is reflecting \~6y of continued operation followed by zero customer additions - meaning Sunrun will go out of business after that, which is nuts!

The rapid growth of EVs adoption will be a major source of upside and can create as much value as existing set of customers.

Addressable market is large and rising, only 3% penetrated so far. The upside potential is huge!!

$WOOF normally trades within a single deviation but sometimes breaks off it by another deviation.

The previous high was set EXACTLY six months ago according to the chart at 31.08, seen in the image below. The algorithms are retesting the six-month high.

https://preview.redd.it/f7erxe7mwa571.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=707372ca128423886a14bc454eae4ee7c096cc24

You can see the daily chart on Monday that the high went up to the second deviation, just like six months ago. It failed it six months ago. We had 54.5 million volume on January 14. We had 42 million volume on June 14.

[Daily on Left. 4-hour on right.](https://preview.redd.it/wyue26gtva571.png?width=1878&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3f74e3685038a08f6e2a190d6663060bd7dc802)

Will it fail to break another deviation? Typically, stocks that break out will increase a single deviation, as you can see in the chart. But this also means that there's usually a pullback before it retests it.

Robinhood faced significant backlash, and in January 2022, they [announced they had lost a significant number users](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/27/robinhood-shares-tumble-9percent-after-first-quarter-revenue-forecast-is-well-below-estimates.html), shares rose 9.7% that day. 

Not to be outdone, Compushill set up a ""memestocks"" hotline and lowered the sell limit for GME to a pathetic $214K/share, all while continuing to charge a metric ass fuck of fees. 

In retaliation, Robinhood today announced they will be shutting down the buy button once again. What's more is, after spending a year and half on R&D, they figured out a way to also shut down the sell button.

When questioned on the high risk move, Robinhood's recently hired Chief Moasis Officer (CMO), Vladimir Tentative, mumbled something about ""being in labor"" and then galloped away. Weird.

Edit 1: 

We have now confirmed that Fudelity, IBKR, Target, and E-Trade are also all in labor. Which is odd, because I don't remember retailers fucking anyone lately.

1dp3p6k,2024-06-26 17:02:05,$GRND - Is Grindr undervalued?,"I've been digging into Grindr ($GRND) lately, and I think it might be undervalued. Here's my quick analysis:

1. 2027 Projections:
   * Revenue: \~$700m (excluding new product offerings)
   * ADJ EBITDA Margin: 39-42% (includes new product costs, seems conservative)
   * Midpoint ADJ EBITDA: \~$290m
2. Free Cash Flow (FCF):
   * 70% conversion to FCF: \~$200m
   * Company guidance: $180m (using this to be conservative)
3. Valuation:
   * 20x multiple on FCF (conservative for a high-growth tech company)
   * Projected market cap: $7.8b
   * Projected share price: \~$50 in 2027
4. Growth Rate:
   * Current price: $11.48
   * CAGR to 2027 price target: \~19.51% per year

Why I think it's undervalued:

1. Conservative Guidance - Management seems to be underpromising, which could lead to overdelivering. They've consistently outperformed during earnings as well, and morning during their [investor conference](https://investors.grindr.com/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Grindr-Investor-Day-2024/default.aspx) they increased their revenue guidance for 2024 from revenue growth of at least 23% to at least 25%.
2. Debt Reduction: They should be able to pay down and refinance debt quickly with this cash flow. They've been making good progress here. [https://investors.grindr.com/files/doc\_financials/2023/q1/Grindr-Q1-2023-SHL-vF.pdf](https://investors.grindr.com/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/Grindr-Q1-2023-SHL-vF.pdf)
3. AI Potential: Their AI investments (like Wingman gen AI bot) aren't factored into guidance but could be huge.
4. Multiple Expansion: A 20x multiple is low for a company growing this fast. Any expansion could lead to significant upside.

Keep in mind: This doesn't even factor in the partnerships & ad revenue. Or the international expansion. These could make the stock worth $100

Risks to consider:

* Execution risk on new products
* Competition??

What am I missing? Does anyone have insights into $GRND or see flaws in this analysis?

2. Inflation. Whether you believe it‚Äôs transitory or not, it‚Äôs here, and it handcuffs how accommodative the Fed can be. The velocity of money brought on by reopening will only make it worse.

3. Stimulus expiration - 25 states have vowed to cut off boosted unemployment benefits in the next 30 days. Yes, there‚Äôs an abundance of jobs, but many will not be willing to work for less than what they were just receiving from the government. 

4. COVID- It‚Äôs not covered much by the media these days, but it‚Äôs still having a huge impact on other parts of the world. Additionally, new strains are out there which will be mobilized once travel resumes.

5. Tax Increases - Remember that concern we all heard about during election season? That‚Äôs still out there. Taxes will have to increase to pay for what the government just spent. Corporate and individual.

I fully expect to be called all sorts of names for being pessimistic on the market. Shit is going to hit the fan at some point, and the longer this melt-up continues the worse it will be. All I‚Äôm saying here is to remember that yes, risk does exist, and crashes happen.

ljbncm,2021-02-13 23:05:52,How to not get caught with your pants down for cheap.,"VERY IMPORTANT EDIT:
I was looking at some comments and reread a certain part of my post. When I say buy put/call options I mean to buy the same amount of each - same expiry date and same strike price. Often you do this near the current stock price, because it is cheapest, and because you think it will move substantially from that specific price, however you're unsure how it will move. It's called a ""long straddle"" spread, and they're especially successful in volatile markets. If you have a strong feeling about direction,  it might be better to simply buy one of the two options, and that's actual gambling. If I see another stock bubble up I know I'll be betting down, because it's easy to predict an overinflated stock going down.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

I'm a retard who wants to make money, but I've been struggling to make good plays. It's been a fucking rollercoaster, so I decided this weekend I'd  devise a strategy to make sure I can still swim when everything inevitably goes sideways.

I know this is a casino, and the point is to accrue debt - all that fun stuff, but there are always good reasons to take a long position, and with how things have been going for people it is in fact a huge gamble, and it's not always clear when to exit. God forbid the swing happens while you're busy with something else and you lose out on not only profit but a big chunk of your money too.

**During a rise**
The most obvious way to cover yourself is just by buying calls or puts, depending on which is cheaper at the moment. After steady growth over some period of time puts will almost always be cheaper, and the puts you buy during this growth period might very well be more expensive than the stock you had in the first place if the stock tanks 30%. Even if you buy cheaper puts that don't completely cover you, you stand in a much better position to exit.

**Stagnant period after massive growth**
For some reason this is where people think they should buy in, but I assure you if you weren't there for the rise you're literally going to end up buying stock from degenerates who just got rich, your grandmother or a weed farmer. I suggest buying puts below the stock price and moving on to something else, but if you find yourself here with a long position after just getting a nice gain it's important to do one of a few things:

1) get out of there, what the fuck are you waiting for

2) sell everything and buy the calls and puts closest to the stock price

3) sell everything and gamble on one particular direction

4) did I mention to sell everything? I've been mentally compiling data on what happens after a price shoots up like 50% in a day, and I've come to a conclusion. DO NOT WRITE ANY FUCKING COVERED CALL POSITIONS. God, I fucking hate myself so much for this one... At least I got all that premium money, right?

I know all of these positions are pretty gay and bearish, but every one of these meme stocks seem to be overrun by people with amnesia. They looked at a green graph and said ""oh, gee, better buy 1000 calls before I miss out"". It's ridiculously easy to guess when something is completely overvalued, and you can make a lot of money like that too.

**On the other hand**
Alright, I know this is all obvious for many, and I'm probably just wasting my time writing this whole thing, but the opposite applies to falling markets. I already sort of mentioned this, but once the price seems to level off after a drop is when you could stand to make easy money off of uncertainty by just buying calls/puts near the current price. If you caught the stock at its ATH and loaded up on puts, then you probably don't care about this stock anymore and can finally move out of the basement.

l89baf,2021-01-30 00:38:56,Are we inadvertently blaming the wrong people?,"EDIT: I have been made aware RH is their own clearing house. If so, then that shit's fucked and fuck them.

These last two days we‚Äôve seen insane backlash against RH, and, on the surface, for seemingly good reason: they restricted our ability to purchase GME among other shares, at a very important time! THEY SUPPRESSED RETAIL DEMAND DURING A SHORT SQUEEZE.

But I don‚Äôt think this was a decision they willingly made, nor do I think they made it in defense of the shorters (although it did inadvertently help them).

I‚Äôve read a few things, and correct me if I‚Äôm mistaken about any of them, that point to the clearing houses being responsible for RH‚Äôs inability to allow its customers to trade. The most recent evidence showcasing over 50+ shares that they‚Äôre restricting trading on, clearly indicates RH is experiencing a liquidity crisis. Why? Clearing houses increased RH‚Äôs margin requirements while conducting trades in their behalf. Not just RH‚Äôs, but many other brokers as well. 

When a trade is made, the clearing house is the intermediary. Let say you want to buy 1k of GME. RH takes your order, and gives it to the clearing house (it goes through citadel too but let‚Äôs ignore that for a moment) and the house finds a seller. They match you together, and the clearing house buys (with their own money) the share you want, gives it to you, and gets your money, but not right away. It typically processes for something around 2 days. They provide temporary liquidity to guarantee sellers get their funds immediately, and they require RH to also put up a portion of that temporary liquidity, as collateral (margin).

So what happened? The margin RH was required to put up increased from anywhere from 30% to 100%. That means if you buy 1k of shares, RH used to only need to show 300. Now they have to show 1k. And if they don‚Äôt, I assume they end up out of compliance, which leaves them liable to a lot of bad shit.

What happens if RH doesn‚Äôt have the liquidity to show 100% margin? They can‚Äôt take your trade, because they‚Äôd be out of compliance! So they reduce the amount of shares customers can buy to remain within liquidity margins. Same for other brokers as well. It seems really bad with RH however, because now they‚Äôve increased their reduced stock list to companies like Starbucks and GM. Wild. And with all the public backlash, customers are also probably trying to withdraw funds, causing a liquidity crisis feedback loop.

Now here‚Äôs the part that worries me, and again, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. RH innovated by allowing retail traders to trade for free, without fees. Their competition was forced to capitulate to these new standards. No fees, means easier trades for retail. Primarily, in the past, retail‚Äôs most common trade (and still probably today) were long term holds. If RH goes away, there‚Äôs a chance we see a reiteration of trading fees.

There‚Äôs also a chance we see more option restrictions on retail as well. The squeezes we‚Äôve been seeing happened, in part, because a purchase of an option causes the seller to go out and purchase shares to cover, in case the option is exercised. The relative price of purchasing an otm option is significantly less than of purchasing the underlying stock itself, but if many options are purchased, much of the stock gets purchased, and we see these types of gamma squeezes. RH enabled this.

At most the retail can bring the price up like $5 judging by the price action last week. And the shorts have been fucking with options for 2 fucking weeks because they can't do anything with dried up shares.

Only way to fuck shorts now with retail buying power?

OPTIONS.

That's why I sold half of my shares and bought FD(options expiring very soon) CALLS

Go to [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) if you want to hold your fucking shares

We initially started to have explosive price actions at +$70 and $100.

That's because there was a fuckt ton of demand in OTM call options for GME. about 100k+ in OTM CALL options.

Don't know what gamma squeeze or options are? Let me give you a ELI5 version

Gamma squeeze = big money buying a shit ton of shares to cover their asses from selling call options to you.

Call options = you make x10 more of your money than holding shares but higher risks are involved.

Basically the more call options we hold the more MMs will have to buy up already dried up shares.

If you have no idea about options watch this video /watch?v=CRhGikRHSu8 and educate yourself. You will become very rich if you play it right.

 **Debt** 

Ford debt on their balance sheet that appears under long term debt heading is actually ‚ÄúNOT DEBT‚Äù that huge debt figure is the lending arm of Ford which essentially means:

1.  Ford lends people to buy cars and people pay them interest and principal over period of agreed terms. 

2.  This debt is the same as banks asset where in a bank makes money on interest payments Therefore, Debt in their balance sheet is long terms loans that ford made, and best part is in the high interest rate environment Ford is going to make more money in interest payments more than ever!!

&#x200B;

 **EV Strategy**

Ford Ev strategy is fierce and aggressive. Jim Farley understands that he needs to beat Tesla no matter what. He poached the best people from Tesla who have spent over a decade in tesla to ensure that Ford designs and builds better ev cars.  He is partnering with chip manufacturing firm Global foundries to get a better deal on chips. Surprisingly ford has partnered with Google in lot of skill building projects. It is possible that we may see a future partnership between google and ford for their EV software. Jim knows that they need a software partner to optimize their designs and builds. 

&#x200B;

**Previous Post** 

&#x200B;

¬∑  **Product Line**

Tesla have limited product line when it comes to EV‚Äôs, their most popular one model 3 and Y whereas Ford has better product line both in Consumer and Commercial including MachE, F-150 lighting and commercial EV vehicles. Ford is racing ahead in the commercial EV line and already has contracts with Walmart and others. Ford has the capability to deliver the commercial vehicles in 2022 -23 to businesses. 

¬∑  **Margins**

Tesla‚Äôs biggest strength is their margins -Gross margin ‚Äì 30%, Net Margin- 15% - 17% 

Ford has lower margins (Gross ‚Äì 15%, Net -8%) because they have lived in the old ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) world of lower margins However that‚Äôs changing and will change the path of Ford history of margins. The new blood in Ford has learned to focus and reduce the margins from Tesla itself and they are working to reduce cost and increase margins. Most likely they will take margins to next level in 2-3 years. 

¬∑  **Valuation & Market Share** 

The most controversial point that has jaded the most of us. Tesla has 900 billion valuation vs Ford‚Äôs barely $79 billion valuation. Given that Tesla‚Äôs revenue of 2021 - $53 Billion vs Fords $136 billion revenue. Ford being veteran and a value stock with dividends has been given lowest multiples of PE , Price to share for years because people never  thought that they would change or start a new product line, That‚Äôs changing now!! 

Tesla has 70% market share in EV market and Ford with 5% but that‚Äôs about to change drastically. In a matter of couple of years Tesla will loose their ground in EV landscape and Ford will increase its market share to over 15% with their aggressive line of EV‚Äôs 

¬∑  **Moat**

Tesla had the moat with its manufacturing batteries, EV‚Äôs and automation. With time and effort that‚Äôs diluting and other auto manufactures have been able to manage to produce EV‚Äôs and batteries and eventually they will reach to automation as well. Ford is in the best position to beat Tesla in terms of higher quality EV, batteries and automation. 

¬∑  **Marketing**

Tesla resonates with urban people and millennials which is good but Ford being 100-year-old firm comes with huge brand name and solid loyal customers. Fords new line of EV marketing and advertising has already done excellent job and proof is that they have over 270,000 orders within an year!!

¬∑  **High Interest rate Environment** 

We are moving in high interest rate environment with global rate increases. Tesla is still labeled as growth stock in portfolio baskets and Ford has value stock label for decades. Ford has been rewarding shareholders with dividends. This high interest rate environment is better for Ford and Tesla will see winter. 

¬∑  **Team**

Last but not the least. Obviously, Tesla has proven for years being a solid team of technologist and path breakers under musk leadership. Ford‚Äôs new CEO Jim Farley is best CEO ford has got in over several decades. Jim has clarity of vision and can execute that vision with smart and effective decisions. Within period of an year or so, he has taken steps to transform Ford to be a New age Auto manufacturer.",0,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/spah9v/f_ford_price_target_50_tsla_price_target_500/,wallstreetbets

This is the inflection point for Lordstown. Fraudulent management is out, they affirmed they have cash to operate until mid 2022 (even without this funding) and have affirmed production in September several times.

Catalysts to follow this initial good news:
-AVTM loan
-New CEO
-Production commencement in Sept.
-Projected sales figures

This is a real truck that has passed safety tests and a real factory that is tooled up. Previous management sucked and sunk the stock price into the dirt. There are some lawsuits over some phony preorders that they‚Äôll have to pay fines for‚Ä¶ which every EV SPAC is subject to in one way or another.

laxp6m,2021-02-02 15:09:32,"Some thoughts on SILVER, GME and game changing events with dragons and stuff","# Disclaimer:

I   am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I barely   understand how the stock market works. Professionally I'm a   computational researcher -- my job is to simulate complex systems that   my smooth brain barely understands.

Okay fellow retards,

loooong time lurker and europoor autist. So excuse my spelling. Let‚Äôs brake some things down:

SILVER:

It‚Äôs   a real well played scheme on this. You have to remember there is a   dragon in the east, where people have a historically deep bonding to   silver. And the dragon looooves to take a gamble. So, number one   priority for Melvin and hedge fund friends is to distract the dragon   from GME with shiny silver. Imagine HFs did not throatfuck GME on   Thursday and the dragon banged into the marked, heavy. This uprising of   the dragon is exactly what this autist observed by comments on wsb late   Wednesday, early Thursday. If HFs didn‚Äôt screw the market exactly this   moment and pulled some silver shiny stuff out of their pockets, they   would have already been toast.

Besides   that, try to find silver shorts/put options for a reasonable   spread/price which are also available to buy. I tried the whole day   yesterday but at least at my europoor broker I couldn‚Äôt find a single   one. What tells you that? Looks like **smart money is not buying the silver rush**.

&#x200B;

ANTI GME  BOTS:

These guys are getting their **bots more and more angry and aggressive**   over the last 24h. But why would they still take the effort, if they  already hit their targets? All this shows to my retarded autist smooth   brain is that they are in deep fear! Hey, bot guys I just want to quote   one of your clients: ‚ÄúWhat's your beef with me. I'm just trying to make  a  living just like you‚Äù ...I hope you guys got payed in advance,  because  your clients will likely go out of business!

Anyways... just to repeat **the obvious: They try to create fear among you retards** and make your diamond hands become weak ass toilet paper!

To   close this part I just want to quote some famous investor from Omaha:   (Be) ‚Äúfearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are   fearful.‚Äù I‚Äôm an autist, I don‚Äôt feel fearful at all. I simply can‚Äôt‚Ä¶   But for some reason the bot guys are. They seem fearful as fuck to me.

&#x200B;

SHORT INTEREST RATIOS:

So I hope most of you guys realized, they simply changed the formula to calculate **SI rates**. It‚Äôs basically **still \~120%**.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\_this\_they\_are\_screwed\_numbers\_dont\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)

In science you would say they normalized the standardization:

You   take your observed value also into account and add it to your base   value. Eventually your maximum number can only be <=1 or in other   terms <=100%, In this specific case you take your number of shorted   stocks and add them to the float as a base value. Then you divide your   number of shorted stocks by the base value (including shorted stocks)   which can only be smaller then 1 or 100% in respective. ...inflate the   base to make things look completely different‚Ä¶ Anyways my smooth brain   is able to convert the equation to the old standard (shorts/float) which   is based on S3s latest 55% short interest rate (Just to make it easy  for your autist brains):

shorts/(shorts   + float) = 0.55 ‚Üí 0.45/0.55 shorts = float  -> 0.81 shorts = float   ‚Üí  shorts = 1/0.81 float = 1.23 float or 123% of float.

[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)

...in   addition you have to keep in mind, big players always have taken fines   and trials into consideration as costs. I don‚Äôt know what the fines  for  misinformation regarding number of shorted stocks are, but if you  are  scared to death you should:

First   of all, not show it to your retarded smooth brained enemies by   recruiting bot armies, obviously lying, silver bullshit, other FUD,   ...you name it.

AND you are   willing to take any risk to survive. ...or fines   ...in this kind of   situation probably any kind of fines no matter what.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But  why would they do this? Whats their business with the Hfs? You ask  yourself? You guys are threatening soooo many business models in   finance. And this is the real **game changer**!

Keep   in mind: On stock markets you mainly trade the future. You have to  make  scenarios for the upcoming future. And there is a horrifying  scenario  for boomer financial services arising at the horizon. But  first let‚Äôs  bring it to the crucial point first:

Look for **information asymmetries**,   google it or whatever‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about in the end. That‚Äôs   the main reason why big players make shit tons of money from small   players. It‚Äôs all about information sovereignty. Or the information   monopoly‚Ä¶ however you call it. The one who is (quicker) capable to   gather more accurate information and hide it from others, wins. Like   buying your investment decisions and order limits from RobinHood.   Sometimes it‚Äôs even enough to convince your enemy that you are in   possession of better information. (By the way, this fight about   information sovereignty is exactly what you can observe right now. HFs   try to convince you retards that they have better and more accurate   information about the whole situation.)

So, lets come back to the bullet point:

Imagine   a huge crowd of people on social platforms gathering more and more   accurate information and take investment decisions on that. Because of   declining information asymmetries constantly draining money out of it.   This will drastically change the current state of the market in means of   clients to financial service provider relations. Making it a more   liberated, fairer market in some kind. ...the whole industry would lose   trillions in the future. So yeah, you guys did it. You scared a big   chunk of the whole financial sector.  Not with GME in particular but with this way of investing.   Therefore from the financial industries point of view this transition  process MUST be stopped and delayed at any cost. This is literally the  clusterfuck for boomer financial services! And the worldwide media and   wsb are the battlegrounds right now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But   hey, I‚Äôm just a short minded, stock loving retard, having a lot of fun  on this! GME to the moon! Planing to buy some dips today because I‚Äôm  way  to autistic to feel anxious about ridiculous 100 stocks short  ladder  ping pong.

But you ask but why would I sell GME for BBBY?

The stock just get cheaper and that the short still needs to buy back shares to close their positions.

Remember RC said nothing and the stock still goes up, the play is a stock squeeze play all the time.

RC sold when the stock is climbing and it didn't made a dent to the rise. 

It begins to fall only the report of his intention to sell comes out.

Short interest is still high yesterday even when he sold all of his stake. So buying a heavy shorted stock is likely gonna net profit.

TLDR: RC is likely gonna rug pull when shit goes under for GME so sell while you still can. 

There is also possibility for BBBY to go way up due to heavy buying from short covering.

ldpjo4,2021-02-06 04:09:13,Numbers don't lie. If you look at who made money then you need to consider that this whole GME thing was probably engineered by hedge funds (Citadel & SAC) to suck in retail. Retail short squeezing a hedge fund was the only narrative that could have allowed them to sell GME for $300.,"Citadel has access to Robinhood's order flow, their whole business model is to front run you, so what are the chances that a short squeeze flies under their radar? After the ""squeeze"" Melvin received fresh capital, they never got squeezed. WSB lost money. This was probably a set up by SAC & Citadel to squeeze retail with GME. While everyone here was going all in hoping to stick it to Wall street someone else was unloading worthless GME shares for $300. Then they continued from $300 down to $50 while WSB was being advised to hold with diamond hands or to buy more, adding even more liquidity for whoever was exiting.

In the end you guys became famous and lost money, while hedge funds made money but were *humiliated*.

Edit: Till this morning accounts with less than 1500 couldn't comment, now they can suddenly comment again since I posted this and another post about extreme silver positioning. **This subreddit is captured by hedge funds, the SEC needs to investigate admins and all reddit logs about the activity here.

The stock will pop so high all will make a killing but no stock crash and many will not get burnt. For example, this pandemic knocked down a lot of stocks that will go back up very soon. Why not force them back up now before the Wallstreet jumps onboard and when they do, the stock will pop higher. That is how you play it smart with this much power so no one gets burnt.

CCL was previously above $60. It is at $20. Many Wallstreet investors jumped ship in 2020 waiting for a reversal and will be back. Beat them to the punch. The cruise ship has enough funds to avoid bankruptcy, has high demand and will start sailing at the end of May. Which means the stock will start popping. We don't wait, we jump aboard, push the price up to a reasonable level BUT below the prior highs. Then wallstreet jumps in which they will again, they will push it to its fundamental highs. While we walk away with profits. When the market corrects, hold.

There's a fireside chat this Thursday where they lay out their EV strategy but here's why I'm in safe calls

1. Ford outsells NIO and TSLA byyy farrrr!
2. Partnership with Rivian isn't forgotten and a team committed for a futuristic EV design (more people like how the All-Electric Ford F150 looked compared to the Tesla Cybertruck (and won it in a tug-of-war battle recently) 
3. GM is trading at more than 4x the price of F (buying Nikola and faking a EV Hummer video)
4. Back in 2014, the Ford navigation was using $MSFT Cortana's voice for their entertainment / engagement. I'm sure $MSFT wanted to partner with Ford but had to settle something like $GM because it was already talking with $GOOG (which has most chance of creating driverless cars).
5.  Ford unlocked it's CANbus that year and let developers go to town with their apps. For a moment their cars were used by $UBER and some private researchers in their driverless fleet

ysrao5,2022-11-12 00:02:18,You‚Äôre all a bunch of sheep,"*Short term noise*

A stock falls 5% and everyone screams to buy the dip like a Tostitos salesman, but during a bear market everyone thinks the world is ending. $TSLA has fallen ~50% from ath mostly due to raising rates and all that shit but more recently the blue bird and Elon selling shares to feed the bird. 

The twitter purchase is annoying to me for 3 reasons. It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and it‚Äôs causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, it‚Äôs short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. 

Elon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe it‚Äôs stress maybe he‚Äôs actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, I‚Äôll leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if that‚Äôs actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my personal opinion, I think Elon is important to the company. I understand why some disagree, but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm debating here. 

*‚ÄùDD‚Äù*

Tesla recently hit a PE of 56 with a forward PE of 35. Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. 

So Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I‚Äôm sure some of you could say otherwise. 

Tesla is a car company, but it‚Äôs also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers. VW CEO stated the model 3 is made 3x faster than their more efficient factory. The MIC vehicles are sold at ~30% margin, recently dropped to about ~27% to meet Chinese incentives. That‚Äôs ~20% higher than the industrial average *for ICE vehicles* which have higher margins than EV in general for legacy auto. In the US they are ~15% higher than the industry average. They have next to no debt, no dealership model, mobile service which depending on the state is very good or very bad but eventually it will be very good everywhere. If you look at Tesla without the name and not knowing what they sell they don‚Äôt look like a car maker. 

People love to talk about build quality. Clearly it‚Äôs not effecting sales but regardless it‚Äôs getting better and it‚Äôs actually good in China. And if you think this is a non fixable issues you‚Äôre delusional, it‚Äôs just not a priority. Cars are still selling, as soon as this changes it will become a priority. 

Cheap interior is cheap in cost, and far from ‚Äúluxury‚Äù but it‚Äôs durable and practical. For $50k it‚Äôs understandable why not everyone loves it, and why some think it‚Äôs unacceptable. Not a real issue imo, if it starts reflecting in a loss of sales (after demand drops blow supply) they can easily add some leather and drop margins to make everyone happy again. I don‚Äôt see demand dropping below supply longterm anytime soon, especially with cheaper models being announced. 

Ford has only had earnings 1 of 3 quarters this year Q2 667m. Forward PE of 7.4, a mountain of debt, transitioning into a new manufacturing process while also scaling down another, low margins, but they are scaling EV production well. Aiming to hit 600k run-rate by 2023. 

VW has also put in serious work and has expanded quickly but their numbers are easy to get confused as they tend to combine hybrid and EV sales. They‚Äôre earnings have shrunk every quarter of this year. PE and forward of ~5. Selling 366k in the last 9 months, so we‚Äôll assume 500k for the year and growth is ~25% Y/Y. 

Tesla can pay off debt with 1/4th of its cash on hand, has industry leading margins 15-20% higher than industry average, and are aiming to grow production at ~50% over the next couple years which they are on track to do. ‚ÄúSome years will be a little less some will be a little more.‚Äù Giga Shanghai, one of four Giga factories has a run-rate of 1 million alone. 

So the best US manufacturers are shrinking while Tesla is growing production and earnings at ~50% and ~100%. Yet Tesla is trading at ~5x industry av, remember what happened last time we saw economic downturn like this legacy did not do well. 

The economy is not doing great regardless of what the ice cream man says. Less people will be buying shit they don‚Äôt need, but generally luxury items perform better than regular consumer goods. The people that were stretching to afford a $50k+ car probably won‚Äôt be buying in these climates. But someone that had no issue buying will still be buying. Even if it‚Äôs worse than we thought and way less people are buying cars, who‚Äôs going to last longer, a shrinking non profitable legacy auto company or a small lean extremely profitable Tesla? Obviously tesla will perform better in those climates.

China is a threat to domination, not success. BYD has officially passed tesla in overall sales, and are doing extremely well. They‚Äôre moving into Europe, I don‚Äôt see them moving to North American markets soon. It‚Äôs very easy to do EVs in China thanks to the CCP, and they‚Äôre growing extremely fast due to soft regulations and a huge market. I think at least BYD will be a major player longterm and possibly NIO. I‚Äôd buy their stock if they weren‚Äôt IOUs from the CCP. 

I haven‚Äôt even touched on their energy business which is growing well and has a new factory ramping, I didn‚Äôt include  FSD because it‚Äôs not close to being solved but I strongly believe Tesla has set themselves up the best to do it, and I don‚Äôt consider the sex bot for multiple reasons. Regardless of not including them any one of these has the potential to be worth more than the car business. 

Thanks for listening to my TED talk, ik reading is hard. Oh and sorry my bad üò©üöÄüöÄüìà

TLDR: Tesla has so much room to grow longterm, with a forward PE of only 35 I strongly believe it has upside potential even in these market conditions.

rnv04d,2021-12-24 21:12:42,Best EV play - Bullish as F ‚Ä¶.. MB-private analyst: 12/24/21. EV auto market Future projection.,"If I were a TESLA investor... though I'm not.... I would be very concerned and WORRIED about one BASIC and KEY metric, the valuation of the company based on forward earnings. 

Imagine an objective analysis 10 years in the future:

An objective analysis 10 years in the future will acknowledge that TESLA investors believed that it was reasonable to buy TESLA stock with a valuation of 100 or so times of forward earnings... and expected it to continue to climb in value ... despite all evidence that the ENTIRE global automotive sector was about to jump into EV production... ready to compete with TESLA for market share, some with subsidy support from their own governments. Those future analysts will be very, very puzzled and ask the question: ""What were they thinking?"" TESLA is, now, at its apex because it owned the EV market. However, it is clear that conditions will change dramatically and rapidly in the coming year when ACTUAL consumer choices are possible based on comparisons of a great variety of EV models. We have yet to see the coming competition in daily traffic. That day is coming for TESLA. Typical consumers are risk-averse and value-conscious. We all don't drive the very best and most expensive cars... we drive what we need at the best value. Competition in TESLA's space will be massive, brutal, and ugly. It is understandable that TESLA can only lose market share over time. There's evidence that this is NOW happening because of Ford's entry into EV production.

Ford is currently valued at just about 10 times of forward earnings. Ford is UNDER-VALUED with ENORMOUS POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH. Those same future analysts ten years from now will ask quizically: ""How could a reasonable and well-informed investor back then choose TESLA over Ford? It was obvious that Ford was the much better value.""",0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rnv04d/best_ev_play_bullish_as_f_mbprivate_analyst/,wallstreetbets

qly6ze,2021-11-03 16:26:55,All in on Meta,"I‚Äôll cut to the chase. I‚Äôm all in on meta. Here is why:

Firstly, Meta is outrageously undervalued in its current state. I don‚Äôt care if they use ‚Äúunethical‚Äù targeted ads. Use your data to sell me things. I watched the entire whistleblower hearing and it was silly. Not only was she unable to provide specific documents, but her strongest argument was ‚Äúfacebook bad because it makes people feel bad. Government help plz‚Äù. The government was like ‚Äúyes this is a grave matter indeed.‚Äù They won‚Äôt do anything. The public will stop caring. In a month this will blow over into the dustbin of facebook‚Äôs reputation and the stock will naturally ascend back to the p/e they deserve. If you give them a p/e of 30. The stock will sit right around $400 (current p/e 23).

But that‚Äôs the boring shit. I really don‚Äôt care about that. After all, I‚Äôm ALL IN on this company. The metaverse is not a silly sci-fi idea. It‚Äôs going to be real very soon, it will accelerate faster than you can imagine, and it will replace reality as you know it. I‚Äôm about to explain exactly where this is going in the near future and the distant future. This is going to sound very dystopian, which I agree with, but I‚Äôm not in the stock market to be moral.

**The VR explosion:** It‚Äôs already happening and it‚Äôs accelerating. 4 years ago, VR was a silly thing. Maybe you had one friend with a headset and they had like a few games or whatever. 2 years ago VR was a niche market. With the release of the Oculus quest 1, more people could afford and choose to purchase a headset. But with the quest 2 and the way things are playing out today, many of my friends have VR. And owning a VR headset is no longer a crazy thing and it‚Äôs starting to become the norm. In 2020 steam VR saw an increase in user base by 30% and an increase in revenue by 71%. The oculus quest 2 has sold 8 million destroying the sales of the quest 1 by a nearly 700% increase. If this trend is set to continue. The next VR release from Meta, Project Cambria, will sell 700% of 8 million which would be 56 million headsets by 2023.

**VR technology is growing exponentially:** VR and especially AR is predicated on the ability to fit powerful computers inside of small spaces. Applying Moore‚Äôs law to the computer chip. It‚Äôs been a well observed reality that computing power doubles every year. Meaning you can fit twice the amount of processing power within the same volume every year. Think about that- *All computing progress developed by humanity over the course if it‚Äôs lifetime is doubled YEARLY.* The development of face and eye tracking is set to be released on a consumer priced Meta VR headset in mid 2022. Visuals are approaching human eye resolution, and VR is still in its infancy.

Okay, enough about current data. Where is this really going? I‚Äôm not sold on it, it seems kinda dumb.

**The crazy shit:** The metaverse is not the successor to the internet, it‚Äôs the successor to reality. Within the decade we will see the metaverse really take shape, then you‚Äôll begin to see the vision of where this is going with your own eyes. But if you want a preview, I‚Äôll show you.

1. The metaverse will be an exponential self-sustaining economy that will surpass the GDP of the entire world. Think of transactions in the metaverse for gaming, like CSGO skins. The skins are represented as NFTs. And are traded on the market. Your skins aren‚Äôt just for your game though. The metaverse is all connected, and you can take your CSGO skin and use it as an item in another game. You can take your genji skin and go to a concert. At the concert the person might sell T-shirts specific to that event which are also represented as NFTs. Businesses will begin to pop up in the metaverse. I already have several ideas, but will not be disclosing them here. Once people realize how easy it is to make money in the metaverse, much like the internet, there will be a mass migration. A gold rush like you‚Äôve never seen. I could easily see another dot-com bubble level of excitement. The economy will rapidly grow. And as the metaverse becomes more and more real, it will only accelerate that growth. As more people join the metaverse, more major companies will need to change their business model to enter the metaverse in order to survive. Which will be a feedback loop that grows to unimaginable heights. If you want to get rich, be an early metaverse adopter and start a company that sells a service or product specifically useful for the metaverse. The real economy will transition more and more to the virtual and there will come a day before 2040 when the GDP of the metaverse surpasses that of the real world. And it won‚Äôt stop there. Whoever runs the metaverse will have an economy larger than the entire world under their thumb.
2. What Meta won‚Äôt tell you about the metaverse: By the time you‚Äôve normalized living in the metaverse, you better not care about privacy anymore. I believe the idea of privacy will ultimately be discarded as the price of living.  In your headset, Meta will track your eye movements, your facial expressions, the way your body physically responds to the sensory input of the virtual world. Whether you like it or not, you are a predictable genetic algorithm. And when billions of data points about your response to input are measured, Meta will be able to build an artificial model of your expected output and know what you want before you want it. You might think, wow that‚Äôs scary and really good for targeted advertising. And you‚Äôd be right. But that‚Äôs just the beginning.
   1. Further future- 2030-2050: Once your being is analyzed as a data model (By an AI like a more powerful version of youtube recommended). At this point in time, AI has reached unprecedented capabilities. AI will build entire worlds for you, filled with things it knows you will enjoy, things you‚Äôll want to buy, experiences you‚Äôll want to have. A world far more interesting and exciting than the real one, tailored specifically to you.
   2. But your data will construct something even more bizarre. AI NPCs. Your best friends won‚Äôt be homo sapiens. They‚Äôll be AI indistinguishable from real people. Perhaps even alive themselves. Generated based on the data of your predictable personality model. Your true love. Someone literally perfect for you, will be an AI. And it will be incredible. You might think, *that‚Äôs stupid this is stupid I‚Äôm never going to fall in love with an AI*. You are wrong. And when you‚Äôre there and the entity is in front of you in the virtual world. When you can touch them, and they can express emotion to you, you will understand. Your utopia is coming.
3. The metaverse will change what it means to be human. It will redefine our understanding of humanity and even gender. In the virtual world, there is no need to be a human. Your avatar can be an animal, a robot, an amoeba, an anime character, literally anything. People will soon feel better represented by your avatar than your real self. And as we cross that threshold the real world will seem more and more lack luster. The real world becomes a boring place where you have to live with this boring body that has to obey the laws of physics. This will further push the transition to the virtual world.
4. The transition from sedentary VR living to immortal consciousness. As people realize how incredible it is to live in the metaverse, the race for immortality will break out more powerfully than the space race. What is the race for immortality? It means to exist as pure data. To upload your consciousness into the metaverse directly, to abandon your feeble human body and live forever exploring the virtual world filled with real people and AI. The ever changing and evolving economy and ecosystem. To travel from universe as you please. If Meta is a part of this transition, then they will own the platform on which your mind exists. They will literally own your body in a sense. Privacy will be so far gone that it‚Äôs a wistful wish of the past, nor will you likely care. Meta will see everything, will know everything you are, everything you could ever want. And they will sell it to you.
5. The Fermi paradox: where are all the aliens? If there are so many worlds capable of supporting life, if there are quadrillions of planets in the galaxy. If they‚Äôve had billions of years to evolve, why don‚Äôt we see signs of intelligent life in the universe? Why are we alone out here? It‚Äôs not that intelligent life inherently drives itself to extinction. I highly doubt it‚Äôs that intelligent life is so absurdly rare that we are the only ones. The solution to the Fermi paradox is that there is no reason to ever travel beyond the solar system. A civilization capable of interstellar travel is capable of creating its own universe- unbound by the laws of physics and the vast distances between the stars. A civilization that can shape reality like gods through the virtual world. To exist as pure data consciousness in a network of supercomputers. Humanity will never travel beyond the solar system, not because we will go extinct, but because we will never need to.

Meta is a company paving the way to redefine the human species, to redefine existence, and to redefine our future. Meta will own the platform upon which our lives exist. This world is terrifying, strange, unbelievable, but also inevitable. And it will be beautiful. It may sound dystopian, but it is, in fact, the opposite. To exist as pure data in the metaverse is the end of death. It is the end of hunger. It is the end of humanity as we know it. On October 28th, 2021, Facebook changed its name to Meta and announced itself as a company fully dedicated to the metaverse. A day that will go in the history books as a turning point and the beginning of the new age. The world is changing, and it will only change more and more rapidly. The end is approaching, and so is the beginning. And I‚Äôm ready to be a part of it.

EDIT:

tl;dr: 

\-VR is exploding exponentially

\-Meta is fundamentally undervalued right now even just as FB with out VR

\-Computing power is progressing exponentially which will enable absurd VR potential

\-A separate metaverse economy will explode like the gold rush and snowball to overtake the GDP of the real world over the next several decades

\-VR headsets will take your data and render and AI that can sell you things you didn't know you wanted

\-You will fall in love with an AI generated from your data consciousness model

mwt602,2021-04-23 11:30:11,$SKLZ on April 23rd,"$SKLZ stock hit a high of $46.30 and currently sits in the $16‚Äôs. In the last two days, Cathie Wood added over 6 million shares across ARKK and ARKW, her biggest purchase by far. Technically speaking, SKLZ looks to be in a reversal path and the risk reward scenario is highly favorable. This company can honestly grow in huge multiples in the next 5 years and beyond. I see the price here being over $200 by end of 2023. 

DD:

1. SKLZ has 95% profit margins. Yes.... NINETY FIVE %. Although they are not profitable yet (they reinvest all profits into marketing efforts for growth), when they do become profitable, expected in 2022, the profits will grow wildly. They are debt free and have 600 million on their balance sheet however. 

2. SKLZ is a platform provider for betting between users who play Mobile games, the fastest growing gaming market. Think of SKLZ as the Shopify of gaming. $SHOP provides a platform to small e-commerce outfits whereas SKLZ provides a platform to the small game developers. SHOP was $10/share just 5 years ago. The mobile market is expected to double in the next 4 years. 

3. The US is only 10% of the worlds mobile gaming market, and SKLZ is in process of expanding to India this year. They have included the costs of India expansion into projections, but none of the projected revenues. India is a larger market and growing at a much faster rate. This could literally double revenues by next year. 

4. The CEO (Andrew Paradise) has stated as recently as yesterday that his company aims to ‚Äúgamify‚Äù exercise, education, etc. He brought up what a Peloton partnership would look like in a Fool interview yesterday. Essentially, people would verse each other on their bikes. This would make it more fun and add a betting element. This partnership would be HUGE. 

5. SKLZ already has a partnership with the NFL for a developer to make a football-themed SKLZ app this year. They can easily make partnerships with the remaining sports organizations. SKLZ also intends to expand into first person shooters and racing games this year.

Despite what many people who have a vested interest in this succeeding are telling you, a price increase to 800$ is not **certain.** A lot of shorts have already been and are being covered right now. The volume yesterday and today combined is the same as the total float. This is huge. The volume on Wednesday was 71mil., which is bigger than the actual float. While I am sure that the short interest right now is still very high, because this seems like free money to most hedgefunds a further price increase is not certain at all at these levels. Im confident that 90% of shares shorted at 40-90$ have already been squeezed out, causing the massive price increases to $340. The only way another short squeeze happens is if some insitution decides to make it happen by playing the long side and squeezing out the shares reshorted at 200-300$, but this would be very hard, since the price is already so high. Not impossible but NOT CERTAIN. Despite all the hivemind shit you hear on this sub. YOU NEED TO CONTROL YOUR RISK and if you're betting a large part of your life on this succeeding you should sell gme until movement in the stock doesnt dictate your financial security. Retailers are not driving the price anyway, so dont lose your life savings and go into debt because you saw a ""apes together strong"" meme or some dumb shit.  


The most ironic shit is that if you follow wsb advice you can never win because even if a squeeze happens, the posts here will tell you that ""its not the real squeeze, hold dont sell"", so you can never actually profit from it by selling to the shorts that need to cover. Selling to them is left up to some smart retailers and mainly the institutions that are playing the long game on this. Don't help them, HELP YOURSELF. CONTROL YOUR RISK. HAVE FUN BUT MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS DUMB AS FUCK.

TLDR: Another squeeze might happen but not certain. Make sure you know that, even if you wouldnt get this impression by browsing this sub. Don't bet your financial security on this.

kahtqa,2020-12-10 15:58:48,The Next PLTR - C3.ai (AI),"I'll make this short and sweet. 

AI is used for making more accurate predictions. If you can make more accurate predictions, you can fucking mint money. What if you could automatically know how much to price a airline ticket to sell out every single time, down to a penny. How about know exactly how many pairs of size 6 leggings you need to make this quarter down to within 0.25%. How about exactly what ads to show someone to maximize dollars spent on Instagram every year. This is what is happening billions times a day behind the scenes. 

&#x200B;

[C3.ai](https://C3.ai) brings the power that has brought AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, and FB to the rest of enterprise. AI models are difficult to deploy, tweak, and manage. This shit is brand new, there is very little talent. [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) helps companies implement AI into their business through their full featured platform. 

&#x200B;

When you are looking for good software you want to find something that is defensible / complex, yet easy to implement, and obviously valuable to the end user. The reason ServiceNow can charge JP Morgan 60 million dollars a year is because it saves them 500. For C3, deploying these models is easy because they have pre-builts that they can adapt to any business, a platform to run them on, is cloud agnostic, and the internal talent that even medium organizations wouldn't be able to find / use effectively. A single AI implementation can be worth 10s, 100s of millions of dollars to an organization, and you don't think they will be happy to pay [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) through the nose to maintain it? AI capability will be table stakes in 2 years, if it isn't already. This is a pure-play on that. Look at the post IPO pop.

msy7zx,2021-04-17 20:17:06,Extremely thorough CLOV recent action DD,"I‚Äôm going to go back a little bit in time and tell you how CLOV was directly related to GME squeeze.
So when GME was squeezing two very influential people have backed the squeeze and caused it to squeeze even more. Those two people were Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya. Both partners in previous endeavors and friends. 
GME squeeze hurt short seller Hindenburg so much that they have lost 40% of their account that week. 
CLOV is backed by Chamath Palihapitiya. Hindenburg, in order to retaliate at Chamath for causing them huge losses, published a short seller report for CLOV few days after Chamath tweeted about GME. Short seller report had very little base, yet that caused the stock to drop and also SEC had to initiate an investigation due to the claims. 
Since then stock got beaten down to less than IPO prices. What does that mean? It means that it was moved not so much by true owners of the stock, but mostly by short sellers. That will play in nicely in the squeeze because short sellers always have to close out, but if stock is still held by their true purchasers it means that there are even less shares available for active trading. 



Enough of history. Retail following:

Since GME endeavor Chamath PAlihapitiya joined the club of ‚Äúretail gods‚Äù.... he is one of the poster babies for retail movement on hurting short sellers. His previous partnerships with Elon Musk furthers retail following so now not only we have GME crowd supporting Chamath, but also Tesla crowd. Both of those stocks were some of the most successful trades in history. 



Friday‚Äôs Hindenburg‚Äôs fright with CLOV:

On Friday CLOV has opened with 148% short interest and after this was noticed by retail the squeeze has started. The volume topped 250M shares traded (10x average daily volume and 5x its previous heaviest volume day). (Ill get in to more technicals later, but needed to mention this to push the narrative).
Hindenburg saw the action and protecting their possible short position tweeted that FactSet has misleading short interest data about CLOV not including CEOs clad B shares in the float. 
FactSet came back to Hindenburg‚Äôs allegations with a reply that CEOs type B shares are classified as not tradable and are not included in the float. And once again confirmed that stock is 148% short.
This further angered retail traders and a lot of chatter online has started how Hindenburg is trying to manipulate this stock with lies and deceit. 
A lot of people didn‚Äôt catch on on Friday but through the night and this afternoon Reddit and stock twits seem to have exploded about it, videos are popping up on YouTube. A lot of traction is being created over the weekend for a sweet Monday open. 



Technicals:
*CLOV free float is 109mil 
*CLOV shares outstanding are 406mil
*78% of CLOV shares are owed by insiders and are still locked up. Insiders are only allowed to sell if stock hits $30 and stays above $30 for 90 days 
*institutional ownership of CLOV is at 48%

*the volume on Friday was 249mil shares which only represents 61% turn over for shares outstanding, but if you take locked up shares out of consideration, true turn over was actually 228%, meaning every share available to trade was bought and sold at least twice on Friday. 

A lot of people that bought on Friday (including NEXT financial group that bought 21,400 shares) will not likely be actively trading this week meaning available shares short term will continue on decreasing.

In my speculation out of 109 mil free float Only around 35% of shares will be available to trade this week. Here is how I got to this number: 
-institutions owe 48% of stock and they are not likely to trade short term fluctuations, but giving it a benefit of doubt let‚Äôs say that institutions that will hold account only to 30% of float. Now we only have 70% of float left to trade....
-let‚Äôs assume that investors that owe CLOV long term account for 20% of the float. A lot of them don‚Äôt check stocks daily or sometimes even weekly. Let‚Äôs assume that half of them even won‚Äôt notice what is happening this week. At this point we only have 50% of float left to trade. 
-the rest of the free float is being traded by scalpers/ day traders, swing traders and ‚Äúdiamond handers‚Äù. This is a very educated group and unless scalping or pattern trading will understand that we are in the middle of the squeeze and hold. I believe this group will contribute to another 15% of float being unavailable, assuming half of them will be trading fluctuations and half holding. 
So my conclusion is: only 35% of available shares will be circulating next week being sold and bought over and over again. That‚Äôs only 38mil shares not being stuck in someone‚Äôs account semi permanently. Some more liquidity will be provided short term by other shorters flocking in, but I won‚Äôt take them in consideration because they too have to close out at some point. 

Fallowing all this speculative, yet very carefully vetted math let‚Äôs calculate the demand for the shares, just to close short positions
-148% of the free float is shorted, meaning 161mil shares will be in demand just to close out short positions. Since we already established that there will be only 38mil shares freely circulating in the market each short share will only have 0.24 shares. So looks like there are 4 times less shares than demand to close short positions! Throw in some buying activity to that math and you have a number closer to 10:1. 

Following all of that the question is how far the stock can go during this particular squeeze? Well the answer is: it‚Äôs mathematically impossible to calculate. Although there are some indicators of what people can expect. Smaller the float, the bigger the short interest and the heavier the volume the further it can go. In this particular instance we have the combination of all three factors. Even if it‚Äôs impossible to predict exactly what price short squeeze will hit, it‚Äôs possible to trade short squeeze well using technical indicators and trade management. Monitoring volume, daily short interest and days to cover should be adequate. To know when short squeeze is ending I monitor same indicators that made me spot the short squeeze to start with, but in reverse. Meaning volume will start to tapper off, short percentage decrease and the upwards momentum will start to whilt. I also watch out for extremely sudden, needle like falls (trailing stop loss domino effect). 

I hope the read was interesting and I haven‚Äôt lost you half way through. 

I won‚Äôt go into any CLOV fundamentals or any of that good stuff cause I think we already established that everything is in order there. It is also completely irrelevant in a mathematical squeeze.",457,0.62,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msy7zx/extremely_thorough_clov_recent_action_dd/,wallstreetbets

https://i.redd.it/7m7dix6tdric1.gif

Berkshire Hathaway's recent request for confidential treatment from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the purchase of undisclosed stock(s) has sparked speculation. This move, aimed at concealing specific investments from public knowledge, suggests a strategic play by CEO Warren Buffett to continue acquiring shares without influencing the stock price. Such tactics allow Berkshire to amass significant positions at lower costs, given that any disclosed investment by Berkshire often leads to a surge in the stock's price as investors rush to emulate Buffett's moves. This scenario unfolds as Berkshire Hathaway navigates the complexities of the current financial landscape, leveraging its considerable influence and capital to optimize its investment strategy.

I have a theory that the secret accumulation of Tesla shares by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, if true, could represent a significant shift in Buffett's investment strategy, recognizing the tech and automotive sectors' transformative potential. This move could symbolize a meeting of minds between Buffett and Elon Musk, particularly with Musk's engagement in the Giving Pledge, initiated by Buffett. The potential synergy could redefine investment philosophies toward tech enterprises and forecast the impact of autonomous driving on the insurance industry, notably affecting Berkshire's Geico. This theory suggests a future where Musk's tech innovation and Buffett's investment savvy might reshape the automotive and insurance landscapes, especially in auto insurance risk management in the autonomous vehicle era.

I wouldn't put it past Buffett's team to be running a secretly coordinated campaign to negatively impact Tesla's narrative and share price. The coordinated stories of recalls that are merely software updates could be one example of this strategy. This approach would not only serve to depress Tesla's stock price, allowing Berkshire Hathaway to accumulate a more significant share at a lower cost but also exemplify the lengths to which Buffett's team might go to secure a strategic advantage in the market. This calculated move would underscore the depth of strategy employed by Berkshire Hathaway, manipulating market perceptions to favor their investment goals.",0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1argk38/is_berkshire_hathaways_hidden_mystery_stock/,wallstreetbets

q6t56l,2021-10-12 19:00:34,$IRNT only this week. Out of the picture next week.,"IRNT Gamma potential this week but only this week. 3.4 mil OI on super low float of available shares at 4 mil at the $15 strike all expiry on 10/15. Basically looking at 100% covering if it holds $13 which would 3-5x the price (again) because the open interest supersedes the amount of shares available, which puts it in contention for an infinite squeeze. 500% cost to borrow.. highest in the whole market. I don't think I've ever seen a stock be negative for this many consecutive days without a rebound. Seems shady. I always wanted to achieve the opposite of a short ladder attack, which is **the bulldoze attack**.

**Guide to setting up high frequency trading on WSB:** On any low float stock, if a large group of buyers, purchase 1 share per order and repeats that 50-100 times, we could utilize our version of high frequency trading to raise the price of a stock. The reverse would be a short ladder tactic to regress the price with high frequency selling. This would essentially be it's counter. The caveat is Robinhood, and using their payment for order flow utilization to game the system in our favor. (Ever wonder why when you submit an order to buy anything on robinhood at market price (without setting a limit $ value) your immediately negative once the order is filled?) It's because there is an intermediary using your bid to buy at the lowest offer from a seller first.. just before re-selling it to you after at a slightly higher premium price per share (skimming). Instead of getting the best price at market value at the time of your order in good faith, you have a sleazy middleman milking you for every share. And we buy in the thousands so skimming .0023 on 4500 shares is still a cost of $10.35 to us, under the guise of ""free trading utopia for all"". (Yes, there is an investigation on going currently into Robinhood about this, so let's bury our head in the sand and keep our fingers crossed) Anyway, we could instead leverage this 3rd party to essentially be upping the price for us on every buy order we submit at market value because... each buy request we submit is automatically doubled in frequency with the price slightly increasing per order filled... This would essentially be our manual version of using high frequency trading to level the playing field on low volume / volatile stocks. I have experimented this on $KMPH a low float stock with a few friends and have seen the movement like clockwork but it required us buying 5 shares per order, non-stop at market value without setting a purchase price $ limit (did this about 100 times repeatedly). This only works in the time of WSB because we have strength in numbers and community sentiment during this state of constant battle with coordinated hedgefund attacks on meme rallies. So our focus should shift to optimizing the community buying strategy and develop counter strategies to the tactics used to dismantle stocks mid rally.

In summary: **This is a low float stock, remarkably easy to rally, with a sharp catalyst this particular week to 3x it.**

I think this the type of swing trade folks here have a taste for. I see DD's on $CRSR, about it's long-term deep future projections and touting a low float of 36.32 million. This one has 4 million... Running a stock that trades 1 mil volume per day is much easier achieved than even the current squeezes in play like $PROG (26.44 million float) or $SOFI (614 million float).

To be noted: I don't mind punishing market makers (aka hedgefunds) for greedily overextending their risk on a derivative trade by offering calls exceeding the share count of the stock. Poor risk management has it's consequences.

Most Likely: **$16**

Likely: **$22**

If everything goes right: **$30**

If it matches it's previous squeeze: **$60**

If it goes to the moon: **$108**

&#x200B;

**UPDATE:** **As you can see the action I'm referring to today, hedgefunds have been deploying coordinated attacks on all meme rallies causing losses to wsb while planting their large short positions collectively beforehand. Tad bit of collusion at play.  The notable recent ones have been: DATS, CEI, SPCE, ATER, SOFI, PROG, SDC.**

IRNT would be a firm rebuttal since 90% of the shares are subject to lockup until Feb 2022, so there are very limited ways to suppress a rally.  DATS today was a coordinated short ladder attack by multiple hedgefunds using high frequency trading algorithms because their float is still 12.25 million and furthermore potentially susceptible to dilution by a share offering with their price action. These are the worries avoided with IRNT.

""That said, most of the company's 84.4 million outstanding common shares following the recent business combination remain subject to lock-up agreements (emphasis added by author):Pursuant to lock-up agreements (the ‚ÄúLock-Up Agreement‚Äù) entered into prior to the consummation of the Business Combination by and among LGL and certain stockholders and employees of Legacy IronNet signatories thereto, including Legacy IronNet‚Äôs executive officers, directors and 5% stockholders (the ‚ÄúLegacy IronNet Lock-Up Parties‚Äù), who held in the aggregate approximately 66 million shares of our common stock as of the consummation of the Business Combination, the Legacy IronNet Lock-Up Parties have agreed that, with respect to our common stock, through the date that is 180 days after the closing of the Business Combination, and, with respect to the Warrants and any of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of Warrants, through the date that is 30 days after the closing of the Business Combination (...).**The majority of the currently locked-up shares will become available for sale on February 27, 2022.""**

j8shnw,2020-10-10 21:16:21,Tesla calls bought me a tesla...,"It was a cold January morning. Tesla was up about 15% in the past few days. I hadn‚Äôt bought the stock before, but was intrigued by the business model and being an investing rookie, I felt some FOMO. I bought 2 shares. A few weeks later I sold out at a $400 dollar profit. If only I had known them what I know now... little did I know, that this quick little stock flip would be the beginning of the next chapter of my life.

I repeated the process a few times until the corona dip. At this point I had consistent $ coming in from an ECom business I was running. I put it ALL IN TESLA. The rest of my portfolio has tanked but when Tesla turned around, it brought the whole thing back upwards. I was hooked. Elon had won me over. I was officially a Tesla tard.

Then, in June, I discovered options üòà. I made had a few losses and a few wins. Notably, a Spotify option play that made me around 15k. I made a mistake and sold a call on Tesla right before a run up. It was exercised. Even though I didn‚Äôt lose money, I was heartbroken. My position in Tesla was cut in half. 

While I could just buy back in at a higher price, I decided to make a BIG BET. I was confident on Tesla in the long term and I had about $97,000 in cash in my account from the call being exercised. I went ALL in on a Tesla 9/18 call. The very next day, the stock rifled up giving me a 50k profit on the day.

If investing into stocks was like cocaine, I had now found crack. And god I loved it. A few more large options plays later, and I decided to give a little bit back to the one responsible for my success. So, at the ripe old age of 18, I decided to buy a Tesla Model 3. Thanks Elon.

The only exception to this rule are meme stocks like TSLA, GME etc. AAPL is an exception too but AAPL's net revenue is quickly catching up. But ETFs and tech stock market in general are not in a bubble, you are looking at less than a handful of stocks to make this determination.

You guys are also forgetting that we are currently undergoing a technology revolution like never before. Covid-19 put technology in the forefront and it's like the invention of the steam engine right now. Everything in tech and the cyberspace in particular is literally going to skyrocket in the upcoming years. People who are going full time in right now will be the winners and history will know it. Jury is out for if these meme stocks are overvalued too because we don't know their future potential (TSLA, NIO etc - minority of the tech stocks). What is happening right now is that safe money is moving out of stocks and either into bonds or cash. Because of inflation cash is going to take a huge hit in a year or so when we finally have the figures for how much Covid-19 cost us in American dollars. So not only will people miss out on the huge gains post-tech revolution but they will also take a big hit for holding cash.

I am not going to say if I am a financial expert or not. It is common sense. But I was never a part of these PLTR, GME and TLRY ponzi schemes. These people are worse than the hedge funds because they are just as greedy but far less educated / invested. It was a pyramid scheme where the first guy in took the most gains. I don't believe in something like a store that sells physical copies of video games to ever succeed rofl. Let's not forget Gamestop offering $3 for a game they would later sell for $40. All you bozos did was bail out the assholes that were invested in an asshole company and had poor retail investors take the hit for it. You people took advantage of depressed anxious jobless individuals and now many of them are left without much. I took a big hit from TSLA too (silly me). But I do believe in the cyberspace taking off big time in the upcoming years and it'd be the most valuable resource imaginable. You are seeing news right now about tech stocks being in a bubble over and over. You are also seeing news about some bond bullshit going up. It's the news that wants you to get out so the big whales can go in cheap - right before Biden administration goes all in on the clean energy and tech sector. Tech in the 1990s was nothing like it is now. India and China did not know what computers were back then, now every person has an iphone and tiktok in their hands. Cars are running on cyberspace/cloud that did not exist back then. Revenue of tech companies dwarfes the oil giants. Currency itself is produced using technology (Cryptos). Globalism / latest tech and the cloud itself has become the most valuable resource not just in America but also in India and China which have 10x our population. Instead of going to war for oil now we are spreading peace for likes.",14,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxzyzn/tech_stocks_being_in_a_bubble_is_a_lie_dont_let/,wallstreetbets

Elon Musk‚Äôs Antics Turn Owners and Would-Be Buyers Against Tesla     

Ira Boudway and Kyle Stock           

Sat, July 30, 2022 at 9:00 AM           

(Bloomberg) -- Dennis Levitt got his first Tesla, a blue Model S, in 2013, and loved it. ‚ÄúIt was so much better than any car I've ever driven,‚Äù the 73-year-old self-storage company executive says.        

He bought into the brand as well as Elon Musk, Tesla Inc.‚Äôs charismatic chief executive officer, purchasing another Model S the following year and driving the first one across the country. In 2016, he stood in line at a showroom near his suburban Los Angeles home to be one of the first to order two Model 3s ‚Äî one for himself, the other for his wife.

‚ÄúI was a total Musk fanboy,‚Äù Levitt says.

Was, because while Levitt still loves his Teslas, he‚Äôs soured on Musk. ‚ÄúOver time, his public statements have really come to bother me,‚Äù Levitt said, citing the CEO‚Äôs spats with US President Joe Biden, among others. ‚ÄúHe acts like a seven-year-old.‚Äù

Before it was reported Musk had an affair with Sergey Brin‚Äôs wife, which he‚Äôs denied; before his slipshod deal, then no-deal, to acquire Twitter Inc.; before the revelation he fathered twins with an executive at his brain-interface startup Neuralink; before SpaceX fired employees who called him ‚Äúa frequent source of distraction and embarrassment‚Äù; before his daughter changed her name and legal gender after his history of mocking pronouns; before an article said SpaceX paid an employee $250,000 to settle a claim he sexually harassed her, allegations he‚Äôs called untrue; Musk‚Äôs behavior was putting off prospective customers and perturbing some Tesla owners.

The trends have shown up in one consumer survey and market research report after another: Tesla commands high brand awareness, consideration and loyalty, and customers are mostly delighted by its cars. Musk‚Äôs antics, on the other hand? They could do without.

Creative Strategies, a California-based customer-experience measurer, mentioned owner frustration with Musk in a study it published in April. A year earlier, research firm Escalent found Musk was the most negative aspect of the Tesla brand among electric-vehicle owners surveyed.

‚ÄúWe hear from Tesla owners who will say, ‚ÄòLook, I love my vehicle, but I really wish I didn't have to respond to my friends and family about his latest tweet,‚Äô‚Äù says Mike Dovorany, who spoke with thousands of EV owners and potential buyers during his two years working in Escalent‚Äôs automotive and mobility group.

Tesla has so far had no trouble growing its way through Musk‚Äôs many controversies. The dip in vehicle deliveries the company reported last quarter was its first sequential decline since early 2020 and largely had to do with Covid lockdowns in Shanghai forcing its most productive factory to shut for weeks. Competitors that have been chasing the company for a decade may still be years away from catching up in the EV sales ranks.

Musk‚Äôs star power, built in no small part by his activity on Twitter ‚Äî the same forum where he‚Äôs become such a lightning rod ‚Äî has contributed immensely to Tesla, especially since it‚Äôs shunned traditional advertising. His steady stream of online banter, punctuated with the occasional grandiose announcement or stunt (see: shooting a Roadster into space) keeps Tesla in the headlines. During the company‚Äôs earlier days, the trolling and glib comments were a feature, not a bug. They allowed Musk to shape media coverage and made him the ringleader for Tesla‚Äôs legion of very-online fans.

But after making Tesla and himself so synonymous with one another, Musk has waded into political conflicts, attempted to buy one of the world‚Äôs most influential social media platforms and struggled to bat back unflattering coverage of his personal life, putting the company‚Äôs increasingly valuable brand at risk.

Stay on top of the electric car revolution by signing up to our Hyperdrive newsletter here.

Jerry James Stone, a 48-year-old chef in Sacramento, California, who teaches his 219,000 YouTube channel subscribers how to make vegan and vegetarian meals, drives a Volkswagen Beetle convertible and plans to go electric with his next car. He isn‚Äôt sure yet which model, but certain it won‚Äôt be a Tesla.

‚ÄúElon has just soiled that brand for me so much that I don't even think I would take one if I won one,‚Äù Stone says. ‚ÄúYou have this guy who's the richest dude in the world, who has this huge megaphone, and he uses it to call somebody a pedophile who's not, or to fat-shame people, all these things that are just kind of gross.‚Äù

According to Strategic Vision, a US research firm that consults auto companies, some 39% of car buyers say they wouldn‚Äôt consider a Tesla. That‚Äôs not necessarily out of the ordinary ‚Äî almost half of respondents say they won‚Äôt consider German luxury brands. But Tesla does lag more mass-market brands: Toyota, for example, is only off the shopping list for 23% of drivers.

Emma Sirr, a 28-year-old worker in cloud computing who lives in Bozeman, Montana, gets around with her partner and their two dogs in a 2004 Nissan Frontier. They've been researching EVs for about three years and until recently considered Teslas the only viable option, given their range and the charging infrastructure the company has built in their area. But they refused to buy one because of Musk, their main gripes being his politics, staff turnover at the company and its cavalier approach to autonomous-driving technology.

‚ÄúWe took Tesla off the table from the get-go,‚Äù Sirr says. She and her partner have their eyes on the Kia Niro and Chevrolet Bolt as possible alternatives. ‚ÄúAs consumers, our power is what we buy. I think younger generations in particular vote with their wallets, and I feel like that might come back to bite.‚Äù

For much of the past decade, Tesla lacked competitors that matched its models‚Äô battery range and other measures of performance. Consumers put off by Musk‚Äôs mischief had few EVs to turn to. As legacy automakers introduce more capable electric models, Tesla won‚Äôt have as much leeway.

‚ÄúWe've seen among the early adopters more of a willingness to take risks or to put up with things that are out of the ordinary,‚Äù says Dovorany, who left Escalent for an automotive tech startup earlier this year. ‚ÄúWe're not seeing that as much with incoming buyers.‚Äù To win this cohort, automakers need to check every box, and for some, that includes employing a CEO who doesn‚Äôt share Hilter memes on social media.

Levitt, the self-described former Musk fanboy, took a test ride last month in a Lucid. He wasn‚Äôt sold on it, partly he says because it didn‚Äôt have enough cargo space for his golf gear. He‚Äôs still waiting for another automaker to steal him away from Tesla and considering models from Audi, Mercedes and BMW.

‚ÄúIf you take Mr. Musk and his antics out of the equation, I'm about 98% certain that my next car would be a Tesla,‚Äù Levitt says. ‚ÄúHis antics put me in play.‚Äù",0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wc4gr0/tsla_elon_musks_antics_turn_owners_and_wouldbe/,wallstreetbets

rjzjme,2021-12-19 15:57:56,Snapchat is primed to the tits !,"TLDR IS AT THE BOTTOM-

Snapchat, its an app all of us (atleast i hope) have herd about or used before ... you know to send nudes and get sneaky links and shit like that . Well  right now at a very strong level of support which is around the 45 dollar mark . Also its about had enough downside as it really cant stay below 45 for much long before rallying from 44-45 back to around 54 bucks where it has strong resistance . Furthermore it has a gap to fill from 77 bucks . It fell due to a miss on its revenue by ... 3 million dollars . WTF instead of making 1.10 billion dollars they made 1.07 billion dollars which is a miss but for it to drop instantly 22% after that is kind of retarded to be honest .

 Revenue increased 57% to $1,067 million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.

* Net loss improved 64% to $(72) million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.
* Adjusted EBITDA improved 209% to $174 million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.
* Operating cash flow was $72 million in Q3 2021, compared to $(55) million in the prior year.
* Free Cash Flow was $52 million in Q3 2021, compared to $(70) million in the prior year.

Its about 44% from its all time high of 80 bucks so its in a good buy zone . Earnings were good just a loss of 3 million from expected revenue is what set it down and with apples privacy updates. But i think it will make up for that apple privacy bs with the meta verse as the years go on , dont forget yall all those snap chat filters and etc are essentially  augmented reality and snap is still investing heavily in  augmented reality .

TLDR-  Snap is primed to the tits , its 44%ish off its ath, apples privacy changes fucked it but metaverse and new users make up for it, it has a gap to fill from 58 to 77 bucks .

Disclaimer- I do own a few calls on snap , its had a lot of nice swings both to the upside and downside

lek9bx,2021-02-07 10:46:19,but what if we try to invest in GOPRO? (GPRO),"Shares of action-camera maker GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) sank more than 20% at their lows on Friday, and remained down 18.6% as of 3:30 p.m. EST. 

The company announced its fourth-quarter earnings results Thursday night, which showed revenue dropping by more than 32% versus the prior-year period. 

So what
Though the company highlighted the 28% sequential improvement in revenue versus the third quarter, the seasonally stronger fourth quarter fell short when compared to the 2019 period. For the full year, 2020 revenue dropped by 25% versus 2019. 

Now what
Though GoPro reported positive earnings for the holiday quarter, it continued its string of annual net losses that started in 2015. Even after earning $44.4 million in the final quarter of 2020, the company lost $66.8 million for the year. 

GoPro has been focusing on growing its subscription base and a direct-to-consumer strategy. Subscribers grew to 761,000 at the end of 2020, 52% ahead of the previous quarter, and 145% higher than one year ago. The company said GoPro.com generated $116 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, almost double the amount of a year ago.

Customers have been spending on more of the company's high-end offerings; cameras with retail prices above $300 represented 91% of quarterly sales. The average selling price to consumers was up 14% to $323, compared to the prior-year period. 

GoPro's strategy of higher-value products and subscription services is helping turn its business around.

While this has been happening intel has been smoothly bringing in nearly 100 billion $ in revenue.

Yeah Intel is not flashy and is currently suffering from its lack of memeticness but it is an absolute titan in the biggest most valuable industry in the world. Fucking semiconductors. You know what that shit does? CPUs baby, basically everything electronic needs this. This industry is the foundation, the building block of all of tech.

Guess what, INTC designs their own chips but more importantly they produce them. Listen carefully this part is important apes, Intel is the only western fab that has any relevance. Intel's competition in production is TSMC. A fucking Taiwanese company, which basically means at any moment it could be a Chinese company (In case any of you decide to look at world affairs and geopolitics). Intel is red, white and blue, an American stonk. Ill let you guys mull that over in your big brains.

Literally go look at any major cap tech company and look at the parabolas that have been formed (AMD, NVDA included). Parabolas most of you didnt enjoy. Well Intel is a parabola you can still enjoy. Im posting today as it is up 2% and has just passed 60$ an important milestone if you care about shit like technical analysis and the Wizard of Oz. I also know you guys dont like to buy things when they are in the red because you have simple circuit breaker brains, but Intel actually literally cant go tits up. Buy calls if you are a degenerate and you are (IV is low so super cheap still), alternatively just buy and hold and in a few months its 50-100% up.

Most of you guys and girls dont know what a 10k or a 10q is but if you have any curiosity go read the balance sheet and income statement of Intels last quarter. This is the titan of titans, its finances are superb. Low debt, high equity, large and growing revenues in the most valuable and ever growing industry in the world. But thats enough fundamentals for WSB.

Intel is still under the radar of most degens and the euphoria of the current market. It will gain favor, and it will gain favor soon. Do yourself a favor and buy INTC now and not at 100$ when its literally 30$ over all time high.

I didnt mention it, but there is a chip shortage, and Patrick Gelsinger (one of the smartest people in silicon valley) is taking over this giant on the 15th. I guarantee this stonk will moon, might even break the trillion dollar barrier in the next year.

Im long INTC with 1700 shares and 500 April 18th 80$ strike calls.

PS: I told one of my girlfriends husband to buy INTC but all he wants to do is HODL sun fucking dial. I guess some things never change.

I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve ever seen a company so shorted at such a low share price before. Ticker FOMC has already acquired multiple companies and is about to acquire a 50 million dollar company (Smartguard Energy) at the end of the month. 

What‚Äôs it‚Äôs market cap after it acquires all the companies including the 50 million? Well right now it‚Äôs 53 million. How is that possible? Well because it‚Äôs obviously not priced in yet.

Now you‚Äôre thinking, well this is too obvious isn‚Äôt it? Don‚Äôt overthink it. It‚Äôs because they used to be a zero bid stock before the new CEO Vikram Grover took over 2 years ago. There isn‚Äôt much confidence yet and it‚Äôs a volatile investment.

ytbqst,2022-11-12 16:30:57,Are Stocks Starting to Become Severely Undervalued?,"Hey everyone,

I was thinking that it might be a good time to start looking for opportunities in the market. I see you guys posting some serious gains a lot of the time and wanted to know what everyone thinks. I was reading an article this morning about META being at a historically low price in terms of value. I just want to know, do you guys think its time to start looking to deploy capital into some of these great stocks that are down 80-90%? Or do you think that things will keep on falling.

I'm making this post to try and have a ""civil"" discussion on where we think the overall market is headed in the near term. Lets say one years time. Is it too early to start looking for these potential great opportunities in the market or is the time now. I know last week the inflation report came out lower then expected, but Its still very high compared to the historic average. That got me wondering if it was just a rally because we havent seen any form of good news in so long that even half good half bad news is enough to cause a significant rally? Anyways when im talking about opportunities, im referring to stuff like they outlined in this article I read this morning, basically it was showing that some stocks are at ridiculously low levels compared to value. The example used was META, its trading at the same price as in 2015 but now its doing $27B in revenue compared to $4B and the EPS in like 5X or 6X higher. I can drop the link to the article I guess, but im really here to discuss the future of the market. Also do you guys think the points brought up about META in the article make sense?

184wucc,2023-11-27 06:51:58,Silver is verging on breaking long term resistance as gold is breaking $2000 USD and is already making new highs in other currencies.,"Okay people. It's been a long time but I've been waiting for this moment.

I've brought up silver before and got some shit for it because essentially I was early to the trade as we've been consolidating since COVID silver prices briefly made new highs. No one wanted to hear about it and it was basically laughed off.

We are on the verge tonight of breaking through long term resistance from 2011 $50 high and the 2021 $30 spike and I believe we will enter some new price discovery in the near future.

The 2011 $50 high can be seen as the second leg of a gigantic 31 year cup with a now 12-year handle, from which it looks like we are breaking out of..

I personally believe this will drive us well beyond $50 over the next year, and if you look at history, there's a good chance we have a crazy next six months. Here is a link showing a repeating pattern that seems to be playing out: [https://twitter.com/AMoneyfest/status/1727137998985158716](https://twitter.com/AMoneyfest/status/1727137998985158716)

Much of this is predicated on gold breaking out, and tonight we see it past it's $2,000 psychological resistance, which we just closed last week above and seem to be holding as support for now. Silver tends to out-perform Gold during Precious Metals bull markets, and I believe we are entering a new era for PMs.

Global financial troubles are paving the way to more currencies being backed with precious metals (BRICS, etc), while industrial use continues to increase, endlessly. Mining operations are set to exhaust most of the Earth's silver by 2035. If this all plays out the way I think it will, Silver and Gold will see new support levels created for silver over the next decade and won't simply see a spike into a sell-off and subsequent return to undervalued silver prices.

My strategy is essentially to look for this downtrend to be broken by a reasonable amount and then look to see it tested as support, at which time I have a hard time believing calls several months out are not a fantastic fucking idea.",9,0.54,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/184wucc/silver_is_verging_on_breaking_long_term/,wallstreetbets

vcacz1,2022-06-14 18:40:38,I predict no recession in 2022. So tired of the doom & gloom every time central banks tighten policy.,"The talking heads on CNBC & WSJ represent the interests of Wall Street. Wall Street only wants one thing: free money forever. The purpose of their recession scaremongering to convince policymakers to reverse course.

In 2013, 2015, and 2018, when the Federal Reserve pivoted after stock market selloffs to delay tapering QE & postpone rate increases, all the recession talk on financial media immediately went away, and stocks quickly rocketed to new records.

Of course, central bankers don't have that luxury this time around due to high inflation.

That‚Äôs not to say there won‚Äôt eventually be a recession - in fact, it‚Äôs probably more likely than not - but it‚Äôs more of a 2023/24 story than a 2022 story.

A recession starting at a 0.75% federal funds rate is simply unheard of. Even with the expected upcoming rate increases, the FFR will still be below neutral into autumn 2022. The economy didn‚Äôt collapse with a 2.5% FFR in 2019, and jobs numbers remained solid; Powell only lowered rates to save the stock market & his own investment portfolio.

The economy is even stronger today than it was in 2019, with even more job openings amid the Great Resignation, workers having more bargaining power than ever in recent history, and consumers sitting on trillions in excess savings.

TL;DR: The stock market is not the economy. There won‚Äôt be a recession this year - and even if there is by a technical definition, pain won‚Äôt be broadly felt (in the form of mass layoffs) until at least 2023. That‚Äôs not to say stocks are a good investment - the 2000-02 bear market wiped 90% off the NASDAQ‚Äôs value, yet the underlying economy did just fine.",0,0.47,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vcacz1/i_predict_no_recession_in_2022_so_tired_of_the/,wallstreetbets

[https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx)

&#x200B;

That's right. Jay Farner, the CEO is going live with Morgan Stanley during a TECH conference to have a fireside chat.

You're going to tell me that they just happened to have this scheduled smack in the middle of the week of hell for RKT shorts? You're going to tell me that there's no way they might drop a bomb that truly sends RKT to the stratosphere?

I have no fucking idea. But I trust in Dan Gilbert & Co. to win. Because that's all they've done for the past 35 fucking years. WIN.

&#x200B;

To make things even sweeter, more dry powder is coming in tomorrow- market makers making new options tomorrow. Remember the first time new options came out for GME? If you bought even the farthest OTM one, it printed.

üö®üö®MM WILL HAVE TO REMAIN DELTA NETURAL WITH THEIR NEW OPTIONS üö®üö®, THUS THEY WILL HAVE TO BUY SHARES. THEREFORE, THE MORE NEW OPTIONS BOUGHT TOMORROW, THE MORE FUEL IS LOADED FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE. üö®üö®

&#x200B;

To close things up, recall that RKT had 40% interest going into this week. Look at today's graph.

[https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l](https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l)

&#x200B;

Notice those two drops where it halted? See the STRONG support that immediately followed? This is a textbook example of a ladder attack. The SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, AT A NEW PRICE. Shorts ATTEMPTED to shake the üíéüëê , but failed. Retail is NOT ALONE on this üöÄ. The DIP is being purchased, even while at an ATH.  Someone is on the LONG side buying up shares with retail.

In my opinion, after today, short interest could potentially even end up way higher than 40%. Look at the candles during those short ladder attacks. Shorts had to have borrow MILLIONS of shares to attempt to short ladder today. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Melvin & CO's latest play to dig themselves out of their Gamestop loss porn either.

MORE SHORTING = MORE SHORTS TO CHOKE

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So that's reason 1. There's a nonzero chance Jay Farner drops a bomb tomorrow that takes us to the stratosphere. But what's reason 2?

üö®üö®MY PRICE TARGET FOR RKT IS $73.5 üö®üö®

Let's go through the numbers.

&#x200B;

RKT's projected EPS for this year is \~ $2.45.

\[LINK 3\] \~ (SOURCE IS ON SA, REMOVED LINK BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING MY POST DELETED)

&#x200B;

To get P/E, take the price and divide by earnings. Thus, we can use this to calculate the forward P/E for RKT. RKT closed at $41.79, which divided by $2.45 is \~17.05. Thus, RKT currently trades at about a 17Forward P/E. Companies in this sector trade in between 15-30 P/E, and since I strongly believe RKT is a growth stock, I think it should trade at 30x P/E.

Thus, 30 x $2.45 is $73.5.

Therefore, my PT for RKT is $73.5. RKT is a fintech company, and is a PROFITABLE one. Think about how many fintech companies have crazier valuations and aren't even profitable?

You know what that means?

IT'S NOT FUCKING OVER. IF SUITS ARE BUYING AT ATH, IM BUYING AT ATH. IF SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZE. THE SUITS AGREE. RKT IS WORTH MORE THAN $40.

&#x200B;

TLDR: SHORT INTEREST HAS PROBABLY GONE UP, SUITS ARE BUYING. CURRENT P/E is 17, GROWTH PE IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE AT LEAST 30. RKT IS STILL UNDERVALUED, AND MY PRICE TARGET IS $73.5

&#x200B;

Remember, üöÄ fundamentally a great company. They are still NOT priced as a growth stock. They are still NOT considered Fintech by the suits. There is a reason why this stock closed strong at a new ATH.

I LIKE THE STOCK.

&#x200B;

üö®üö®My PT is $73.5. üö®üö®

üö®üö®50 TOMORROW üö®üö®

üö®üö®60 to 70+ EOW if the shorts bail instead of of doubling down.üö®üö®

THIS IS NOT A üßªüëêTRADE

&#x200B;

Not financial advice. I don't know anything.

Positions: 150 shares, 50 $23 C 3/5 EXP. I will be exercising almost all my calls as I am LONG.

I will be purchasing OTM calls tomorrow at open üöÄüöÄ

oyfkfj,2021-08-05 11:27:33,The hate on $HOOD is blinding people from making money. Money > Morals,"I get it. RobinHood is a scummy company that fucked over a lot of the people in WSB. Their handling of GME earlier this year was awful, and the CEO's look like if a cocker spaniel crossbred with a blob fish. 

Even with all of that though, I'm bullish on $HOOD for one major reason. Expansion.

&#x200B;

Back in 2019 RobinHood ran an private invite-only program in the UK. Only running for a few months, it was used as a test-bed to find out more about European trading. 

[TechCrunch 2019 - RobinHood gets UK license](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/robinhood-fca/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKG7momxcnbzlJ6EJPxz7t0Ux6sSkRffw06WEHg6HLH6mEVcRAwmuKh-l6iar_yuxYhHI3OEVvm72ziwkLocRvJCHvJxKoYFgrUFqquFSLy71LwgCaDQrMpPb2QX6cdT6UB3-MD-HLPZwNq5HSXNUtWqRvjNs3jsS5593QBP0yVE)

In 2020, amidst all of the Covid chaos, RH announced that they were postponing the UK launch 'Indefinitely'. 

[robinhood.com/uk/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-uk/)

&#x200B;

Now, using this knowledge, combined with my extreme autism and a dash of confirmation bias. I believe this is the next move for RH. 

Why else would they have recently launched their IPO. Could it be because RobinHood is a shady company that robs people of their money and is under legal pressures after the events of the last year; that is possible. But I don't care, because my only interest is the share price of the stock, and the number of zero's at the end of my bank balance.

Btw II

Based on the $200 million estimate of *The Little Mermaid*‚Äôs budget, the Disney movie needs to make at least $500 million at the box office in order to be a success. The general rule of thumb is for a movie to earn back at least 2.5 times its budget, so if *The Little Mermaid*‚Äôs box office comes in between $500-625 million, then Disney‚Äôs latest live-action remake will have been victorious. Still, the studio is most likely eyeing a number closer to $1 billion dollars at the box office before *The Little Mermaid* starts streaming on Disney Plus.

lv8t94,2021-03-01 13:09:20,I'm going to sell GME ...,"... weekly put contracts. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: I'm selling $45 weekly put contracts and pocketing the premium. If the stock happens to go down that low and executes, I'm more than happy to pick up the shares at $45. I'm bullish on the stock. 

&#x200B;

So here's the deal: 

Implied volatility on GME option contracts is crazy right now due to all the excitement and price change over the last several weeks. What does that mean? It's a sellers market. The higher the implied volatility (IV) the higher the premium will be to purchase an option because of its popularity and the likelihood  that a strike price will be met due to drastic price changes. How am I making money in this scenario? I'm selling $45 weekly put contracts. What does that mean? I'm betting that the price of GME will not go below $45 by the time the contract expires (Mar-5). If it does and the contract is executed, I'm obligated to purchase 100 shares at the strike price of $45. Why did I pick $45 strike? That's a price I am comfortable purchasing 100 shares at. That's a price I can afford to purchase shares at. That's a price I am happy to purchase shares at. There are a few key resistances above $45. There is the 50 day moving average (orange line) currently around $60 and the center line of the standard deviation channel (white line) around $50. 

[GME 1 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/vmr72tgjzek61.png?width=1525&format=png&auto=webp&s=26b2d4243fb3d1f77e47b4adb9df531675047808)

The price from last week for a $45 strike Mar-5 put contract is about $1.50. Or $150 for 100 shares. Why risk $4500 for a $150 premium? Because I plan on purchasing the stock anyway. Why not collect a few premiums along the way to bring my cost basis down once it finally executes. 

&#x200B;

Next week my strategy might change. Maybe the price will go lower and I'll sell the next contract at a lower strike. Maybe the contract executes and I'll start selling $420 covered calls. Who knows.

1c566i9,2024-04-16 03:29:52,China's Economy Grew 5.3% Q1 - Does this Affect Rate Cuts Here in the US,"China's economy not only grew 5.3% in Q1 but also inched down their unemployment. In my theory a good economy is good for geopolitical tensions as the need for strife is much lower. Happier waters can lift all boats. 

As well, this means that we need to continue our economic growth. I don't know china's monetary policy at the moment but I think they are somewhat loose on their policy with lower rates than higher per se. Not an expert here. 

My question is does this increase the chance of rate cuts or decrease here in the US? 

My reason for it would be that with a China on the rise we must stay competitive and loosen policy. That plus the inflation that is now going to be coming in is from geopolitical pressures that will expeditiously make matters worse. How can you punish the American citizen double because of bad world actors? Tightening a loose policy is one thing. Higher gas at the pumps because Iran went off the rails is something else entirely.

SoundHound AI is forecast to increase revenue approximately 50% in both 2024 and 2025, according to Yahoo Finance. Given last year's sales of roughly $46 million, this implies SoundHound AI will reach $100 million in revenue by 2025.

For this analysis, I'll assume that SoundHound AI can keep growing revenue at 50% through 2030. Should the company achieve this level of growth, this would result in $780 million of sales by 2030.

Additionally, SoundHound AI stock recently traded at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 29.3. Assuming this normalizes to a more reasonable level of 15, for example, SoundHound AI's future market cap would be around $11.7 billion.

This is roughly 550% higher than the company's current market cap. This means that a hypothetical investment of $100,000 would be worth $650,000 by 2030 -- far from $1 million.

So, **Thor** along with several other titles grossed well this weekend in theatres across the world. But AMC specifically did very well over the weekend. **Outperforming it's numbers this time last year by 12%** just on admission sales. I personally bought a big ass popcorn and drink and some chocolate covered almonds, myself. And I'm wondering if that 12% figure from the above linked article includes those expensive damn snacks. If not, then AMC is definitely about to short skweeze. lmao. Anyway, just based on this great news for AMC being pumped all over the internetz this morning. Retail traders may ride on the backs of casual investors who are reading this news and looking for a lighthouse in the Fed storm. I can't say for sure with just sentiment data, obviously. But I will make this bet: AMC isn't going DOWN today. That, I'm very confident of.

n1uiek,2021-04-30 14:03:03,MVIS is bargain of the century right now,"So let me get this straight. 

Royalties this year are expected to be $3.3 million for 2021 (virtually double the 2020 royalties) thanks to the $22 billion contract between Microsoft and the US army. S2upid smashed up a Hololens to prove MVIS tech was in it and MVIS confirmed it was their part in S2upids video during their meeting May 2020.

We also now have back on the table the rumoured $100million deal with Sharp who have just had a 12 month extension granted to their exclusivity deal for MVIS tech for a display/smart speaker etc.

We then have the value of 484 patents as of last year, which has no doubt increased in number since then.

We also have the disruptive best in class A sample LIDAR produced this month, which beats anything from  anyone else hands down.  A bidding war feels imminent on this, unless a deal has already been agreed privately subject to maybe one more milestone of them testing it themselves first...

And then add on the other products that they are working on. 

I‚Äôm amazed this hasn‚Äôt gone higher in share price! It definitely feels like it will be a 3 figure stock for the buy out. 

It just shows how much power the hedge funds have when they short, to drag the price down so low. I thought they might have learned a lesson from GME but clearly not!",96,0.59,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n1uiek/mvis_is_bargain_of_the_century_right_now/,wallstreetbets

wre6zq,2022-08-18 08:40:07,Can we have an honest discussion on BBBY?,"No snide, no insult hurling, no culty or conspiratorial behavior, can we have facts?

Obligatory disclosure - I have a very inconsequential short position on BBBY at $26

Now, to the discussion of the recently transpired events. What is the bullish case for BBBY now, really? Let me point out my view of things, along with some (in my opinion) wrong things that have been thrown around

1. Short interest is still high. There is no discussion about that. But the borrow fee is nowhere near prohibitive. Right now it sits at 67%. If a short believes there is at least that downside in a year, or whatever downside they believe there is adjusted for the time they intend to hold, it's perfectly rational to short.  I personally believe the downside is pretty short term, let me elaborate
2. The filing from yesterday. Let's clear some things out

a) The filing is legit. The report even came quite late, if you look at the SEC website [https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/form-144-email](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/form-144-email) and get the file, the timestamps seem to indicate this document was online already at noon. You all could have been earlier and beat the headline and make a hefty profit, had you known in advance

b) The filing is a clear intention to sell. Form 144 is titled literally NOTICE OF PROPOSAL TO SELL

c) We don't know if Cohen sold yet, or not. Affirming EITHER is the case has no basis. But the fact is that the intention is there, and the filing expressly states that a sell order has been filed with JPM along with the 144 form, to be executed starting 8/16. Why are people denying this?

d) Some people argue that he only wants to sell his options. I'm assuming Cohen is a rational man and if this is the case and he really only wants to sell options, the filing is utterly stupid and self destructive. He could have only filed for selling the options, but no, he's filing for the WHOLE position. He is a whale in BBBY. He KNOWS he is a whale in BBBY. He KNOWS that this filing means an intention to sell. He KNOWS that people are watching his every move, and that this filing would be easily and convincingly interpreted bearishly. WHY, if he's rational, would he make a move that tanks his own position if he intends to hold?

e) Some people argue that he was obligated to file a 144 form because of 10% ownership only. This is incorrect, the only required form is 13D, which he did file on the same day, or one day earlier. There is no obligation to file a 144 if you have no intention to sell.

f) Some people argue that he cannot sell until late September without forfeiting the gains because of Section 16b. This is incorrect. Section 16b only applies for profits on purchases and sales (or sales and purchases) where BOTH operations are performed when the agent is an officer of the corporation or holds 10% equity. Cohen's purchases were done at a time where he held 0% equity, section 16b does not apply at all.

3) Late yesterday, BBBY came with a statement that reads, quote

>BED BATH & BEYOND SAYS PLEASED TO HAVE REACHED CONSTRUCTIVE AGREEMENT WITH RC VENTURES IN MARCH & ARE COMMITTED TO MAXIMIZING VALUE FOR ALL SHAREHOLDERS  
>  
>BED BATH & BEYOND SAYS HAVE BEEN WORKING EXPEDITIOUSLY OVER PAST SEVERAL WEEKS WITH EXTERNAL FINANCIAL ADVISORS, LENDERS ON STRENGTHENING BALANCE SHEET

If you have read enough of these statements, you'd know that ""PLEASED TO HAVE REACHED CONSTRUCTIVE AGREEMENT WITH RC VENTURES IN MARCH"" usually means they don't really agree on terms and are moving forward separately. This FULLY explains RC getting out of the position.

Also, BED BATH & BEYOND SAYS HAVE BEEN WORKING \[...\] WITH EXTERNAL FINANCIAL ADVISORS, LENDERS ON STRENGTHENING BALANCE SHEET. This means in 99% of the cases that a cash raise and dilution is incoming.

Both of the above are, of course, my opinion only and open to interpretation.

4) and this is the one that bugs me the most, why the rationalization? I propose the mental exercise of imagining that it wasn't RC filing this 144, but the board members. I would bet hard cash that this sub would be all over kicking and insulting the board for ""not believing in the company"", ""lining their own pockets"", etc, etc. Why do you behave so differently when RC files the same?

I welcome respectful discussion, I will promptly ignore nonsensical attacks, as I have not made any attacks on my side at all (I believe)

EDIT - Even though I'm of the opinion above, I also honestly think RC is not being malicious here, nor pumping and dumping, at all. I think the board is blocking him, his plan did not work, and he wants out.

EDIT 2- many comments pointing out that he files this just in preparation if he ever wants to sell. Can anyone point me to a similar filing for GME? As far as I can find, he has never filed intention to sell on GME.

18i1s3f,2023-12-14 05:50:43,My employee called me a üåàüêª and then quit,"So, I‚Äôm a supervisor at Wendy‚Äôs and I had a 1 to 1 with one of my more problematic employees. This kid was a full charity case diversity hire, it might be an adult, but it has the mental age of a 4 year old and ticked nearly every box for learning and mental disabilities. It‚Äôs so bad I struggle to believe it‚Äôs human, it‚Äôs full on regarded in every sense of the word. I don‚Äôt know how, but it somehow managed to operate the till and thinks that‚Äôs the height of modern technology, so much so that it thinks Wendy‚Äôs is a global tech giant about to take on Apple.

Anyway, during our 1 to 1 I wanted to try to relate to this thing a little bit better. I know it‚Äôs interested in the market (it talks about shorting Apple all the time because it will make the difference in ensuring Wendy‚Äôs outperforms them) and this was just as the interest rate decision was going to be made and all of a sudden this thing shouts at me, ‚Äúoh shit you‚Äôre a üåàüêª too?!?‚Äù. Now, on the side I may or may not have been embezzling money from Wendy‚Äôs and may or may not be down $128k. To say I‚Äôm f-ed is an understatement. I may or may not have been shorting BTC because it‚Äôs obviously a Ponzi. Now, say what you will but as long as I can keep this secret long enough, I will hit the jackpot. I‚Äôve gone with 4x 0DTE OTM options because I know it will eventually collapse, and when that happens this will be the best way to profit from it. They‚Äôre virtually free and will pay off millions. It‚Äôs only logical.

Anyway, now I‚Äôm freaking out that it figured out what I was doing. So, I‚Äôve got to fire him right but I need HRs approval. I tell it that, and it suddenly mumbles some random incoherent mess at me and quits! I was honestly relieved, I no longer had to deal with it, my secret is safe, and I can now fire the guy I pay to wipe this things bottom after it sh*ts. I never liked that guy, but funnily enough no one wants to wipe for other people.

Problem is though, now this thing is hiding out behind the dumpster at the back of the shop. Is it trying to ambush me? I‚Äôve tried calling the police since it‚Äôs trespassing, but I can‚Äôt get it to go away. It keeps telling me it can offer me a good time for $20. Is that code for telling me it knows I‚Äôve been making $20 bets on BTC using Wendy‚Äôs money?

In hindsight, I don‚Äôt actually think it‚Äôs smart enough to know what I‚Äôm doing, so it was probably an overreaction. But I am still paranoid about it all.

Is anyone able to provide some advice on what to do with this thing? I don‚Äôt need any investing advice, I‚Äôve got it all under control.

I think my employee might also be active on this in. I‚Äôve just come across this post which appears to be him:

1dg77qy,2024-06-15 01:57:43,Economist Harry Dent predicts stock market crash worse than 2008 crisis: The ‚Äòbubble of all bubbles‚Äô,"Harry Dent, the outspoken financial author and economist, isn‚Äôt reversing course from his bold ""crash of a lifetime"" declaration this past December.

Speaking in an updated interview with Fox News Digital, Dent cautioned that the ""everything"" bubble¬†has still yet to burst, and¬†it may be a bigger crash than the Great Recession.

""In 1925 to ‚Äò29, it was a natural bubble. There was no stimulus behind that, artificial stimulus per se. So this is new. This has never happened,"" Dent said on Tuesday. ""What do you do if you want to cure a hangover? You drink more. And that's what they've been doing.""

""Flooding the economy with extra money forever might actually enhance the overall economy long-term. But we'll only see when we see this bubble burst,"" he added.¬† ""And again, this bubble has been going 14 years. Instead of most bubbles \[going\] five to six, it's been stretched higher, longer. So you'd have to expect a bigger crash than we got in 2008 to '09.""

  
Interested to know what you all think about this. I have also been seeing people go into other financial forums I have been in and saying the same thing. Apparently the signs will start to show themselves in late March 2025. I found it interesting that the CEO of Nvidia is set to cash out 700 million in Nvidia stock right around that time. Maybe it's a coincidence?  Please put politics aside and where the source of the news came from. Let's have an honest discussion.
