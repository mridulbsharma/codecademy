**Property Fraud Allegations Snowball as Commercial Real-Estate Values Fall**

>U.S. prosecutors are cracking down on commercial mortgage fraud, a growing push that is sending shudders through the $4.7 trillion industry by raising questions about the numbers underpinning major property loans.

>Regulators and federal prosecutors say that property loans based on doctored building financials and valuations have been rising. This type of fraud became more widespread between the mid-2010s and 2021, federal investigators and real-estate brokers say, when commercial property prices surged to new highs and landlords had much to gain from such maneuvers. 

>Now, the drop in property values caused by higher interest rates and a rise in defaults are exposing more of these schemes, dealing another blow to a commercial real-estate market suffering through its worst stretch since the 2008-09 financial crisis. 

>“It’s a general trend throughout history that fraud occurs during boom times and is revealed during bust times,” said John Griffin, a professor of finance at the University of Texas’ McCombs School of Business.

>In most cases, real-estate fraud is made possible because lenders take a hands-off approach to assessing a building’s value. As long as the numbers look in line with those of similar properties, lenders usually trust that they are accurate, brokers say. Auditing books is expensive and time consuming, and lenders competing for deals may be reluctant to antagonize landlords with onerous due diligence. ... ...  
  
Since last fall, at least five different landlords of properties, mostly apartment buildings, in cities including Cincinnati, Hartford, Conn., and Little Rock, Ark., have pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges. Some allegedly doctored building income statements, others allegedly faked property sales at inflated prices, all to get bigger loans.",25,0.84

VF Corp. which oversees multiple popular retail brands in the likes of Vans, Northface, Supreme etc has been in freefall due to the incompetence of previous management, but the turnaround process has started and the moves they are making remind me a lot of another retail giant in Abercrombie and Fitch.

The success of any retail clothing company hinges on the demand for their products, and VF recently poached one of the best in the game from Lululemon in Sun Choe. This hire gives me the most confidence in the direction of the brand from a style and demand perspective.

One of the biggest concerns analysts have had with $VFC has been the debt on the balance sheet, which is also about to be eliminated in a big way. At Q1 earnings, VF announced they have completed their strategic portfolio review and have now hired Goldman Sachs to oversee the sale of one of their brands. Everyone in the industry suspects this to be Supreme, which is going to command a good price and take A LOT of stress off the balance sheet. A sale announcement at Q2 earnings call could absolutely rocket the stock.

Insiders at the company know the turnaround is coming: top executives continue to buy up the stock and nobody from within is selling. Today, volume is significantly down from where it’s been while the price is charging. In a downtrend this tells me one thing: the sellers are gone, and we’re about to start moving.",12,0.87

13,1dymsup,2024-07-08 22:56:12,Why a Lucid Air Sapphire for James Bond?,"1.	Innovative Technology: The Lucid Air Sapphire represents the latest in electric vehicle technology with impressive performance and range, making it ideal for the high-tech world of James Bond.
	2.	Environmental Awareness: In an era where sustainability is becoming increasingly important, Bond using an electric vehicle could set a sign for environmental consciousness.
	3.	Design and Aesthetics: The Lucid Air Sapphire has a sleek, modern design that fits well with the sophisticated and stylish image that Bond fans expect from 007.
	4.	Performance: With its extreme acceleration and speed, the Sapphire would be perfect for the spectacular chase scenes and evasive maneuvers that are standard in Bond films.

Marketing Potential

Such placement would not only prominently highlight the Lucid brand to a global audience but also strengthen the image of the electric vehicle in general. Associating with a cultural icon like James Bond could help position electric vehicles as desirable, powerful, and technologically advanced options in the automobile market.

Implementation

For successful integration, Lucid Motors might need to collaborate with the film producers to ensure the vehicle is authentically embedded in the plot and its unique features are used sensibly. Additionally, a marketing campaign around the film’s release could maximize the effect, similar to how other car brands have done with their Bond cars in the past.

Overall, featuring a Lucid Air Sapphire in a James Bond film could be an exciting opportunity for Lucid to showcase its brand on the global market while also reinforcing the image of electric vehicles as the cars of the future.",5,0.63

It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.

If chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.

Now for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. You're paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.

MSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.

AAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.

That fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.

I agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it.

The markets today reacted slightly positively on the Boeing plea deal announcement but for most people Boeing accepting it was obvious.

I think the real point to focus on here is whether Boeing will be able to get access to government contracts or not. Most people who are bearish after the plea deal news are probably thinking about the government contracts. These contracts make up 37% of Boeing’s sales and government approval generally provides confidence to private customers. What do you guys think?

The possibility seems unsure but legal precedent leans in the restoration of government contracts access.

Personally I think the government will continue to be forgiving towards Boeing, although they are likely to receive more public backlash (maybe a judge might step in too). 

Note that the government might not end up choosing Boeing for these contracts but I don’t think that detail matters as much for the bulk of investors.",11,0.71

There are 98 Million CORZW outstanding. Any warrant holder, at any time, can exercise this warrant by submitting it to the company, paying the $6.81 strike price, and get 1 share of CORZ. But if you do the math, the $5.05 warrant price, plus the $6.81 strike price is $11.86, which is much higher than the $10.29 price of CORZ. If you like money, you wouldn't exercise your warrant, you would just sell the warrant to someone else. The warrants are a 2.5 year option and have a lot of time value (premium) in them. Over the next 3 years, the tranche 1 warrants has potential to provide proceeds of $670M, which can be used to pay down secured notes, equipment-backed debt, and remaining other debt allowing the company to be debt free (Remaining debt 348m) So for simplicity purposes, we are going to look at market cap fully diluted. 



The company has 82 Million warrants that can be exercised by the warrant holder at $0.01 per share. They can only be exercised after the stock has a VWAP greater than $8.72 for 20 consecutive trading days. As of 7/5 we're at 16 days, making Thursday 7/12 the likely date that this trigger is met (provided we don't fall below 8.72 any day on a VWAP basis). 

CORZ has $260M of Convertible notes (bonds). The trigger for conversion was met on Friday(7/5). All of the people holding these securities will be forced to exchange them for shares which will wipe $260M of debt off of CORZ's balance sheet. Simultaneously, the company will issue 44.58M shares of stock to the noteholders.



500 MW HPC Hosting (Best out of the bitcoin miners, been building since 2019)

The datacenter industry is changing, and according to the Uptime Institute, datacenters today operate at 6 KW/rack, and CORZ is able to deliver 100 KW/rack for Blackwell GPU architecture with liquid cooling, with eventual generations of GPUs needing > 200 KW/rack overtime that operators like CORZ are able to deliver, in addition to having > 100 Gb/s Ethernet in proximity to growing datacenter markets such as Dallas and Atlanta. 

  


First 200 MW HPC Sold to Coreweave for 12 years for 2.5Bil profit

Next 70 HW HPC  (6/25),  Coreweave exercised its first option for delivery of additional 70MW of infrastructure to host NVDA GPUs for HPC with site

modifications expected to begin in 2H24 and operational status anticipated in 2H25. The contract

is at similar economics to first 200MW agreement with revenues of $1.45M/MW, adding additional

$1.225B in cumulative revenue over the 12-year contract.

3.5Bil over 12 years, (power costs pass to coreweave), (possible 5 year extensions). 



 (Datacenter REITS with monolithic tier digital infrastructure and already booked MW capacity for AI/HPC trade at > 20x EBITDA).







**230 MW Remaining.**

However, if we take a look at what Coreweave stands to gain using some simple assumptions: 

- **200 megawatts** leased 

- **H100s** require consume **700 watts**

- **200 megawatts** of energy can accommodate approximate **285,000 H100s** (200 megawatts \* 100000 watts per megawatt / 700 watts)

- let's be conservative and say 200 megawatts can accommodate **200,000 H100s**

- Fronting the cost of 200,000 H100s, each GPU around $30,000 \*will be **6 billion dollars** 

- Assuming a lifespan of 3 years for these GPU's, and assuming that after every 3 years, they are replaced with new GPUs, this means the total cost of GPU's over a 12 year period will be **24 billion** (without doing any discounting)

- Upfront cost of **Tier 3 Data Centers** is around $23,000 per killowatt, for 200 MW, this means around **4.6 billion**

- Adding all of the costs up **28.6 billion** 

- Coreweave currently charges around (4.25 - 4.76) for H100 variants, so assuming $4.50 per hour of GPU, this leads to around **5.76 billion** per year

- after discounting, using **10% interest rate and 0.7 utilization rate** of the GPU's, for a 12 year period the total revenue comes out to around **34.58 billion**

- subtracting this from the total cost of **28.6 billion**, this means that Coreweave, conservatively,  stands to earn  **5.89 billion** 



What this means is that Core Scientific, if they were to follow an asset-heavy model and pursue their own clients instead of leasing to Coreweave, could stand to have **5.89 billion** of profits instead of the **2.5 billion** it received from the Coreweave for **200 megawatts**.



But assuming they go asset light again, of all the miners they are primed to receive the next HPC deal, given they have already done a deal with an NVDA backed company and they have the best infrastructure and can deliver sooner than other miners. If they choose to lease out the remaining 230 MPW for similar deals, say in a leasing structure, another 2.5 bil would not be outside the realm of possibility. bringing total profits up to 6b over 12 years for 4b.  If they manage to get even better deals for the remaining 230 MW, then the stock could rerate by billions quickly. It is basically an AI utility company with a Bitcoin mining segment attached as a call option.

  


From Compass Point Research

BTC Mining/MW Breakdown: CORZ released their May production update (see here ), and mined 447 BTC at implied \~90% uptime of its 20.4 EH/s of self-mining installed capacity. Based on the recent production report, CORZ fleet efficiency surprised to the upside at 24 J/Th (489 MW of power) and we see potential for better hosting margins (\~115MW assuming 50/50 S19XPs and S21s). We expect CORZ to look to curtail operations and lock in lower power prices in an effort to maximize profitability post-halving. Starting in 3Q24 as CORZ transitions machines away from HPC sites, we expect operating hash rate of \~15.5 EH/s in 3Q23, and \~16.5 EH/s in 4Q24, before further improving to \~18.5 EH/s in CY25. The company expects to see minimal disruption of mining business during HPC transition with ability to move machines to other site (likely West Texas) and build out of partially built infrastructure (\~796MW currently operating, full potential of \~1.1-2GW), which we are modeling capex to build 300MW of capacity during CY24-25. Overall we continue to believe CORZ mining business is in a good position post halving with < $0.04 hash costs, and we continue to expect operating leverage from higher BTC/Hash prices 2H24/2025 (hash price reached \~9.5c last weekend from elevated transaction fees).



 

These are the estimated returns on bitcoin mining by compass research. Slap whatever multiple you want on that to get your upside. 

2025 Adj. Mining EBITDA $ 251

46,1dyca8a,2024-07-08 15:51:21,My way of investing… Keep 50% cash on hand during the Fall/Winter.,"I like to make money trading stocks. The United States is founded on Judeo-Christian values whether you like it or not. The last three recessions have started in the Fall/Winter (since the early 2000’s). I know using seasons to predict the stock market might seem stupid but just vibe with me here for a second. I have a feeling that the next recession will start in the Fall or Winter because life tends to die off in during those times plus a lot of other reasons. Then I invest all of my money during the Spring and Summer months, only picking a few high conviction stocks to bring  my ROI up to above average returns. Then when Fall comes along I sell most of my positions to bring me back to 50% cash on hand - rinse and repeat. I don’t think there is any right way of calculating the bottom of a recession. Timing the market can be stressful and infuriating but if I know when the recession will happen I think I will have enough will power to not invest because bad news travels faster than good news.

I bought into $BRKb a couple of years ago. As you can see I'm quite happy with the 122% gain over this period. But what am I supposed to do with it now to actually get any benefit out of this share? They don't pay dividend so I'm not getting any yield on my investments. They pretty much never do a stock split so it's not like my number of shares can grow. Obviously I can sell it and cash out the gain, but isn't BRK generally treated as a ""buy don't trade"" stock. Price very seldom goes down, so it isn't likely I can sell now and buy at the dip, so if I sell it then it's unlikely I buy back in, I'd just be losing the difference doing that.

So what do people do with BRK? Do they just sit on it forever until one day they need the cash and are liquidating their portfolio. Do people trade in and out of BRK or just buy and hold? I'd like to redeploy that capital in something with a bigger growth story potential, but I want to stay in BRK also.",8,0.67

51,1dybq8k,2024-07-08 15:27:47,Going All-In on NYCB,"I have been following NYCB for some time now. Steve Mnuchin's involvement in the stock is what initially piqued my interest. Why would someone with his level of Wall Street experience jump into a bank that is headed for bankruptcy? An intriguing question.

I think now might be the time to jump back into the stock for a few reasons: 

-**Reverse stock split on 7/11**: This has no impact on the value of the stock, yada yada. I get it. But, in a situation where NYCB is fighting market psychology, this could be bullish if it can change the narrative from a failing bank on the brink of bankruptcy to a resilient turnaround story. It's all window dressing, but that may still be valuable. 

-**Upcoming earnings**: NYCB will be announcing earnings on 7/25. Between 1Q earnings and now, NYCB completed an asset sale to JPM (https://ir.mynycb.com/files/doc\_financials/2024/q1/NYCB-1Q-2024-Earnings-Earnings-Presentation-5-1-2024.pdf). NYCB trades at a price-to-TBV of less than .5, well below its competitors. It's priced as if there is still a significant risk of bankruptcy despite the JPM asset sale improving its liquidity metrics across the board (CETI1, cash-to-assets, loan-to-deposit ratio, etc.). If they can demonstrate balance sheet stabilization and deliver an earnings beat, I think there is the potential for a large post-earnings bump. 

-**Improving odds of a September rate cut**: It is no secret that rising interest rates have been a large issue for regional banks. A September rate cut would help NYCB (and the other regional banks) dig out of the hole that they are currently in. The entire industry is (likely) going to be headed in the right direction over the next six to nine months. 

-**Political tailwinds:** Everyone watched the debate last week. Trump is now the odds on favorite to be the next President of the United States. Even if he does not directly intervene, Trump's association with New York real estate and Mnuchin is likely to be perceived as a tailwind for this stock. 

-**Strong management team**: Mnuchin and Joe Otting know what they are doing. They've run this playbook before with OneWest. They are both incredibly well-connected in the financial industry and have decades of experience in the financial services industry. They know more than us about this bank. And they chose to invest. I trust their judgement. To believe NYCB's credit quality issues are going to continue, you have to believe that someone as savvy as Mnuchin made an extremely bad bet. 

TLDR: Improving macroeconomic backdrop for regional banks, political connections with the (potential) Trump administration, strengthening balance sheet, veteran leadership team.

RATING: BUY

PRICE TARGET: $50.63

UPSIDE: 10.0%

The US Economy continues to demonstrate resilience. A leisure stock like Carnival Cruise Line posted great Q2 results and guidance with “strong booking momentum, with record volumes for 2025 sailing.” ([Carnival Stock Breaks Out As '25 Bookings Already Top Full Year '24 | Investor's Business Daily (investors.com)](https://www.investors.com/news/carnival-cruise-q2-earnings/)) What's another stock for leisure? Airlines.

# Why did CCL Stock Rise After Q2 Earnings?

1. Record Financial Performance:

Record Revenues: Carnival reported record second-quarter revenues of $5.8 billion.

Operating Income: Achieved record operating income of $560 million, nearly five times the 2023 levels.

Net Income: Significant improvement in net income, nearly $500 million higher than 2023, with adjusted net income outperforming March guidance by nearly $170 million.

2. Increased Guidance:

Full Year 2024 Guidance Raised: Carnival raised its full-year net yield guidance to approximately 10.25% and increased full-year adjusted net income guidance by approximately $275 million due to continued strong demand.

Positive Outlook for 2025: Early bookings for 2025 were even higher than 2024 in both price and occupancy, indicating strong future demand.

3. Strong Demand and Bookings:

Record Customer Deposits: Customer deposits reached an all-time high of $8.3 billion, surpassing the previous record by $1.1 billion.

High Occupancy and Prices: The cumulative booked position for the remainder of 2024 was the best on record, with occupancy and prices significantly higher than the previous year.

4. Operational Efficiency and Strategic Moves:

Cost Management: Adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per available lower berth day (ALBD) were better than prior year and March guidance due to cost savings and timing of expenses.

Strategic Portfolio Optimization: The decision to sunset the P&O Cruises (Australia) brand and fold its operations into Carnival Cruise Line, along with other strategic reallocations, aimed to optimize the company's brand portfolio and enhance performance.

5. Capital Management and Refinancing:

Debt Management: Carnival continued its efforts to manage its debt profile by prepaying $1.6 billion of its senior secured term loans and repricing other loan facilities. These actions are expected to save significant interest expenses over time and reduce net interest expense by $55 million in 2024.

Strong Liquidity: The company ended the quarter with $4.6 billion of liquidity.

These positive financial results, along with the raised guidance and strong future outlook, likely contributed to the surge in Carnival's stock price.

# What Happened in DAL Q1 2024

**Positive News from Delta Airlines' Q1 2024 Earnings Report**

1. Strong Operational Performance: Delta achieved industry-leading operational performance with record March quarter completion factors and on-time performance.
2. Financial Metrics:

Record Revenue: Operating revenue of $13.7 billion and adjusted operating revenue of $12.6 billion, up 6% from Q1 2023.

Earnings and Cash Flow: Adjusted EPS of $0.45 and operating cash flow of $2.5 billion.

Positive Outlook: Strong guidance for Q2 2024 with expected record revenue, operating margin of 14-15%, and EPS of $2.20 to $2.50.

Full-Year 2024 Guidance: Expected EPS of $6 to $7 and free cash flow of $3 to $4 billion.

3. Corporate and Domestic Travel Demand:

Corporate sales grew by 14% year-over-year, driven by the return of large corporate accounts.

Domestic unit revenues were a record for the March quarter, with a 3% year-over-year growth.

4. International Travel:

International passenger revenue was 12% higher than Q1 2023.

5. Revenue Diversification:

Diversified revenue streams, including loyalty programs and premium services, continued to grow.

6. Employee Engagement:

$1.4 billion in profit-sharing payouts, celebrating Delta employees' contributions to operational excellence.

 

**Negative News from Delta Airlines' Q1 2024 Earnings Report**

1. Cost Performance:

Operating expense of $13.1 billion and adjusted operating expense of $11.9 billion.

Adjusted non-fuel costs increased by 1.5% year-over-year.

2. Debt Levels:

Total debt and finance lease obligations were $19.4 billion at the end of the quarter.

Adjusted net debt of $20.2 billion at the end of the quarter, though reduced from the previous year.

3. Mixed Revenue Environment:

Total unit revenue (TRASM) was down 0.7% year-over-year.

Headwinds from Cargo and MRO impacted revenue growth.

4. Non-fuel Cost Increases:

Non-fuel unit costs are expected to increase by approximately 2% in Q2 2024 and remain at low single-digit growth for the full year.

The stock's initial jump could be attributed to the strong revenue, operational performance, and positive outlook. The subsequent drop might have been influenced by concerns over rising costs, debt levels, and mixed revenue environment. The stock's rebound in the following month likely reflects investor confidence in Delta's long-term guidance and operational improvements.

**Delta Guidance in Q1 2024 Report**

**For Q2 2024:**

Total Revenue YoY: Up 5% - 7%

Operating Margin: 14% - 15%

Earnings Per Share (EPS): $2.20 - $2.50

**For FY 2024:**

Earnings Per Share (EPS): $6 - $7

Free Cash Flow: $3 - $4 billion

Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR: 2x - 3x.

# Here’s Where Its Interesting

Free cash flow is king. The FCF in 2019 was 3.4B. Delta’s guidance for FCF for 2024 is 3B to 4B. However, the market cap back in 2019 was $37.6B while the current market cap is around 30B. That means Delta still has 7B room for growth in this apples-to-apples scenario.

Let’s assume the lower end of the FCF guidance at 3B. Using the market cap of 2019 as a reference point, the expected market cap in 2024 would be 32.4B which means DAL could go to $50.63 which is an upside of 10% or a gain of $4.61 per share.

# Market Cap and Free Cash Flow

|DATE|12/31/2019|12/31/2024|
|:-|:-|:-|
|FCF|3.489B|3B|
|Mkt Cap|37,681B|30,142B|
|P/FCF|10.80|10.05|

# Price Prediction Using FCF Guidance

|If 2024 FCF is|3B|
|:-|:-|
|Then the expected Mkt Cap is|$32.4B|
|Therefore, the expected DAL Stock Price is|$50.63|
|DAL Current Price|$46.02|
|**Upside $**|**+$4.61**|
|**Upside $**|**10.0%**|

**Potential Risks**

1. Comparing Delta's 2019 market cap and FCF to today 2024 may not be appropriate. Crude oil was cheaper, and interest rates were lower back in 2019. Crude Oil per barrel was around $59 compared to today at $82. Highest Fed Funds rate in 2019 was 2.42% compared to 5.33% today.
2. The Free Cash Flow guidance is currently $3B - $4B for 2024. Guidance may need to be upgraded in Q2 earnings to continue the stock momentum. Travel trends could be underwhelming [DAL 46.02 ▼ −2.89% Unnamed (tradingview.com)](https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20240705004989:0/)

58,1dy742b,2024-07-08 12:00:07,My DD on Sirius Xm ,"     First off, let's talk about the elephant in the room - the stock price. SIRI has been beaten down like a piñata at a kid's birthday party. We're talking about a stock that's down more than 60% from its 2018 peak and is still within sight of the 12-year low reached earlier this month.
     Now, let's talk about the business itself. Sirius XM is the result of the 2008 merger of satellite radio outfits Sirius and XM, which combined their collective reach into a single dominant name at a time when internet-based alternatives were starting to get real traction. The company has a strong track record of profitability, with 10-figure annual free cash flow for years now. With a 44% lower share count compared to 2012, the company is like a well-oiled machine, chugging along with efficiency and precision.
     Wait, there's more! The stock's prolonged weakness has led to another compelling outcome - it's inflated the dividend yield. With a forward-looking dividend yield of 4.1%, SIRI is like a cosmic cash cow, ready to shower you with riches from the heavens. With only about one-third of its earnings dished out to shareholders in the form of dividends, there's plenty of wiggle room for growth. It's like having a money tree that not only grows but also pays you to watch it grow! Not to mention the over 2 billion in revenue combined with over 1 billion in tangible assets! (maybe this is why Warren Buffett keeps investing in Sirius?) 
      What about the competition you ask? Well, contrary to a common assumption, Sirius XM isn't doomed due to the advent of more convenient alternative forms of audio entertainment. The company has been making strategic moves to stay relevant in the ever-evolving media landscape. For example, they recently launched Unified ID 2.0, allowing their ad-supported programming's advertisers to more precisely target customers in an environment that's obscuring web users' unique digital footprints. It's like having a secret weapon to navigate the treacherous waters of the digital universe!
Also let's not forget about the star power. Sirius XM recognizes the importance of being able to leverage the exclusivity of its on-air celebrities like Howard Stern. 
     So, should I buy shares and call options on SIRI? Well, i like a stock that's been beaten down to a pulp but still has the potential for orbital comeback. This is not financial advice, i am regarded. ",28,0.71

 Now I didn’t deposit 25k and ran it to zero, I would deposit a couple thousand above 25k to day trade following pdt and deposit more when my account dropped below 25k. In March my account dropped below 25k again and I had no way to bring it back to 25k so I quit trading everyday for 4 months to regroup and make some money outside of the market with my real job and split my account into a few small accounts to trade here and there following pdt.

During this time, I made 35k from my real job and also 1k from trading small accounts. This had led me to have confidence and capital to combine my small accounts back and deposit 27k into we bull again to fully day trade again since July 1st.

This time feels different. I am controlling my emotions better and results are better than before. Currently I’m up $1178  after my deposit.

77,1dxyxdh,2024-07-08 03:27:59,"NFE - LNG/utility stock trading just above fresh 52wk L, 9x E, 6x Fwd E, 1.54x FFO for next 18 months","Anyone familiar with NFE has become accustomed to missed deadlines and seemingly endless delays surrounding their Altamira, MX offshore LNG export facility. First estimated to be online 12 months ago and now having missed 4 other self imposed deadlines the market has clearly lost its patience which is why the stock has dropped from $29.11 to $19.4 in the last 36 trading sessions. But as the saying goes: buy low, sell high. NFE has traded between $19 - $63 since August 2021. 

https://preview.redd.it/llympyzvn7bd1.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9e9c60e80b05a190d9ebc0ed90ce861a3be605f

At this very moment NFE / Altamira are closer to going live than ever and yet the stock trades for a pittance versus trailing earnings, forward E, and management's FFO guidance. Cheniere Energy (LNG) which operates the Freeport LNG export site trades for 16x forward E, nearly 3x more than NFE currently. A recent (6/21) note by an analyst at Stifel set a $40 PT (outperform rating) with expectations of $1.4B & $2B EBITDA for 2024 & 2025 while NFE's EV sits around $11.8B. Markets rarely offer utility-like cash flows such as NFE's for this cheap. 

Meanwhile shorts continue to push the stock lower on a near daily basis with short interest at a record high, likely surpassing 18m shares shorted as of now. 205m shares outstanding. Billionaire CEO/Founder Wes Edens controls 36% and has never taken any wage while running NFE since creating it a decade ago. Other insiders hold 12%. Institutional ownership controls 48-52%. Yes, that's 98%-100% of all shares. I don't think there's more than 4-6m shares worth of supply below $25 at the moment. Fundamentally the stock is beyond dirt cheap here, shorts are crowded (short ratio sits at over 10.00 now), and there should be positive news flow and a very positive reaction for the stock once Altamira loads its first LNG cargo in the next few days. Next catalyst after that will be earnings on 8/7. I expect management to provide strong guidance for the final two quarters as well as 2025 and beyond. 

Once the stock closes back above $22.50 I expect it to rally rapidly back towards $25-27 before retesting and reclaiming the 50DMA around $30-31. The Board of Directors has previously discussed and considered a share buyback while the stock was above $30. The CEO has seen his net worth take a \~$770m hit since Q1 ER due to fears of another delay for Altamira. Even if I tried, I don't think I could come up with a better scenario: a severely undervalued stock, with a billionaire insider/founder holding such a large stake, ahead of multiple positive catalysts, with the highest level of shorts ever, in an industry like this with near endless demand for cheap North American sourced LNG.

Given this setup I wouldn't be surprised if the stock is back above $40 before September. BoD aim to increase the dividend once the balance sheet is deleveraged further with a target of at least 40% of FCF. Based on 2025's $6-7 FFO, that leaves the future potential dividend yield at 12-15% now.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/YKUlHYLOOj

To all the people who are concerned about me, I’m honestly doing alright now, thanks I appreciate your concern. I paid back that margin owed over the past few years and I have put this chapter behind me. It really sucked and I sincerely wish no one ever goes through something like this. 

But most of you asked if I had any lessons learned from my trading debacle. These are my personal thoughts and you can agree or disagree, I do not care.

NO there is no TL;DR.

1. Only invest the amount you’re okay losing or the amount you won’t be needing for the next 2-3 years

2. Do not trade options unless you really understand it well, or unless you want to simply gamble. Learn about the Greeks, and IV CRUSH AROUND EARNINGS. Buying both sides of the trade is no guarantee you’ll make money.

3. Always take gains (small consistent gains are better than chasing 10 baggers in the long run)

4. Cut your losers early (do not average down like a regard)

5. Being an options seller is somewhat better in the long run

6. Long term mindset is the way to go

7. There’s always another play

8. No shame in quitting trading if you are not doing well

9. Never enable margin trading. Trade with your own cash (and limit that cash to point 1)

10. You can hunt for value plays, but there are certain value plays that can make or break your portfolio. Mine broke my portfolio 

11. Do not chase a hype train, unless you really believe it’s the next best thing in the world

12. NEVER look back and see what a trade you have already exited would’ve been, this one thing will mess with all your future trades. If you’ve exited, just move on, don’t keep tracking it thinking it would’ve netted you another 100% or so

I will edit the post to add more points if I remember them.

100,1dxlz3o,2024-07-07 17:33:10,[DD] Invest in Cyberpunk Dystopia with Electric Quadcopters. Urban Air Mobility Sector set to take off.,"edit: in case my dystopian joke opening was toooo pithy, the rest of the post does have a serious thesis.

A review of near-future science fiction media (Westworld, Bladerunner, Cyberpunk 2077, etc) reveals that electric VTOL aircraft capable of maneuvering and landing in tight urban airspaces will be in great demand and common use for corporate overlords and quasi-fascist law enforcement organizations. Fortunately, these aircraft actually exist! Now is the time to invest in them to be oligarchs instead of serfs in our future dystopia!

Electric Vertical Aircraft (eVTOL) is a speculative tech sector that is gaining momentum for an explosive breakout. I suspect it will soon follow a pattern like satellite comms (ASTS, GSAT), AI, Fintech, Cloud everything, Cybersecurity, and EVs, with extreme valuation fluctuations as companies push from speculative to operational, and some “winners” emerging by 2026 with sustained major value increases.

Human-piloted and fully AI-piloted eVTOLs will land at “vertiports” in cities, on airport, skyscraper, and resort helipads, and rapidly deploy QRFs to quell rebels dissenting against corporate feudalism. eVTOLs aim to greatly expand the use of “Air Taxis” and regional/urban air transport options for small cargo, people, and other tasks.

*Disclaimer: obviously, I might be an idiot since I post here, so consider that before buying anything based on this analysis. Also I wrote this before seeing someone else posted about this today.*

*Also, I'm using ""EVTOL"" here to avoid the Electric Vertical Aircraft acronym from triggering as a banned ticker.*

&nbsp;

**BLUF: Main Thesis**

*The eVTOL and particularly the UAM sector is primed to be re-valued from high-risk speculation to operational, revenue generating business. Valuations currently depressed by fear due to significant schedule uncertainty and technology questions will rise rapidly into speculative hype as clear timelines emerge and probability of successful operations increases.*

* While eVTOL future is uncertain, options gamblers should love this as a month-long play with high potential to break out, even if we see retracing afterwards.

* Multiple companies spiked on announcements last summer, but retraced as dilution and timeline risk re-emerged.

* This summer, companies have provided more concrete timelines and test successes, and announced an end to dilution as they have cash or revenue to sustain until full operations.

* Getting in now will front-run the overall sector value increase as risk-averse investors become willing to buy. In the short term, continued milestone achievements will bring immediate hype (10-baggers?) through summer ERs and EOY, and set the stage for sustainable operations over the next 2-3 years.

* Segment analysis has CAGR between 25-50% from now through the next decade, depending on the exact parameters and time of analysis.

* EVTOLs are marketed as ""green"" aviation and may become part of the push away from fossil fuels as battery and engine efficiency continues to increase.

* Hype-wise, financial and general articles about the segment have ramped up considerably over the last month. Getting in now will also front run my suspicion that one or more eVTOL startups will go on a ""meme"" run before the end of summer. 

* AI-piloted eVTOL are unlikely to run you into highway barriers at full speed, unlike FSD, as there are fewer things to hit in the sky.

* This post is already long AF and I cut out a ton of supporting research and ticker-specific analysis so I could meme about dystopias and autopilot. Will post more details and information on request.

&nbsp;

**BLUF: Archer Aviation ($ACHR) calls are the “I can’t read, what do I buy” play**

Yeah you’re not here for a sector DD, don’t care about buying shares of multiple companies, wen lambo?!…

**If you want to pick one gambling play, I would go with ACHR 4.5 or 5c, expiry 8/15 (extreme risk due to thin volume) or 10/18 (better volume).** ACHR closed at ~$4.4 on Friday, up from $3.46 on Monday. Next ER is 8/8.

Archer is on a major upswing, trading higher on about double its average volume over the last week. They’ve announced they have sufficient cash to achieve FAA Type certification for their “Midnight” airframe *(no more dilution!),* have other relevant certs in place, and confirmed their first market is rich San Francisco. Last summer ACHR went to $7.22/share before retracing on uncertain certification timeline and cash risks, issues which are now resolved. Market size, concrete business plans, an outrageously large OI of more than 100,000 calls for 10/18 5c, and current trajectory mimicking last summer suggest a return to at least that level soon. As a previous SPAC, early ~~investors~~ bagholders (me lol) get ROI at a price above $10/share and PT average is $8.1, so institutions and major holders shouldn’t begin profit-taking until those marks. I don’t think short interest is relevant but FWIW if it helps you hype yourself up, it's quite high at 26% of float, due to the high risk speculative nature of the company.

As with all plays that cover an ER, I would **strongly** consider selling or at least rolling up to extract profits pre-ER if the price continues to rise and you are sitting on good profits.

I'd also caution against only trying one play here, as ACHR is currently running but may not be ""the play"" by EOY still.

&nbsp;

**Sector Brief: Startups/Majors/Up/Downstream in UAM**

I own, or will soon buy shares or long dated options across all mentioned startups, Bell, and air mobility.  I think buying a spread of shares in IRA/Retirement ports across the segment is a good idea. Note I've dropped the tickers from small-caps to avoid getting a slap from VisualMod, but you should be able to find them by name.

* **Publicly traded startups:** Archer Aviation (ACHR), JOBY, Vertical Aerospace (UK), Lilium, EHANG (EH, Chinese), and EVEX (Embraer spinoff)

* **Major Aerospace:** Bell/Textron (TXT) who acquired Pipistrel, and Airbus (EADSF)

* **Upstream Suppliers:** “pick and shovel” investments (Batteries, Infrastructure) are not likely to experience significant effects from the eVTOL market yet. The ground EV market is already significantly bigger and more impactful to suppliers.

* **Downstream:** “Air Mobility” companies that offer helicopter services may experience bumps as they expand and market new more affordable eVTOL services to a wider audience. Blade Air Mobility (US) and Bristow Group (UK) are publicly traded.

* **ETFs** I have not found a dedicated ETF for this sector. BATW and (uh oh) ARKX have the highest exposure, but percentages are too small for them to mimic the sector as a whole.

* **Private Startups** Volocopter, Beta, and Wisk have good sales pipelines and revenue commitments. Keep an eye out for IPO or merger.

* Finally, some major players like Boeing may be active in spaces more related to military/niche segments that are harder to isolate by ticker or project eVTOL-specific gains.

&nbsp;

**Upcoming Calls on ERs for Mansion or GUH**

The next round of ERs occurs from very late July to August, but Option Volume is thin for dates other than quarterly expiration (mostly October).  These are the 3 most advanced startups, plus Bell Helicopter:

* ACHR as described above (4.5 or 5c 8/16 or 10/18)

* **JOBY 8/2 5c or 6c (extreme risk, thinly traded) or 10/18 7c (better volume/time).** JOBY is the most mature of the startups and has operating contracts in Dubai. They acquired Uber's attempt at eVTOL service several years ago.

* **EH 8/16 16c or 17c (Chinese company, extremely risky ER play, they have a 29 PT though).** It's Chinese, could do anything.

* **TXT 7/19 95c (very risky ER play, but they have a 100 PT).** Established, major Helicopter manufacturer, bought an eVTOL startup to jump ahead on production.

**Longer Dated high risk, high reward options plays (through Jan ’25 or beyond)**

* Vertical Aerospace 1/17/2025 2.5c.  Vertical had a flight test crash last summer that the valuation hasn’t recovered from. Good news before EOY should multiply the stock price.

* Lilium 10/18 1c or Jan ’25 1c. Really risky because Lilium’s Jet is still very early in design, but they’re actively publishing successful tests which could push these ITM as the sector valuation goes up across the board. Might be a sleeper smash hit for mid '25.

* EVEX – bad options chain, but consider 8/16 2.5c to play their ER as they may announce they will not do any more equity dilution after the current equity offer at $4/share and leverage the increase from the current 3.3 price to the $4 equity offering price.

&nbsp;

**Drawbacks/counterpoints**

* Certification may still take much longer than predicted. A Risk-averse FAA, failures during flight tests, and other issues may suddenly and unexpectedly push back viability by years.

* The predicted market may not emerge. The eVTOL use cases have a high-risk combination of needing to take share from fossil fuel helicopters and generate significant increases in the general usage of point-to-point “Air Taxi” service.

* Risk-averse institutional investors may wait until 2026 to pour in cash, when startups have proven operations and revenue streams.

* Major players like Textron/Bell and Airbus, privately held companies like Volocopter, and market share staying diffuse amongst many competitors may mean value increases are small for any given company.

* The sector may not generate the same hype as other speculative techs, causing no “meme” spikes in the short term.

**Positions** yeah they’re not huge but my gambling port and individual investment IRA are deliberately smaller to keep me from losing everything.

I invest in what I know and/or like and/or trust, and that I think is currently trading at a good valuation. In fact two of my better recent investments were $NVEI and $CJT. I'm up 25% on $NVEI in only a few months, and the basis of my DD for investing was I heard Ryan Reynolds invested in it. And I'm up 22% on $CJT in a few weeks only, and that was based on the student investment club at my alma mater recommending it in a case competition that they won.

So with that disclaimer in mind, my latest investment in $BCE. What's my rationale? It is a blue chip, very stable Canadian company. $40b market cap in an industry dominated by a few players only. It is currently trading at a 5 year low, so this is about as cheap as you can get it. And because of that you also pick up an almost 10% dividend yield on it!!! If I can get something blue chip paying a 10% yield at a discounted price, I'm happy to sit on this at these lows, collect a good dividend, and wait for the market to strength and valuations start to rise back up at least to historical levels if not more. And even if they don't rise, I'm still getting my 10% dividend and I'm happy with that.

It’s been awhile since I had to give up stocks and trading since I pretty much lost everything I had. Not the worst out there but considering I pretty much never had seen that much money before this was a substantial amount for me to bear and pretty much knocked me out of the game for awhile. I made some pretty dumb plays; trying to trade at work or on my 15 minute breaks, invested in bad penny stocks ( an EV stock)  lmfao, and overall I learned a good amount so if the day comes where I can get back into the market I’ll be more focused on investing in indexes and setting a small portion for trading on the side. Hats off to whoever made it successfully day trading. How long did it take for you to become successful and how much did you need to lose before that?

An add-on for Congress might be to require pre-clearance requests be made public on a central website 24h hours before being allowed to execute, if granted permission to trade by SEC ethics staff.

SEC staff have outright bans on options and many individual stocks, holding period requirements, required pre-clearnace of trades, etc., all of which extend to staff members' spouses and dependent children. 

This isn't rocket science.

- Anthropic's Claude 3.5 is shitting all over OpenAI's stuff right now. Amazon might've backed the right horse here, and nobody's talking about it.
- AWS is already the 800-pound gorilla in cloud. Lots of compute to leverage for AI (nobody's bigger than them).
- Amazon's obviously got a lot of cash to snag top AI talent. 
- The whole AGI race. I wouldn't bet against Amazon pulling some Skynet-level shit out of nowhere. I'm also long the other big tech because of this thesis too, however.

- Victims' Families: Calling it a ""sweetheart deal"" and pushing for a trial.

Here’s the lowdown:

- Reputation: Can Boeing shake off this PR disaster, or is their brand forever tainted? Are we talking Titanic-level sinking, or can they pull a Houdini?
- Financials: Will the fine and potential legal battles sink their ship, or do they have the cash reserves to weather this storm?
- Stock Price: Will accepting the deal bring stability and investor confidence, or will the backlash make $BA nosedive? If they reject it, are we looking at courtroom drama that could send the stock into freefall?

They published 8 papers in 2022. Meanwhile NVIDIA published MORE THAN 100.

And if you have any academic background in Computer Science or Computer Engineering, you will know that how frequent you will pop into a NVIDIA research for your studies.

This also shows us why their products are superiour and at least two generations ahead of their competition.

And this also shows us that why they will BUILD on that lead. Recent Blackwell announcement is also a hint on that. They are selling Datacenters costing MILLIONS of dollars per unit.

Please understand that.

Every time this subject comes up it devolves into discussion about the future of satellite radio and which streaming app is best.  That's not the idea here.

If you want to buy SIRI (or hold it) when we're done that's another story.  (I'll include info on why you might in the comments.  I'm sure we can all supply reasons to be bearish.)

This is a short term trade involving two Liberty Media tickers.

The tickers are LSXMA and LSXMK (I may refer to them as LSXM- when I'm saying something that applies equally to both.)

# [Sometime ""early this quarter"" every share of LSXM- is going to transform into 8.4 shares of SIRI.](https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/522/liberty-media-and-siriusxm-announce-transaction-to-simplify)

(Since I just mentioned SIRI let me once again remind you that this trade is not about satellite radio or Pandora.)

[SIRI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SIRI/) closed at $3.53 on 3 July.  Since the market is always efficient that means that LSXM- closed at exactly $29.65.

LSXM- is trading at a 23% discount compared to its value in SIRI shares.

If SIRI holds at $3.53 and you own LSXM-, you can sell it all on the day the shares convert for a 23% profit.  If SIRI rises by the time of the conversion you'll make more.  If it falls by then you'll make less. << *This is  oversimplified*

I suspect it will hold or rise.

I'll leave my reasons for that in my comment below so we can skip the ""Howard Stern is sus"" comments (he definitely is, that's his schtick), the ""I can't afford a car with a radio"" comments (no shame in that, cars are expensive) and get to picking apart this play.

# Part two: the options are calling.

For some reason LSXM- has been ignored compared to SIRI, and that includes its option chain.

[Take a look at the IV on SIRI calls for Aug 16.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SIRI/options/?type=calls&date=1723766400)

I picked that date because it's the middle of the quarter and the deal should be done by then or at least close enough that arbitrageurs are closing the gap.  At the time of writing the ATM calls are showing 99% IV.

[Now look at LSXMK calls for the same date.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SIRI/options/?type=calls&date=1723766400)

At the time of writing the IV for ATM calls is 52% and the last sold price is $1.25.  **But wait! What's truly ATM right now?** The price of LSXMK or the price of (SIRI \* 8.4)? If the latter, then the true ATM strike is $29 and the last sold price is 10¢.

When those shares convert you'll be holding ATM calls on SIRI with a lot size of 840 shares and a cost basis of 10¢ per share.

If you think the merger will take longer to complete or that SIRI may be worth owning after the discount then the leaps may be an even better deal.

The $28 strike last sold for 55¢ with an IV of 57%.  But that gives you almost 5X the amount of time to figure out what to do with it plus $1 lower strike.

Given the time he started buying I think arbitrage is exactly what he had in mind.  The stocks have dropped since then.  Maybe they will buy more since the discount has opened up again, maybe they have all they want.  I don't know.

Does the good news with this company ever stop?

Anyway, key point of the article imo:

_The latest move appears to be a part of CEO Masayoshi Son’s broader plan to position SoftBank as a leader in AI technology, for which it has started discussions with banks about borrowing money to fund up to $10 billion in energy-related projects driven by AI demand, The Information reported on Thursday._

And then this little nugget which is an entirely new concept to me for banks:

_SoftBank, a backer of companies like Tencent, T Mobile, 10x Genomics (NASDAQ:TXG), and Automation Anywhere, among others, could look to create a special-purpose company to purchase the GPUs with borrowed funds, and would then lease the GPUs to SoftBank, allowing the firm to keep the debt off its balance sheet._

I don't understand the reason for the drop and think it could present a buying opportunity for all the same reasons BOA said. It has potential to be an S&P 500 addition and could see a nice boost in revenue (and hopefully margins) this quarter from their Al servers/computer sales. I've been talking about Dell a lot since their last earnings caused the stock to dive and finally thought my analysis was being realized until it wasn't. Would appreciate any thoughts as I'm still pretty new to this.

https://www.ft.com/content/b76ef55b-21cd-498b-ac16-5660908bb8d2

_Nvidia is on course to sell $12bn worth of artificial intelligence chips in China this year despite US export controls that have throttled its business in one of the world’s biggest semiconductor markets.
The $3tn Silicon Valley group will over the coming months deliver more than 1mn of its new H20 chips, which are designed to fall outside of US restrictions on selling AI processors to Chinese customers, according to analyst forecasts._

_That figure is almost twice as many as Huawei is expected to sell of its China-made rival product, Ascend 910B, according to estimates from SemiAnalysis, a chip consultancy._

_Nvidia is the latest Silicon Valley company to find itself entangled in tensions between Washington and Beijing. The Biden administration wants to stem the flow of the world’s most powerful chips to China, fearing Beijing may use them to create more powerful AI systems with military applications._

_The resulting shortage of AI chips has hit the ability of Chinese tech groups such as ByteDance, Tencent and Alibaba to compete with US-based OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta and Google in a technology that is reshaping the industry._

_Each H20 chip costs between $12,000 and $13,000, suggesting that Nvidia is likely to generate upwards of $12bn in sales. That would be more than the $10.3bn revenue made from its entire China business — including selling graphics chips to PC gamers and other products — in the financial year ending in January 2024._

_Nvidia declined to comment on the forecasts. Huawei did not respond to a request for comment.
Ever since the Biden administration first introduced restrictions on Nvidia’s ability to sell its most powerful AI chips in China in 2022, the US company has warned that its business would suffer as cloud computing providers and AI start-ups there turned to local alternatives such as Huawei._

_“Our business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, said during the company’s most recent earnings call in May. “And it’s a lot more competitive in China now, because of the limitations on our technology . . . However, we continue to do our best to serve the customers in the markets there.”
Colette Kress, Nvidia’s finance chief, said on the same call that revenue from its data centre segment — which includes AI chips — in China in the latest quarter was “down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October”._

_As recently as 2021, before the US began imposing export controls, China accounted for more than a quarter of Nvidia’s total revenues. Even if the H20 chip sells as well as analysts expect, China could be closer to 10 per cent of sales this year. But that also reflects the huge growth that Nvidia is seeing from US tech companies as they build out ever-larger AI systems._

_Although Nvidia’s sales in China have been lower ahead of the rollout of the new H20 this spring, analysts at both Morgan Stanley and SemiAnalysis say that the chip is now being shipped in volume and is proving popular with Chinese customers, despite its downgraded performance compared with the chips Nvidia can sell in the US._

_“Buyers report positive feedback on the potential competitiveness of H20 clusters,” Morgan Stanley wrote in a research note to clients this week, pointing to “strong China demand”._

190,1dva89a,2024-07-04 15:54:44, TSLA and deliverables: Elon and his history of polished products.,"Let me start by saying I love the IDEA of Tesla. Back in 2016-2017 when they announced the Model 3, a beautiful, eco-friendly electric car that was affordable, I was so excited and wanted to put in a pre-order despite not knowing the full cost.

Lo and behold, there were delays.

When FSD was hyped, and the concept of fully autonomous driving was the main selling point, it reignited my enthusiasm. Over a 6 years later (1) autonomous cars still require attentiveness and are far from the “car drive themselves” level promised by Musk, even with massive amounts of investment, programmers etc. at his disposal at the time (he has since significantly reduced his work force). What’s worse is he has removed LiDAR, and believes you just need eyes and a brain… yet any basic science undergraduate can tell you the difference between the macula vs peripheral vision, and draw a simple analogy between cameras and LiDAR. A choice, I think, was a mistake.

He unveiled smart summon, a pretty amazing feature in theory, and fundamental to robotaxi, but it seems even Tesla owners don’t use it because it is buggy (2). Which may be a hint at how far off autonomous ride hailing could be— competitors like Waymo, which are solely focused on this technology have advanced considerably but not making such bold claims it seems, because they are grounded in reality. Bugs, glitches, and a lack of true intuitive humanness/user experience (3).

That leaves us with Robotaxi and Optimus. No doubt these are *in theory* incredible advancements, but what timeline, in reality, should we expect for these? Will the world be massively disappointed yet again? Or is this the turning point for TSLA and its ability to live up to its lofty ambitions? 

TL;DR
Elon will always have a reach further than his grasp. Are we just getting jerked around?

196,1dv7nq7,2024-07-04 14:01:37,Just Do It and Buy Some NKE Calls,"Yes, I know the metallic taste lingers in everyone's mouth from the recent earnings decline. While this downturn may have impacted your portfolio, I believe the current bottom floor is an excellent opportunity. I honestly think this could be the biggest trading opportunity this year.

First things first: Nike has faced a few obstacles that need to be addressed. Nike's expected revenue fell short in Q4 2024, coming in at $12.6 billion compared to $12.9 billion. The 2% year-over-year decline is driven by an 8% drop in direct-to-consumer sales (Nike-owned stores). This decline, paired with less-than-ideal guidance, dampened investor spirits, leaving us with NKE at a price **unseen since 2020**. Rarely do we see a blue-chip stock present an entry opportunity like this. The best part? We have a worldwide marketing event beginning in 22 days. **Hence, I believe this is an ideal position to springboard towards 50x, perhaps even 100x profits**.

Nike is an elite shoe and sportswear company. The market overreacted to EPS reports and oversold. Now, we can take advantage of the largest single-day drop in the company's history to secure an excellent position. Nike isn't going anywhere. While Hoka and ON footwear are currently outperforming Nike, the latter remains head and shoulders above these companies. Nike boasts half a century of experience in this industry and is known for continuous innovation with products like Flyknit, Air Max, and React. The company has a significant global presence, reaching over 190 countries, and extends its influence beyond sports into popular culture through high-profile endorsements and sponsorships. This global influence is what I believe will yield the most profits.

The Summer Olympics are around the corner: July 26 - August 11. Nike has long been a prominent sponsor and supplier of the event, dating back to 1972. This enhances its global visibility and prestige. Comparing Nike to Hoka, ON, or even Lululemon is like comparing Coke to Dr. Pepper. You will never see these companies come close to replacing a giant like Nike in sponsoring major global events. Historically, Nike's stock has responded positively to the Olympics due to increased brand exposure and elite athletic association. Specifically, with every NKE earnings release preceding a major sporting event, the stock declined 75% of the time. Before the 2012 London Olympics, Nike shares fell 9%. Before 2008 Beijing? Yep, fell 10%. During and after the Olympics, we can expect to see positive movement. As such, I believe a price target of $90 is reasonable. This will boost investor confidence and transform this challenging period into a golden opportunity.

This one was falling to the 200 day moving average on the 1 day period chart  After it Cycled through all the other common smaller moving averages making the smaller dips . As the crypto grew  It dipped down to previous smaller moving averages in order such as the 100 day was the previous dip and 50 day was the dip before that. Et cetera.  In my opinion it should be done now that it hit it. And then it will cycle through all of the Moving average periods again as it rises and this time the final big dip will be when it falls to the 200 day moving average on the 1 week chart. That will be the big crash at the end of the bull market.  That's just my opinion and not advice. I seem to see this pattern roughly in many charts but who knows I could be crazy. LOL

Included for the first time were projections for electricity consumption associated with data centers, cryptocurrency, and artificial intelligence.

This usage represented almost 2 percent of global energy demand in 2022 — and that demand for these uses could double by 2026, which would make it roughly equal to the amount of electricity used by the entire country of Japan.

We live in the digital age, where many of the processes that guide our lives are hidden from us inside computer code. We are watched by machines behind the scenes that bill us when we cross toll bridges, guide us across the internet, and deliver us music we didn’t even know we wanted. All of this takes material to build and run — plastics, metals, wiring, water — and all of that comes with costs.

As the world heats up toward increasingly dangerous temperatures and with governments agreeing on net zero targets we should be able to capitalise on a market that I think will be probably booming relatively soon.

I have been using $LIF since 2020 because my 3 siblings used it and wanted me to share locations with them. It wasn't really on my mind since I didn't trade back then but come to 2023 when I'm in freshman year of college, every person is using it other than find my iPhone for locations. Life360 seems to be the most applicable app for location sharing among families or friends due to it being available on both Android and Apple. When the IPO occurred I talked to my sister who is still in highschool if she likes life360 and she told me she bought the premium subscription for it. Therefore leading me to my bull thesis and deeper due diligence.

**Fundamentals**

The balance sheet if looking back since 2020 seems pretty strong with cash and equivalents being greater than the total debt, therefore meaning won't go bust in the face of economic downturn. The total assets were also increasing since 2020 up to 2023 along with the debt decreasing or coming back to about what is was in 2020 in 2023.

The losses are decreasing yoy, the revenue from both service and hardware is increasing yoy, and therefore the losses are shrinking yoy.

I have discovered while doing my research that LIF owns Tile and Jiobit. Tile seems to be around a lot if you look for them while talking to people. Their brand isn't just the app but also physical products as well which shows they are expanding.

**Technical**

The trend beings displayed is upwards in the daily charts.

**Narrative**

Based on my readings about Peter Lynch's trading ideology and the idea of narrative economics by Robert J. Shiller, here is my narrative.

People in my daily life are using life360 all around me and I see their products in people's wallets and keys. Even I use the products they have and my sister buys their subscription service. My girlfriends whole family uses it as well. In a quick summary, everybody uses it and people who didn't use it are starting to because it is a ""trend."" This seems to fit the ideology about having a good story by Peter Lynch.

However, to add more on to this; there is way more to the narrative. The trend has already started and people are willing to pay for a free app to get more benefits out of it and a lot of times guys who use it or never used it don't really care about it. What is one thing every guy will do as they get older of just live? They will start dating and getting partners. Along with a growing want for safety with location sharing, the girlfriends of the boyfriends would want them to have a location sharing app and especially if they have differing phone brands it increases the need for a universal location sharing product. Even families will want location sharing for family safety which means the consumers are not just teenagers or young adults but older people as well.

The growth of the usage of the app seems pretty dang expansive and with our world become more integrated with technology and people's willingness to buy subscriptions, the business seems to be just at the start of growing bigger. Since subscriptions aren't as easily noticeable by the buyer like a physical product, they will be less inclined to consider it a big expense and keep it steady which equals continuous profit. As long as people want a universal app for safety, this company can provide for as long as possible.

I am not sure if they are allowed to sell data, but they could also seel that data for AI purposes down the line since AI is starting to hit a barrier where they are running out of data to train it with.

Additionally, life360 has a social media presence and in my experience, a sns presence equates to a growing company. The feelings of the mass that is displayed in social media such as tiktok or instragram also provides a good idea on if the stock is doing good or bad at the moment.

**Position and NOT FA**

IDK how to post multiple images on here so I will just comment by position. My position isn't that big but it is about 83% of my portfolio because I am broke.

**TLDR**

Fundamentals and technical analysis is good. The company seems to be able to expand more. The stock tells a good narrative. If following socials, life360 has a positive and growing vibe around it. I have a big position in regards to my portfolio size. Not FA.",10,0.73

228,1duqpbi,2024-07-03 22:07:49,$DIS Disney is at a once in a decade buying opportunity,"This is the weekly chart for $DIS. Each candle represents one week of trading and the chart goes back to 2010.

https://preview.redd.it/1wqkuxf0ldad1.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&s=33e19b58c9f5fa193d355ad551aca96a5061c85c

$DIS has been in a clear uptrend for more than a decade, until the 2022 bear market showed up, inflation and the mini recession wrecked the stock market and $DIS in particular. 

The dark green line is the 80-week moving average. Which represents the average weekly closing price of the last 80 weeks.   
Whenever this moving average is trending up, the equity in question is in an uptrend and vice versa.

Notice how the moving average trended down for nearly two years between 2022 and 2024.

Since the beginning of the year it flattened and has actually been slowly curling up.

Once price breaks above this moving average and comes back to it, it's called a breakout and backtest setup.

This is an incredibly bullish setup with high odds of success. It gives buyers one final chance of entering after the first major breakout.

Now I want you to take a closer look at the volume. Notice how weekly volume has actually been declining as the price has been dropping throughout the last 3 months. This is exactly what you want to see. You want to see sellers less and less interested as the price drops and then you want to see volume expand once buyers are back in and price is trending higher.

ENTRY :  
Now, let's talk about timing the entry. Let's take a look at the zoomed-in portion in pink.  
You will notice that $DIS has a tendency to form a bull flag / bull penant / wedge structure and as soon as price breaks above the resistance level of this structure the stock rallies for several weeks.

Right now we are in the middle of a 3rd one of these structures that hasn't broken out yet. The objective entry would be on the first breakout of this structure if you're looking to trade this aggressively.

Personally. I'm quite happy with the 80-week backtest and I don't want to wait for the breakout so I can buy it here while it's cheap..

TARGET :  
If the stock simply retraces back to the middle of its long-term uptrending channel. That would translate to a rally upwards of $160 by the end of next year.

The December 2025 $120 leap call options are trading at $7.3. That means if the $160 target is realized by the end of 2025, those options will net $40 in profit. a 550% gain in 18 months.  
If the price target is realized earlier, those options will net even higher profit. And if $DIS exceeds this price target, again those gains would be much higher.  
I like the Dec 2025 $120 calls because the far out expiration drastically reduces this risk of theta decay, and gives this setup plenty of time to realize the price target.

Keep in mind that the full-measured move from this consolidation pattern actually puts $DIS at $150 by the end of this year. Which can return an excess of 2000% given how cheap the call options currently are. Just beware of the risk if you're trading this year's Dec expirations.

Good luck regards.

Historical Performance of QQQ in July: Historically, July has been a strong month for the QQQ. Given this historical trend, I expect the bullish momentum in QQQ to influence Tesla’s price movement.

Capital Rotation from NVIDIA to Other Stocks: The recent surge in NVIDIA’s stock has captured significant investor interest. As the stock market operates in cycles, I anticipate a capital rotation where investors move profits from one high-performing stock to others. With NVIDIA’s impressive rally, it’s likely that investors will take profits and seek opportunities in other promising tech stocks like Tesla. This influx of capital can drive Tesla’s stock price higher. 

Combined FOMO from Robotaxi Event, Optimus, and Earnings: Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi event, the developments around Tesla Optimus, and its earnings report are all highly anticipated. The FOMO on potentially groundbreaking announcements related to Tesla’s advancements in autonomous driving technology and the Tesla Optimus robot, combined with the anticipation of positive earnings results, can create substantial buying pressure.

I’ll keep you all updated as you tell me I’m wrong, I’ve only just started trading last month with $500, but I’ve been able to grow it pretty fast with NVIDIA puts and Tesla calls :)

The position reports are hard to visualize b/c there are a lot of trades but the normal trade is to hedge options with contracts until price moves in the right direction then drop the hedge since slippage is much less with contracts. Sometimes, I do the reverse and buy cheaper OTM options in order to buy more contracts. Number of contracts is usually determined by delta of option with a little yolo mixed in at times.

This meant that there is still a chance to buy SMCI while the shares are cheap right before they release their earnings in a month. The reason why im bullish on SMCI is because AI is driving the stock to skyrocket as they work alongside Nvidia and AMD in providing data centres. Elon musk had also catapulted the stock to reach over $1000 as he had tweeted that he is partnering with Dell and SMCI to provide AI data centres for its generative AI chatbot.

Eli Lilly announced that the drug is suitable for adults with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and will improve the currently limited treatment options available to U.S. patients suffering from this brain-wasting disease.

""This is real progress,"" said Joanne Pike, president and CEO of the Alzheimer's Association. ""Tuesday's approval allows people more options and greater opportunity to have more time.""

According to Alzheimer's Association data, nearly 7 million Americans suffer from this disease, which is the fifth leading cause of death among adults over 65 in the United States. By 2050, the number of patients in the U.S. is expected to reach nearly 13 million.

For Eli Lilly, this approval marks a long-anticipated victory, as it signifies the end of a tumultuous approval process for donanemab. In early 2023, the FDA had rejected accelerated approval for the drug based on early trial results, instructing Lilly to submit more trial data. After Lilly provided the additional data, the FDA unexpectedly delayed approval again in March this year.

It wasn't until last month that the drug received the green light from an FDA advisory panel, leading to FDA approval finally being granted on Tuesday.

Anne White, president of Eli Lilly Neuroscience, stated in an interview, ""There's a lot of emotion in the hallways today.""

Following the regulatory approval, donanemab will face direct competition from Leqembi, an Alzheimer's treatment developed by Japan's Eisai and America's Biogen. Leqembi had already received FDA approval last summer and has been gradually rolling out in the U.S.

Within the industry, both donanemab and Leqembi are considered milestone drugs in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Both are monoclonal antibodies targeting toxic substances called amyloid plaques in the brain, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's, to slow disease progression in early-stage patients.

However, donanemab has shown better efficacy compared to Leqembi. According to a late-stage trial, donanemab slowed cognitive decline by 35% compared to the placebo group. After reaching certain targets for amyloid plaque clearance, patients could end treatment and switch to a placebo at 6, 12, or 18 months.",10,0.73

They have overblown the digital risks for BYND and they have negative sentiment about the company that can be seen by the huge short interest. The value of BYND is overlooked. Every time I go to the store this product is selling great and they introduce new variations of the product.

If BYND fails and goes bankrupt the people that work there will loose their job and the millionaire/billionaire hedge fund people that bet against this company will make a huge profit. We the people can take back the power and help this company be successful by investing in BYND. I know the overall share price wave has decreased since they went public in 2019; however, I personally believe this company is an underdog company that will have a great comeback story that will go in the Wall Street history books with an upward trending wave.

272,1duggni,2024-07-03 14:59:50,ZIM: Let's go again!,"I believe ZIM will soar to at least $40 (x2), maybe more, in the next 4-6 weeks. Here’s why:

**Market Situation**

1. **Container Shipping Rates:** They’ve skyrocketed and show no signs of stopping.
2. **Red Sea Drama:** With the Red Sea routes disrupted, ships are taking the scenic route around Africa. This requires 10-12% more ships, absorbing last year’s new builds and most of the upcoming new fleet.
3. **Container Chaos:** More ships mean more disorganized containers. Shippers hate waiting for empty containers, leaving them at destination ports.
4. **Tariff Tango:** Biden’s tariff increases have importers scrambling to ship earlier than the usual August-October peak. Inventories are low after years of adjustments.
5. **Trump’s Tariff Tease:** With Trump promising additional tariffs, companies are likely to import more now to avoid future costs. It’s like a retail apocalypse, but for shipping!

Rates logically going up

**Zim Shipping**

1. **Big Player:** ZIM is the 10th largest shipping company, mostly leasing boats but owning a few.
2. **Volatile Market:** Shipping is ultra-competitive. When companies make money, they all buy boats, leading to oversupply, like in 2023.
3. **Red Sea Plans:** Like others, ZIM expects Red Sea issues to ease and rates to drop with a large supply of new vessels by year-end.
4. **Management’s Gloomy Outlook:** Despite being insiders, ZIM’s management didn’t foresee the recent rate spikes and forecasted a tough year-end during earnings calls.
5. **Genius Move:** ZIM didn’t contract volume for their fleet this year, a rarity. Normally, 70% is contracted to limit volatility, but this year, 65% operates on spot rates, which are currently exploding. They avoided low rates proposed by customers expecting a drop. I don't know if this was thought through but I only care about the result, a genuis move!

**Reasons to Believe**

1. **FOMO & Tariff Talk:** Supply chain directors are ordering because they are seeing chaos coming and don't want to loss their job. For COVID-19, they had a good excuse, but this time, they will be asked to explain why they bragged last year and have nothing to sale this year. Panic buying is imminent if rates hit $8K in August. Funny, right? Not so much for them.
2. **Shanghai-LA Route:** ZIM has 30% of their fleet here. Spot rates are at $6,6K, up from Q1’s $1.9K.
3. **Printing Money:** ZIM made a killing in 2021 and 2022 when shipping was underestimated. Wall Street will catch on.
4. **Q2 Earnings:** ZIM will likely post $600-800M in Q2. Estimates are lower due to delivery payment arguments, but surcharges could boost earnings. Q3 could see $1.2-1.5B if rates stabilize and I am not talking if they goes to 10k.
5. **Undervalued:** We're talking about $2B in two quarters for a company valued at $2.6B. With 11% short interest, the market’s in for a surprise.

**Counter Arguments**

1. **Red Sea Resolved:** Sure, Middle Eastern politics will magically stabilize in 2-3 months (sarcasm intended). And the whole situation has nothing to do with Russian/Iran and co. Everybody wants the peace especially the houtis
2. **Rates Drop:** Absolutely, Americans will suddenly stop buying because they are planning to save money when the stock market is at all time high. And shipping remains the world's cheapest option to import cheap China goods even at $10K per container. And China needs to export.
3. **Huge Debt:** ZIM’s $5.3B debt includes lease obligations for the next 5-8 years. It’s like counting Microsoft’s electricity bills for the next 8 years as debt. The reality is Zim will likely redistribute around $10-12 of the profit this year.
4. **No change in the Summer:** Possible, but shipping’s peak season starts in August, anticipating post-summer and Black Friday demand. Usually big moves are in the summer for shipping. If you have 6 hours of your life to kill, watch this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KovvaLWBSs4&t=2007s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KovvaLWBSs4&t=2007s) . Ok, I will be nice with you, 5:21:00.

**Conclusion**

The situation isn’t as clear-cut as 2021/2022 when there were no boats. The influx of new vessels will affect rates, but political tariff talk will likely spur cautious, anticipatory corporate actions. Once rates hit $8K in 2-3 weeks, expect a panic buying spree. Buckle up; ZIM might just rocket.",22,0.78
273,1duga9b,2024-07-03 14:52:20,Cathy Wood cut some of her Tesla ( TSLA ) stock and increased her stake in emerging drone maker Archer Aviation ( ACHR ) Is ACHR Worth Watch,"Wood and Ark Invest sold a total of 62,867 shares of Tesla stock on Tuesday, valued at $14.538 million at the closing price of 231.26. Meanwhile, Wood and ARK purchased 406,912 shares of Archer Aviation stock on Tuesday, valued at $1.51 million based on a closing price of 3.72. San Jose-based Archer is developing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for urban environments, with the goal of creating a robust air cab service. Archer Aviation received an additional $55 million investment from Stellantis (STLA) on Tuesday through a strategic financing agreement. Stellantis invested $110 million in Archer in 2023 through a series of open market stock purchases and strategic agreement investments. The investment follows Archer's June 8 completion of a critical test flight of its Midnight aircraft.



On June 5, the company announced that it had received FAA certification to begin operating as a commercial airline, and on June 17, Archer entered into an agreement with Signature Aviation to provide it with access to the world's largest network of private airline terminals. Under the agreement, Archer plans to launch air cab services as early as the end of 2025 at United Airlines (UAL) hubs at Newark International Airport and Chicago O'Hare Airport. The agreement also gives Archer access to takeoff and landing locations in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Texas.



Signature Aviation operates more than 200 private terminals worldwide. According to the company, Archer plans to expand throughout its network as aircraft availability increases.



On June 20, Archer unveiled additional plans to establish an air mobility network at five locations in the San Francisco Bay Area.",11,0.72

Is this the contrarian indicator we are waiting for.

PMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) chief global markets strategist Marko Kolanovic is planning to leave the bank, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing an internal memo it obtained.

Kolanovic is perhaps infamously known for his conflicting stock-market calls over the past two years which have differed significantly from Wall Street's actual performance.

Kolanovic, who according to his LinkedIn profile has been at JPMorgan (JPM) for over 16 years, is ""exploring other opportunities,"" as per the memo as quoted by Bloomberg.

Kolanovic also served as co-head of JPMorgan's (JPM) global research. The memo said Hussein Malik will now become the sole head.

JPMorgan (JPM) did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha, and neither did Kolanovic nor Malik.

Kolanovic was consistently bullish on U.S. equities for much of 2022, a year in which the benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) slumped nearly 20%.

The analyst turned bearish towards the end of the market bottoming out, and has remained firmly so even as the S&P (SP500) rebounded almost 25% in 2023 and advanced more than 14% in H1 2024.

As recently as Friday, Kolanovic backed his ultra-bearish year-end target of 4,200 points for the S&P 500 (SP500), even as the index has powered past 5,500 and has caused other brokerages to drive up their estimates.",112,0.93

*Increased demand is a factor in the air freight market. In a recent note to clients, Xeneta wrote that the global air cargo market is ""on a pathway to double-digit growth in volumes in 2024, after a +12% year-on-year jump in demand in May.*

Inflationary pressure continues. Insurance rates will continue to climb. As shipping costs continue to go up...

Prices will be keep getting passed to cash strapped consumers or companies will lose money as money as their pricing powers are gone, and have to eat the extra costs.

Then there is another Porsche stock, $PAH3, which is a holding company that owns the majority of Volkswagen stock.

Porsche Holding is extremely undervalued with a P/E ratio of 2.53, which is even lower than the P/E ratio of Volkswagen and much lower than the P/E of $P911.

Can someone explain to me why Porsche Holding is so cheap? When buying this stock, it essentially means buying the Porsche manufacturing company at a 30-40% discount, plus you also get the other stocks that Volkswagen owns.

TL;DR: $PAH3 is extremely cheap, or I’m highly regarded (maybe both).

The question is do you believe in their vision. 

I personally think tesla is investing for a future economy where they are primary disruptors. And I wouldn't be surprised if they are the most valuable company in the world by 2030. 

This is because as many of you may not fully appreciate, tesla has a moat. They own the full ecosystem of technology. They have the charging infrastructure, the manufacturing capacity to build robotaxis/humanoid robots, energy storage,  software development, the data, and even lithium production. The fact that tesla owns the full stack of technology gives them a competitive advantage. The robotaxi and humanoid robot industries are going to be the key pillars of the 21st century industrial revolution ushering in a productivity and profit boom.

1) corner post

2) chevron 

There’s plenty of room for nuance and I’ve got to look into it much, much more, but, here’s my general take aways

1) swipe fee companies can create as many bullshit companies as they want to challenge regulations in perpetuity 

2) swipe fee companies can jack rates indiscriminately with no regard for regulations outside the letter of the law.

While the chevron ruling includes a caveat that it’s not retroactively “undoing” everything established, they make it clear that those precedents are not set in stone either. They literally are not law. Therefore, between the two cases, swipe fee companies should be able to generate companies to challenge regulations at will, forever, and the regulations they challenge, outside that which is outlined in the underlying law, essentially have no authority. Obviously, the SC is gonna do what it wants regardless of hypocrisy and/or technicality, but if there isn’t a hard on for swipe fee companies I think in time this could mean the cuffs just got reallll loose

Main point of the article:

_Per Morgan Stanley’s note, major hyperscalers in China, while complying with export control regulations, are purchasing NVIDIA’s H20 chips for AI computing needs. Although smaller AI data center vendors in China can offer the H100 GPU for rental, the larger hyperscalers are opting to buy the H20, adhering to the regulatory requirements.
Based on their field trip takeaways, analysts said the single-chip performance of the H20 is only 15% that of the H100. Furthermore, when comparing ""Performance Density"" based on the Float 16 data type, the H20's single chip performance is only 3% of that of the H100.
“However, by connecting a cluster of H20 GPUs, performance can reach 50% of that of the H100, thanks to higher networking bandwidth and the HBM density of H20,” analysts pointed out. “And hence it is possible the H20 chip price could also be 50% of H100.”_

Jensen keeps telling y’all the world isn’t waiting on shit — the AI race is on now, and there’s no stopping it in the near future. Does that guarantee NVDA will dominate like this for the next decade? I don’t fucking know, I work at Wendy’s.

But when even your biggest political foe cannot keep its hands off nvda chips, may be some of you chubby berrs should give it a rest too.

* I've spent a lot of time with data science and AI, but I rarely see Palantir products in the wild. Snowflake's products, for comparison, are pretty ubiquitous for data engineering.
* The AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform) looks great on paper, but it'll take a lot of resources to implement it. Just picture trying to integrate all the production and logistics details of even a small-sized company—it’s a huge task that requires a lot of Palantir experts and thus money.
* This brings me to the next thing: Palantir was often called a ""glorified"" IT consulting company, not a real software company. From what I know, Palantir doesn't have its own foundational AI model. AIP is ""just"" a platform for implementing models like GPT-4 and mirroring a company's internal networks. Such customized software solutions must be a huge effort to create and maintain. But what's the moat here? That doesn't mean that the resulting software is bad, but how does this scale? To me, this sounds like a consulting business...
* Palantir has a great reputation thanks to its government contracts. But this mainly comes from the days when it was hard for government organizations to find good programmers - perfect conditions for an IT consulting company. 
* Palantir's bulls often say that the company's most advanced technology is top secret, which makes it hard to see how they're ahead of the game. If these cutting-edge technologies are only for the military and intelligence, then Palantir is basically a defense contractor, which also doesn’t justify the current valuation.

I'm looking forward to a productive discussion :-)",399,0.89

Let this be a lesson to every regard that strikes it rich. Never Fomo in again and get angry when making investment decisions, because you will get your bootywhole pummeled without lube and it will be brutal

I think what makes this post 10x more brutal is that I'm 28 so this is basically my life savings lol

I was planning on taking a chick out to vacay and buying a property but I guess I'll do that in the next 3 years or so lol

THE STORY

The reason why I didn't buy calls again after the stellar earnings report is because after having traded Nvidia for several months, I knew what kind of monster I was dealing with. High sensitivity to federal reserve rate announcements, the war in Gaza, tech shows etc. even when I put a stop loss I'd wake up and see it sell and blow past the stop loss I put it at so if I sell early I lose if I don't sell I lose it was all fucked lol

So I was like ok let's avoid the stress of waking up and seeing me getting fucked because of a bad position or for it to drop back down to the low thousands I'll just stay out for a bit

Little did I know, this fucking company would go up 40% over the span of 2 months with only a 20% increase in guidance. How does that even remotely make sense

But it's clear that stock markets have long abandoned rational movement patterns. It should have stopped around 1150 or 1200 and corrected down to 1100 or something but nah that Bch kept going up

And it just pissed me off so much, I could've full ported again and had half a million in the bank and never had to deal with this shit again, but I opted out and opted back in at the worst possible time and in the worst way possible lmao

Knowing my luck this shits gonna trade sideways for the rest of July and then start the ascent on August so I'll buy august calls when they're a little cheaper and do another full port on this earnings. After that I'll probably ride the gains for a week and never touch this shit again lol

Either that or lose every penny 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Especially as LLY becomes the first trillion dollar healthcare company owing to their GLP1 and other longevity breakthroughs (and kicks off market wide fomo). 

They’ll “average” into puts and wake up to new ATHs. It’ll drive them insane. If you don’t believe me, ask the guy here who’s been shorting LLY since 400$ and seetheposting begging people to buy puts every other week. 

I think what bers get wrong is that healthcare isn’t like electronics or utilities or other goods (where you anticipate spending/costs/margins/earnings growth hitting a wall from all the advancements). 

On the contrary, as we inch towards a world that’s more and more automated (despite what all the doomers calling for the end of the world want to believe), healthcare is the only sector that will justify and see more spending imo. 

If spared from the usual mundane burdens of life (owing to increased efficiency across the economy), Wouldn’t you spend more of your income and time on healthcare? Whether surface level stuff like fixing baldness (to signal status in a world where those games are inescapable) or serious stuff like addiction or obesity which leads to overall well being? 

I personally (even if a bit naive) am hopeful for an optimistic future where all of us spend a larger % of our income —on everything from glp1, reversible gene therapy, early prevention solutions unique to your DNA profile— in an attempt to extend our lifetime, if only because everything else in life has become much more cheaper/accessible.

The stock market regularly fucks up on consumer trends that are staring them in the face because fund managers are old ass white dudes who could care less about what Zoomers are wearing. This market inefficiency is easily exploited if you just walk around college campuses and big cities and pay attention. This is why I've made racks off Abercrombie & Fitch and Crocs while Wall Street and you basement dwellers could only scratch your heads as to why Tik Tok Americans are buying this crap.

I come to you with this next fashion trade: a quintessential American brand focused on old WASPy aesthetics and aspirational wealth made available to the average consumer. For a long time, RL was languishing as the only people buying their gaudy sportwear were software engineers and sysadmins who wear too much cologne. Finally, this brand has leaned into its classic and refined designs and is appealing to a new base of consumers who are conscious of fashion brands ripping them off with poor quality design and materials. Zoomers grow tired of their Shein hauls lasting 4-5 wears before falling apart and are now seeking quality. For this they turn to RL. [The Polo Bear](https://www.tiktok.com/@the_real_lin_shady/video/7337744810003975466?q=polo%20bear&t=1719855313784) and [American Flag](https://www.tiktok.com/@lindigoff/video/7247314494374890794?q=ralph%20lauren%20flag&t=1719855347065) sweaters have taken off in recent quarters, and their newly launched [Olympics merch](https://www.ralphlauren.com/women-clothing-sweaters/team-usa-graphic-cotton-sweater/0077505337.html?utm_source=CSE&utm_medium=GooglePLA__21396036850_&utm_source=CSE&utm_medium=GooglePLA__21396036850_&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwp4m0BhBAEiwAsdc4aPScu0NhB1xCuOjCCJRfBT1kh_GxKqOrM3gELc3rwJ1dELvEbSYo9hoCZqMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) will continue propelling the brand forward. Many have been wrong about this stock in the past, [including this guy who yolo'd earnings puts that expired OTM](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/), and I'm going to clear the confusion about this stock's recent momentum and place within larger fashion trends in America and worldwide.

# Why 🌈🐻 Are Wrong

Following Nike's disastrous earnings RL has continued a downward trend from ATH finding support at \~$170. Many assume that RL trades in the same group as companies like NKE and LULU, these are all luxury fashion brands of course, but RL is positioned differently. Athleisure is dead. If you walk around big cities like New York, regardless of time of day, fewer women are wearing the full LULU yoga set. The market for athleisure is saturated and being disrupted by cheap brands like Alo and Shein. Another trend fund managers fail to understand is Return to Office Fashion. You have an entire generation of young women who have never had a real job - and if they did it was a remote internship during the scamdemic - now asking on Tik Tok: ""How do I dress for the office""? [Ralph is a favorite brand](https://www.tiktok.com/@sx.ash/video/7324422099257347360?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7340732515428959790) for these [office girlies](https://www.tiktok.com/@mrsinkeduk/video/7314567769750523168?q=Ralph%20Lauren%20office&t=1719855177692) still figuring out what they're to be wearing. NKE and LULU make fund managers think that the American consumer is faltering, but this is not the case. They are simply terrible at managing trends. Look at Nike's product offerings. The [Adidas Samba](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidas.com%2Fus%2Fsamba-og-shoes%2FB75806.html&psig=AOvVaw0q5eapOvTD7lqAqoakYuB-&ust=1719941639846000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBEQjRxqFwoTCOD42YSwhocDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) is the hottest sneaker right now for young men and women, coming off of the dominance of New Balance's suede casual sneakers. Nike makes only 1 or 2 sneakers ([Killshot](https://www.nike.com/t/killshot-2-womens-shoes-3z3Nnb/FZ5630-100) and Cortez) that have this classic casual, white leather look that consumers are looking for. Instead they focus only on athleisure and workout segments rather than fashion.

# Consumer Trends

In fashion, all of these mid level mall brands are trying to reposition themselves as ""luxury"" for the simple reason that they can charge more for each garment. However, many are doing this wrong. They are selling the same plastic crap for higher prices with more marketing. This has not been working great for Zara, Uniqlo, H&M, and others. This has worked out very well for Abercrombie & Fitch, Wall Street's current fashion darling, A&F has pivoted to selling clothes that are on trend with minimal branding and a commitment to quality. [A $50 shirt from A&F](https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us/p/long-sleeve-rugby-polo-53491348?seq=01&source=googleshopping&cmp=PLA:EVG:20:A:D:US:X:GGL:X:SHOP:X:X:X:X:x:A%26F+Adults_Google_Shopping_PLA_US_Tops_All+products_PRODUCT_GROUP&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwp4m0BhBAEiwAsdc4aKoAbCRC5Ox_imUloA2HQ9JoIj4d8l92rJcS5INAYK3sD6vmshmrZxoCpo0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) uses high quality cotton that you can feel will last while Uniqlo keeps trying to market its $50 polyester shirts as ""office tech wear"" or some crap. RL is uniquely positioned with its brand placement historically to offer high quality items for high prices, and the consumer knows these garments will last for years. In addition, these looks are ""classic Americana"" and won't go out of style as quickly as these [Shein microtrends](https://www.tiktok.com/@catyaps/video/7353318659533622570?q=microtrends&t=1719855637194). The consumer has more confidence buying an RL garment that they are getting their money's worth for a quality garment.

I mentioned that walking around New York City you do not see athleisure, but you do see RL's biggest sellers everywhere. Gay guys love the Polo Bear: wearing it on sweaters and tshirts. Women love the American Flag sweater as an ""Old Money Fashion"" statement piece. I frequently see dupes from[ Shein or other Chinese crap](https://us.shein.com/American-Flag-Pattern-Drop-Shoulder-Sweater-p-21875906-cat-1734.html) companies of the American Flag sweater. This is probably bearish, but imitation is the highest form of flattery I guess? The trend is growing and has staying power if other companies want to swoop in.

Off the backs of these trendy items, RL has recently launched its Olympics Team USA collection which incorporates many designs from the brand's classic Americana past. This is already generating [social media buzz](https://x.com/fetacheesepls/status/1807467583035089004), and as we approach the Olympics this will create brand momentum. The opening ceremony and the team's clothing will likely generate additional buzz. We are 25 days out from the Olympics, this should be a great window to build a short term trade with the stock currently at support.

# Fundamentals

For a quick look at fundamentals, let's do a Peer comparison:

|Ticker|PE|TEV/EBIDTA|Debt/EBITDA|Gross Margin PCT|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|LULU|24.0|11.9|0.5|58.3%|
|NKE|20.2|14.0|1.5|44.6%|
|LEVI|53.6|8.2|2.0|58.0%|
|ANF|22.2|8.1|0.9|64.1%|
|**RL**|**18.0**|**7.2**|**1.6**|**66.8%**|

As we can see, RL is a leader among its peers in margin while trading at a discount relative to some of the biggest players in the space. RL carries some higher debt levels, but for a brand with this kind of momentum it is good to see them investing in current trends. This will pay off long term. If RL were trading at the median PE of its peer group the stock would see a 27% gain. If it were trading at median Price/Revenue we would see a 22% gain. My long term price target for RL is thus a 25% gain putting us at about $212/share.

A quick look at the balance sheet. EPS is up 28% YoY with Revenue mostly flat at 2.9% increase YoY. Interestingly, the street estimates that 2025 Revenue will only increase 2.35%. I believe analysts are missing the trend and growing momentum behind RL. Increased sales volume will lead a surge in revenue growth, and assuming margin improvements persist you will see a much greater increase in EPS.

# Technicals

https://preview.redd.it/u2olfdnx3y9d1.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f3ed3329f935ac14abfa193a34433eae15d15fb

For a quick look at technicals, RL's monster earnings in February broke them out of a long term channel and price has been volatile since. The earnings pump sold off only to pump on their earnings again in late May. The stock is finding support at a long term Fibonacci level around $170. Momentum looks shit right now, it is on the lower end of the bollinger bands and looking oversold on the stochastic. I'm looking to buy around the $170 Fibonacci and psychological support and will continue to buy down to $160.

Moreover, if there was a notable increase in the first half, like the 14.48% this year, growth in the second half is almost inevitable.

If we plot the second half's performance on the trend line—that is, the line that minimizes the distance from all points on the chart—we can expect an additional +10%, with a very narrow range of possible values.

The low dispersion intrigued me the most. It almost rules out the possibility of ending the year below 5600, and more likely points to a level closer to 6000

So we have 160k using GLP’s via HIMS at 1.99 a month. 

1.99 X 12 X 160000 = 380MM 

This does not factor in new subscribers coming into HIMS and signing up for GLP’s
( who knows what that number might be ) 

This also does not factor in new subscribers choosing other products like dick pills or hair loss and seeing HIMS as a one stop shop for bone dogs, losing some weight and getting some hair - 

Currently HIMS forecasted to do about 1.2BB for 2024 and be in the black a couple hundred million

There are over 100MM people who are obese in the USA ( that’s probably on the light side ) 

So we are basically asking for less than .2% of 1% of obese people in the USA to sign up for a product that is 80% cheaper than WEGOVY  ? 

I believe we are going to see some seriously explosive numbers that take this stock parabolic.  This name is mispriced for maybe the CEO and his comments , that short report, people saying there is no Moat and all that. 

But when you blow your numbers out and show that type of bottom line growth that all gets thrown out

Last week was full of news of Hedge funds and institutional buyers triming their portfolio fearing the stock has risen too rapidly.

Even the annual share holder meeting on 26th June failed to restore the moment and the stock continued to languish at sub 130$ levels.

Some have put blame on Q3 [supposedly a quarter for poor returns for tech stock] while others have pointed out to investor fatigue with the stock.

Technical traders have pointed to a gap at 95-99$ that is yet to be filled. 

What to do?

With price targets averaged at $53.86 with a “Strong Buy” rating, currently, DKNG is UNDERVALUED BY 44%. On top of this, the RSI is sitting at 41, almost OVERSOLD, and the MacD is at -0.15. This typically shows downward momentum, but these also often indicate a strong reversal in stock direction is approaching. 

Draftkings also has great financials, reporting a 57% YOY revenue increase, according to the quarter ending March 31, with projected 31-36% YOY  growth in revenue for fiscal year 2024. 

Despite this, the short interest in DraftKings (DKNG) has risen by 26.69% since its last report, with 21.32 million shares sold short, which is 4.51% of all regular shares available for trading. And I know short interest is a shot in the dark, but it definitely means something in situations like this where a strong stock is already 50% undervalued and hasn’t even hit it’s most popular season yet.

432,1dshht2,2024-07-01 01:53:30,Nvidia Just Getting Started: Stock Heading to $150 and Possibly $200 by year’s end,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. 

AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical.

Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.

Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger.

That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution.

Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

However, management optimism still hasn’t translated to company profits.

Despite mentioning “AI” 40 times in its Q1 2024 earnings call, Adobe’s management predicted decelerating earnings and revenue growth of 12% and 10%, respectively, and its stock fell by 13.7% that day.

Similarly, Salesforce and Dell, which had both tripled between December 2022 and May 2024 on AI optimism, fell 18% and 15%, respectively, after their May earnings calls, with Morgan Stanley analysts noting that GenAI bookings still hadn’t improved Salesforce’s top line, while Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi asked if Dell was selling its AI servers at zero margin, noting that its $1.7 billion in server revenue didn’t boost operating profits.

While many companies are surely to profit from AI boom such as NVIDIA from chip sales and Microsoft from cloud compute, will Apple be one of them?

Much of Apples stock boom has been around its AI hype. However, it’s still yet to see how this translates into more iPhone sales or higher profitability for the company? Are they planning to offer AI as an add-on like Samsung? There’s also the question of public’s perception of privacy concerns.

448,1ds7hjz,2024-06-30 18:04:45,what are your projections for TSLA 8/24/24?,"The concept of robotaxis, particularly spearheaded by a company like Tesla, holds promising prospects:

Accessibility: Robotaxis could provide a reliable transportation option for those who cannot afford a personal vehicle. This can significantly enhance mobility for people in lower-income brackets, the elderly, and those with disabilities.

Cost Efficiency: Autonomous vehicles can operate around the clock without the need for a human driver, reducing operational costs. This could result in more affordable ride-hailing services, making transportation more economical for everyone.

Traffic and Emissions Reduction: Autonomous vehicles can optimize routes and improve traffic flow, potentially reducing congestion. With a fleet of electric robotaxis, the overall emissions could decrease, contributing to cleaner air in urban areas.

Safety Improvements: AI-driven vehicles have the potential to reduce accidents caused by error. Enhanced safety features and constant monitoring can make roads safer for all users.

Urban Planning and Infrastructure: Widespread adoption of robotaxis could influence urban planning. Cities might repurpose parking spaces for green areas, pedestrian zones, or other community uses, as the need for personal vehicle ownership decreases.

Economic Impact: The development and deployment of robotaxis can create new job opportunities in tech, maintenance, and infrastructure development, while also potentially displacing traditional driving jobs. This shift will require new training and adaptation in the workforce.

Environmental Benefits: As Tesla's fleet is electric, robotaxis will likely reduce the dependency on fossil fuels, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change.

Socioeconomic Impact: By providing affordable and efficient transportation, robotaxis can help bridge the mobility gap, enabling people from various socioeconomic backgrounds to access better job opportunities, education, and healthcare.

Tesla's leadership in AI and autonomous driving technology positions it well to drive this change. The company's existing infrastructure, extensive research, and development in AI and energy storage solutions provide a strong foundation for the successful implementation of robotaxis. If Tesla's robotaxi service can overcome regulatory and technical challenges, it has the potential to transform the transportation landscape significantly",0,0.47
449,1ds6706,2024-06-30 17:05:42,ASTS,"AST D2D 5G technology is ready to enhance the telecommunications industry. This will commence at the end of Sept when they launch 5 sats - BB1s. 5 sats which will provide 125 milly revs next year and already have AST EBIDTA break even purportedly. The plan is to produce 4 sats per month next year and beyond. Approx 100 sats are needed to be fully operational. 

AST has superior tech to any pretenders trying to get into the space and they will have no competitor for years. Their tech is patented and took them many years to establish. Starlink tend to be who people fear the most re competition. There is a misconception that Starlink are ahead of the game with anything to do with space based communication services. Starlink are largely in a diff lane - broadband and have yet to show that they will be a real competitor at all in the D2D 5G space. Even in their main area of focus, broadband, their tech is expensive and clunky - requiring a receiver for functionality. They’ve literally just announced in the last year or two that they’re going to get involved in the D2D space. How many years behind AST are they? Maybe 5? Maybe more?…

AST have MOU’s with over 50 MNO’s including Vodafone and Rakuten. They have recently signed commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon, as well as received strategic funding from both companies. This is what led to a recent share price surge as the sole remaining short thesis - funding risks/dilution - was invalidated. Furthermore, AST are set to dominate the US market with AT&T and Verizon on board. Imo it seems likely T-Mobile, who have a relationship with Starlink, will have to follow suit because Starlink have no service to offer them and won’t for many years, if ever. The scant short thesis has now evaporated and they have started to cover - as seen by a 30% or so reduction in short interest over the last month. AST have said there will be no more dilution this year. It seems there will be no more public offerings full stop going forward as AST have 50 MNO’s yet to formalise commercial agreements with - many of whom will provide strategic investment/funding via revenue prepayment and convertible loans. 

AT&T recently said that they surveyed their subscribers and 30-40% said they would sign up to AST’s service when available. AST have access to 2.8 billion users through existing agreements with MNO’s. If we assume even a pessimistic take up of 20% (not the 30-40% AT&T mentioned) then that would be 560 million yearly users of ASTS. This is not including users who are currently in dead zones of many parts of Asia, Africa, South America who currently have no phones (as there are no telecom poles/companies providing signal - a problem which AST will solve). It also doesn’t include governmental/DoD contracts or the use of day passes. 

So to give you an idea of revenue potential: 

We don’t know how much AST will charge users for the service. We do know it will be cheap and accessible. The cheapest possible it will be is $2 ($1 to Ast and 1$ to MNO). I believe it will be double that. However I want to show you revenue potential with the most pessimistic of uptake/price.

So pessimistically we will have 560 mill users (remember this doesn’t include dead zone users, governmental contracts, day passes and it is a pessimistic 20% uptake). AST will pessimistically be getting $1 dollar per month form each user or $12 yearly (I believe it will be at least 1.5 times more than that, maybe twice as much). So 560X12 = revenue of 6.7 billion with net profit of around 5 billion due to high margins. With a conservative 25 PE that with mean a market cap of 125 billion. Again, even allowing for a pessimistic 10% more dilution this would equate to a share price of 420 when fully operational. They should be fully operational by 2028. So doing the maths as pessimistically as possible I get a 420 share price. While this share price may sound crazy, considering ASTS is currently 11.50 per share or so, it’s really not. Transhumanica have a 500 PT by 2030 and Deutsche Bank have a PT of 676 by 2027. Have you ever seen a firm slap a 60x PT on a stock?

Netflix wants investors to keep thinking about growth but will stop reporting subscriber numbers soon. (Because it is going flat) Anyone who wants Netflix here has it already.

It is very clear that the reputational damage that has been done to Boeing will take a long time to repair. So what about the competition such as Air Bus? From my limited knowledge of the aviation world they are the primary competitor, would they not likely receive a progressive uptick in their sales for the foreseeable future?

A small-time rookie here. I'm looking for a long-term investment opportunity (3-4 years at least) that promises solid gains. While I aim to maintain a diverse portfolio, I'm considering allocating a substantial portion of my capital to a single company.

One company on my radar is Boeing. Despite the safety issues and incidents they've faced, I find it puzzling that their stock value remains significantly lower than its pre-pandemic levels, especially given the current surge in travel and vacationing among Americans. The demand for air travel is hitting record numbers.

With the public scrutiny over safety issues and the recent leadership shakeup, I'm hopeful that these problems will be resolved and Boeing's stock will return to pre-pandemic levels, offering a substantial gain.

**Abstract:** This paper explores the pervasive presence of fractal and chaotic patterns in everyday objects and natural phenomena, drawing parallels with their manifestation in financial market dynamics. By elucidating how patterns observed in crumpled fabric, tree branches, and mountain ranges mirror those seen in stock market charts, this study unveils underlying principles that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. Understanding these connections not only enriches our theoretical frameworks of complexity and order but also holds profound implications for predictive modeling and strategic decision-making in financial markets.

**Introduction:** Patterns are fundamental to both natural systems and human-made constructs, influencing perception and predictive analytics across disciplines. In financial markets, identifying and interpreting patterns such as trend reversals, breakouts, and support-resistance levels is crucial for informed decision-making. Conversely, observations of fractal geometry and chaotic dynamics in everyday phenomena suggest a deeper coherence and underlying order that may inform novel insights in investment strategies.

**Literature Review:** Synthesizing seminal works from mathematics, physics, ecology, and finance, this review establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding fractal and chaotic patterns across diverse domains. Key concepts include self-similarity across scales, sensitivity to initial conditions, and the role of pattern recognition in human cognition and decision-making processes. By contextualizing these concepts within the realms of financial markets and natural phenomena, this review sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration into their interconnectedness and practical implications.

**Methodology:** This study employs a multidisciplinary approach, integrating advanced computational algorithms with qualitative analysis to identify and quantify fractal patterns in both financial data and visual representations of natural structures. Case studies include detailed analyses of crumpled fabrics, tree line formations, and mountainous topographies, where fractal dimensions and recurrence plots highlight structural similarities with market trends. Statistical validation ensures robustness in pattern identification, facilitating actionable insights and predictive modeling applications.

**Results and Discussion:** The findings underscore striking parallels between financial market dynamics and natural phenomena, revealing how fractal and chaotic patterns manifest universally. The crumpled fabric exhibits patterns resembling trend lines with breakouts and retracements, akin to market behaviors observed in asset prices. Analogously, natural structures such as tree branches and coastlines demonstrate fractal properties mirroring market volatility and trend formations. This holistic understanding not only enriches theoretical frameworks but also positions these insights as pivotal in informing strategic decision-making and risk management strategies in financial markets.

**Conclusion:** In conclusion, this paper posits fractal and chaotic patterns as foundational elements underlying complexity and order in both natural and financial systems. By elucidating their presence in everyday phenomena, from fabric folds to geological formations, we advance our understanding of predictive analytics and strategic foresight in investment management. Embracing this interdisciplinary perspective not only fosters innovation in financial analysis but also underscores the intrinsic unity and interconnectedness of diverse systems. As we navigate the complexities of global markets, harnessing the insights derived from fractal geometry and chaotic dynamics holds transformative potential in navigating uncertainty and unlocking hidden opportunities.",0,0.48

However, the current share price of ACI is roughly $19.75 and the merger sale price is 27.25. Assuming the merger goes through that's a 37.97% gain if the merger goes through. However, I see even more potential if the merger fails. A potential of 81.77% gain in a base case. The down side I see is the fact that the stock is probably going to slowly go down over the next few months until the merger decision goes through. There may be a slight uptick coming up on august as the merger trial begins.

Merger goes through: I think this is the less likely case and most people are assuming an incredibly 90%+ chance of the FTC denying this merger but, I think there is some fair reasoning why it might. 1) Walmart is huge. It holds so much market share the merger will still hold less than half of Walmart's market share and the merged company will be just slightly larger than Costco's market share. 2) The companies largely operate in different areas of the U.S. and have been working toward divesting certain stores where the competition would be stopped. 

Merger gets Denied: Probably more likely but, possibly the better outcome for investors. I've done a dcf and get a bear case of roughly $24, a base case of roughly $36, and a bull case of $60. I think since the merger began the company has been letting a lot of extra weight off and making the company more profitable. The companies share price is held down from the merger and the large amount of debt they took on to make the large dividend payment a year ago. The company however has shown it can handle the debt really well and are moving in a great direction.

**Metalworking Facing Higher Costs**

The PPI in Metalworking peaked to all time high percent change from year ago at 10% in September 2022. The YoY change has come down since then with the percent change at 4.9% for May 2024. This has decreased MSM’s gross profit dollar and margin from $411M to $388M and 43% to 42% from May 2022 to March 2024 respectively. MSM stock is down 26% from all time high back in October 2023. This high PPI is priced in the stock; the percent change from a year ago gradual decline can serve as a positive welcome for MSM moving forward as gross profit margins have started trending back upwards.

**Technical Analysis**

An inverse cup and handle pattern occurred during 2021 prior to October 20^(th), 2021. The earnings results were underwhelming, and the stock dropped near 5%. One can argue that there was also a head and shoulder pattern to suggest downside.

Now let’s compare to today. An inverse cup is present but without the handle and there is no clear head and shoulder pattern compared to October 2021. With the stock already down 26% the known headwinds for the company is already priced in – a slight positive nudge on the call may be enough for the stock to increase this earnings on Tuesday before market open. The stock currently sits at $78.01 which is a key price support and resistance line.

The GF Value is currently suggesting MSM is Modestly Undervalued… this is just to make me feel good.

Historical Performance of QQQ in July: Historically, July has been a strong month for the QQQ. Given this historical trend, I expect the bullish momentum in QQQ to influence Tesla’s price movement.

Capital Rotation from NVIDIA to Other Stocks: The recent surge in NVIDIA’s stock has captured significant investor interest. As the stock market operates in cycles, I anticipate a capital rotation where investors move profits from one high-performing stock to others. With NVIDIA’s impressive rally, it’s likely that investors will take profits and seek opportunities in other promising tech stocks like Tesla. This influx of capital can drive Tesla’s stock price higher. 

Combined FOMO from Robotaxi Event, Optimus, and Earnings: Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi event, the developments around Tesla Optimus, and its earnings report are all highly anticipated. The FOMO on potentially groundbreaking announcements related to Tesla’s advancements in autonomous driving technology and the Tesla Optimus robot, combined with the anticipation of positive earnings results, can create substantial buying pressure.

PayPal has experienced a significant decline in its stock price in recent weeks. In this due diligence, I aim to outline my market expectations for the next two to three weeks incorporating current data.

Market Expectation and Fundamental Reasons:
A key reason for PayPal's sell-off could be increasing competition, including from Apple Pay. This may lead to intensified competition and potential market share loss for PayPal. However, PayPal and Apple Pay may cater to different target audiences. Many individuals regularly use PayPal alongside their traditional bank accounts. I certainly do. Invest in companies whose products you use.

Current Valuation:
As of June 28, 2024, PayPal's stock price was $58.03 USD. The Price-Earnings Ratio (P/E) stands at 14.58, based on Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $3.98 USD. The Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S) is 1.99 and the Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B) is 2.93. Historically, PayPal appears significantly undervalued, given the average P/E ratio of the last nine years was 44.65.

Market Sentiment and Technical Analysis:
The overall market has shown positive performance in 2024, driven particularly by the 'Mag Seven' companies. However, market breadth remains constrained, indicating many stocks are still undervalued. A sector rotation in the second half of 2024 could benefit fintechs like PayPal, especially if interest rate expectations decline and AI technology is leveraged for efficiency gains.

Technical Indicators and Sentiment:
PayPal's Dealer Gamma Exposure (GEX) recently stood at -30, coupled with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicating an oversold market sentiment. Bullish divergence within the overarching bearish scenario suggests a possible bottom formation. Support zones in the technical picture reinforce this assumption. Historically, July has been an attractive month for PayPal with high returns. A near-panic sell-off could reverse sharply due to Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). A rapid upward movement.

The negative GEX could, in a highly unlikely scenario, catalyze a small Gamma Squeeze.

Volatility and Short Interest:
Volatility, as measured by the VIX, has decreased, interpreted as a bullish signal because it could possibly drop further. PYPL's volatility has also significantly decreased. Short interest for PayPal stands at approximately 2% of outstanding shares, relatively low, indicating moderate investor confidence. Open interest of put-call options also shows a relatively balanced positioning.

In summary, the analysis suggests PayPal has promising prospects despite short-term challenges. Fundamental and technical indicators support the belief that PayPal could see positive developments, particularly in July and throughout the year.

I anticipate broader market increases and sector rotations. Undervalued stocks are likely to gain momentum. Therefore, I am LONG on PYPL.",14,0.6
484,1drecmg,2024-06-29 15:57:28,Why I’m short TSLA and you should be too,"First their delivery numbers for Q3 will be lower than expectations, signaling continuing falling demand. This is after the price cuts, low interest rate offerings, and discounts. Demand just isn’t there and they do not have enough time to turn things around.


Margins keep getting tighter and tighter, falling to levels similar to other automotive companies. “But but FSD and robotaxi”. FSD hasn’t had the perceived success they thought it would have - people just like driving their cars and the extra value isn’t there for the normal person. Robotaxi won’t be ready this year, I’d be surprised if it’s ready next year - this is the most obvious sell the news out there, especially based on Tesla’s track record of over-promising and hyping things up. 


They currently have nothing in their financials but “hope” that signals a turnaround. Fundamentals clearly show TSLA is overpriced and I expect a tank in the near term. Oh and once the Delaware judge validates the attorney fees Tesla will have to pay those attorneys in billions worth of options which will almost assuredly be sold. Good luck to TSLA bulls but things aren’t looking good.

The TLDR version is up till now courts would turn to federal regulators that could ""interpret"" ambiguous language however they wanted, essentially ""making up laws"". This is why, for example, the SEC can regulate crypto despite there being no clear-cut legislation. After this ruling, federal judges now have all the power, the regulators are cucked.

This feels like uncharted territory. Definitely going to have long lasting and far reaching implications for markets. Our entire legal system just changed overnight.

Smells bullish to me. Less regulation means more innovation. It also means your breakfast cereal will probably give you cancer. Exciting times ahead.

At the end most analysts seemed to have resigned to the idea, that it is a meme stock, disconnected from financial fundamentals or any real value, riding solely on emotions and support for Donald Trump. At best it was supposed to be a measurement of his followers fervor.

On Thursday, in the deep, deep shadows of everything else, that has happened during the debate and and the discussion about it, that idea died a quiet and lonely death.

If the assessment of DJT being a meme stock and riding the waves of confidence in Donald Trump held up, DJT should have gone through the roof. Instead, while there were small spikes, representing how much positive sentiment was present in the share price, the stock started sliding over Friday, once more sheddding a lot of it´s superfluous value over the course of a single day.

As far as the idea of meme stocks go, this is a red flag, big enough to cover a May Parade in Moscow, while Paul Revere is galloping off and the beacons of Gondor are lit.

I want the Y axis to show the absolute number for each of the studies. But whenever I overlay them, the Y axis switches to a percentage, and its not a very helpful way to see the data because its not obvious when IV is higher than HV. For example, I screenshotted the SPY IV and HV overlay. At the place where its circled the IV is 3 times higher than the HV. But becayse the Y axis is the percentage, these lines are overlapping rather than the HV line being way higher than the IV line. Can anyone help with configuring this Y axis issue when you overlay 2 studies? Thanks

Bank of America's  will offer Structured Financial products on Wells Fargo stock, with a 10% annual yield.

Bank of America will check Well's Fargo's closing price on July 05 2024 to determine the reference price.

|| || |October 7, 2024|| |January 6, 2025|| |April 7, 2025|| |July 7, 2025|| |October 6, 2025|| |January 5, 2026|| |April 6, 2026|| |July 6, 2026|| |October 5, 2026|| |January 5, 2027|| |April 5, 2027|

If the closing price of Wells Fargo stock is below 44-46 per share on any of the above dates, the bond will be liquidated for a 100% loss. All coupon payments made prior to the liquidation will not be affected. If the price finishes above the July 05 2024 closing price on any of the above dates, the bond will be redeemed early and no further coupon payments will be made.

All of the above days are a Monday :)

Knowing that these rich people will try to earn the maximum return on these bonds,  They will likely attempt to keep the price below 60 on Wells Fargo stock on the dates above, and just above 44-46 to avoid liquidation.

Options in Play:

1. Long Call: Buy the 18th Dec 2026 $540 Call
2. Short Call: Sell the 18th Dec 2026 $545 Call

# Why This Should Work

SPY's Historical Performance: SPY has a strong track record of growth. By 2026, there's a high probability that SPY will be well above our target price, especially given its historical resilience and growth patterns.

Break-Even Point**:** We set the break-even point just $1 above the current price. This is a conservative estimate, giving us a wide margin for profit.

# The Strategy: Call Debit Spread

By using a call debit spread, we can minimize our initial outlay while maximizing potential profits. Here's how:

1. Buy the $540 Call (Long Call)**:** This gives us the right to buy SPY at $540 by Dec 2026.
2. Sell the $545 Call (Short Call)**:** This obligates us to sell SPY at $545, capping our maximum profit but also reducing our initial cost.

# Final Thoughts

This strategy hinges on SPY's continued upward trajectory, which is a reasonable assumption given its historical performance. By setting our break-even point conservatively and leveraging a call debit spread, we can potentially unlock significant profits with a controlled risk. I also understand for this strategy to be effective; you would need to invest a considerably large capital to make some serious profit.

529,1dqub5d,2024-06-28 21:07:44,BYND is about to go BYND the moon.,"Remember when this stock ran up like 90 percent last earnings??? It wasn't because of the earnings... it was this.

Beyond Meat (BYND) is getting ATTACKED by shorts with a MASSIVE 39%+ short interest on its float. But guess what? On June 27th, BYND made its epic entrance onto the REGSHO INCLUSION LIST 🚀💥 and you know what that means... MOON TIME!

**What's regsho?** Glad you asked! According to Rule 203(c)(6) of Regulation SHO, a ""threshold security"" means:
- Fails to deliver 10,000+ shares for 5 straight days
- Fails equal to at least 0.5% of total shares outstanding
- Security is listed by a self-regulatory organization (SRO)

Basically, it's a list of heavily shorted stocks that need to cover their butts! 😜 When BYND is on regsho, shorting is like trying to wrestle a bear in a phone booth. Liquidity is tight and borrowing costs are THROUGH THE ROOF (IBKR’s retail fee is a whopping 111.7216%! 🤑). Even the big boys are paying around 15-20%, which is INSANE.

Now, here’s the JUICY part: after 13 trading days (T+13) on regsho, forced covering kicks in. That means shorts have to start buying back shares, which can send the price SKYROCKETING. 🚀📈

Check this out: On Feb 7th, BYND hit regsho and leading up to T+13, the stock’s price climbed and CLIMBED, until BOOM 💥💥 they covered their shorts and the price went nuts! Happened again on Apr 25th – stock price up, up, and AWAY until the shorts HAD to cover, causing another HUGE pump. 💣💥

Fast forward to NOW: BYND hit regsho on June 27th and history tells us this baby’s got some big moves coming. Sure, they might not pump exactly on T+13, but they gotta cover eventually. We've seen it take up to a month before, but the trend is clear: regsho = PRICE EXPLOSION! 💥💰

My positions? 8c July 19th, 9c July 19th, 10c Aug 16th, 12c Aug 16th. This is the regsho cash cow cycle, folks. Milk it responsibly 🥛.

536,1dqsdlb,2024-06-28 19:43:40,BYND Regsho Cash Cow Cycle,"Beyond Meat (BYND) is a heavily shorted company as many of you are aware with a high short interest of 39%+ its float.

On the start of June 27 th trading day BYND entered the regsho inclusion list where the stock has huge price increases on regsho.

What is regsho?

As defined in Rule 203(c)(6) of Regulation SHO, a “threshold security” is any equity security of any issuer that is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, or that is required to file reports under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (commonly referred to as reporting securities), where, for five consecutive settlement days:

 There are aggregate fails to deliver at a registered clearing agency of 10,000 shares or more per security;

 The level of fails is equal to at least one-half of one percent of the issuer’s total shares outstanding; and

 The security is included on a list published by a self-regulatory organization (SRO).

A security ceases to be a threshold security if it does not exceed the specified level of fails for five consecutive settlement days.

A security can be added on this because the failures to settle can be a sign of high shorting and improper naked short selling as you can see from the stock’s high short interest.

When BYND is on regsho it is extremely hard to short with limited liquidity and the high cost to borrow rate (IBKR’s retail fee

currently at 111.7216%), there is also a prime rate but that’s for the bigger players probably around 15-20% which is extremely high regardless. This can lead to an increase in the price of BYND.

After T+13 (13 trading days after its been included to the list) force covering begins where they are forced to cover the amount on the first day of regsho inclusion until the stock is off regsho.

The last two times BYND has been on Regsho the shorts ran the stock up on t+13 th day.

[BYND Chart and regsho trading days](https://preview.redd.it/lce8w2oo8d9d1.png?width=1777&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc37f1671f306c73c0986791d6c8a54739857199)

As you can see on feb7th BYND entered regsho (see teal lines on chart) and leading up to t+13 the stock’s price gradually increased and the t+13 th day they decided to cover all their obligations which lead to a huge pump.

This happened to be also the earnings day of bynd where they decided to use earnings as a cover.

FC on the chart stands for forced covering where they have to force cover their obligations.

FC +1 means they have to cover whats due on the first day of regsho.

FC +2 means they have to cover what’s due on the 2 nd day of regsho. Etc.

Fast forward to the last time BYND was on regsho on Apr25th (see purple lines on chart). Again the stock’s price increased leading to the t+13 th day of regsho where on the t+13 th day they covered majority of their obligations which lead to the huge pump

Now BYND has entered regsho on June 27 th where the regsho just about started. In the past this has lead to a huge priceincrease in the stock as the shorts are now incentivized to get off the regsho list by covering their obligations. Mind you they might not run the stock up on the t+13 th trading day, it could be earlier or later where they wait for earnings on Aug 1st or after it. Also the November regsho run it took 1month for them to run it up

So we got BYND on regsho and ETF FTDs that are coming due.

My Positions are: 8c July 19th , 9c July 19th , 10c Aug16th, 12c Aug16th

This is a regsho cash cow cycle. Milk responsibly.

Also this is not financial advice.

TLDR: BYND is on regsho and when on regsho it has lead to huge price improvements.",38,0.82

551,1dqo9s8,2024-06-28 16:48:00,"Five Below Shares & Leaps - You Don't ""Need Them"" But You Want Them!","TLDR; Five Below (FIVE) is down 40% on the year but it’s a hit with it’s core market, has executed well on store expansion (+70% store count in 5 years, including over Covid), and all negativity (Sometimes people steal stuff, TikTok is trendy) has been priced in. One opened in my neighborhood 6 months ago and everyone (kids, friends, grandparents, little league coaches, gang of ebike teens) loves the place. Long on Shares & Leaps.

**Tween & Teen Powered Growth**:

Five Below has a “unique focus on Teen and Tween” customers. Store locations align to this as well as their product offering. 

This place is nailing it. In our neighborhood using “we can go to Five Below” has become a reward dangled in front of children for great behavior, youth sport events, and general kid bribery. It's clear their offering hits on this with less expensive trendy products (think unbranded Stanley Mugs, Prime drinks, and popular character licensed gear). I love this place for the ability to get useful items but not break the bank. What used to be designate as a trip to Target has shifted to Five instead where we spend a fraction of the cost, get effectively the same things, and don’t have to walk past dozens of irrelevant departments.

While the offering is a unique focus that helps them build brand and drive store expansion, there is a ton of opportunity left on the table to cater to others in the family. Dollar stores also are hot for being recession proof.  

FIVE hasn’t even completed expansion in the US, notably they have no stores in the Pacific Northwest. Not to mention there has been no international expansion. Their expansion has come with no debt, new stores have minimal build out since fixtures are so basic and the merchandising aligns to a warehouse style clean look. The footprint works at nearly any size and they can slot into countless open leases as other retailers struggle in a downturn and are forced to close stores.

**Financials and Other DD**:

Four years ago one user wrote some great DD ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv05tm/five\_below\_going\_to\_drop\_hard\_on\_earnings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv05tm/five_below_going_to_drop_hard_on_earnings/)) and suggested buying puts since they had just made distribution center investment, couldn’t sustain store growth. Since that post they’ve grown store count by 75%, grown comparable store sales by 20% ($2.0M>$2.5M), grown EPS +144% ($2>$5+), peaked at +100% stock price ($108>$215), and are now trading at the same SAME value ($108).

There is already an approved outstanding $100M buyback that has been untouched. For a company delivering $5 EPS already it’s easy to see how a growth motivated leadership team would execute on this even if the rest of the store & revenue growth slows down. In the past few years they’ve done similar buy-backs at an average cost between $158-$162/share so no doubt they’ll be executing this and likely green lighting more.

Part of the value of Five Below is that the stores are easy to open, allowing for fast store growth. The footprint is only 9500 sq ft, which makes them easy to locate in dozens of struggling shopping areas where they can take over leases. Typically they are spending <$400k to open a store and have a one-year payback on the investment. Even after completing plans to expand to 3k stores with this model there is tons of room for new concepts of smaller or larger footprints that leverage the same distribution network they are building. Not that places like Dollar General has around 20k stores while even original WSB darlings have 6k+ stores.

50Day moving average just touched the 200day moving average

**Is it Just “$5 and Below”**:

No. The core SKU offering is based on quality low priced goods, primarily $5-$10.  That said my local store has expanded their “Five Beyond” in-store footprint to be \~25% of the square footage. There is plenty of upside to drive total $ per store up which would have a huge impact given that this metric has been flat over the past 24 months. Management has already said they expect this to drop in the short term, but this is baked into the guidance.

It’s been 5 years since “5 Below” moved to price some items over $5 and growth has still been solid. Despite the name there is no backlash to not adhering to a hard $5 cap on items and even in the face of inflation there are dozens of entry level items that will continue to be available at this price.

A big knock on the stock is that it is a physical retailer with minimal online presence. This makes sense though, even the behemoth Amazon struggles to compete in goods priced at this level. It’s nearly impossible for Amazon to make $$ on <$10 items due to shipping and the huge cost of returns. It’s a defensible fall back to have physical stores and funding a distribution network from this is a great move. Again I see this as a growth potential as they expand the price point of their offering distribution network that serves 1500+ retail locations in the continental US serves as a great basis to handle ecommerce orders reliably. 

**Risks**:

* The biggest hit to guidance came with notes about shrinkage being on the rise. This makes sense, the local store is often staffed by a single individual and tons of items are small and easy to hide. 
* Retail is a hard business. Specialty shops have their place but FIVE still has yet to show they can expand outside of trends/tweens. 
* Inventory management is hard. With store growth FIVE has better negotiating terms with suppliers, but also risks over buying trend items and having to discount them. Recent articles from Q2 earnings note difficulties here for things like Squishmallows and Faux Stanley cups (both driven by TikTok trends). Toys, Seasonal, and Trends are notorious for this but again here expanding out of just the Tween market to offer commodities for all helps reduce this risk as would a more “seek and find” approach of under buying trend items and making them foot traffic drivers with regular restocks. At the same time when other retailers over load on inventory with classic channel stuffing from manufacturers Five Below is in a position to gobble that up and resell it in their stores. Places like Ross Stores (equal store count but 10x market cap thanks to larger store foot print) have done great with this model.

Cyber Security Market. How is it possible that CrowdStrike is valued at 94 billion with 2.241 billion USD in revenue, while SentinelOne is valued at only 5.9 billion with 724.4 million USD in revenue? If we consider the multipliers used in Cyber M&A, assuming the average value, that is, 14x revenue, CrowdStrike should be valued at 30 billion while SentinelOne at 10 billion.

What does the market know that we don't? SentinelOne has reached breakeven and is now a profitable company that continues to acquire other companies.

597,1dqa3jo,2024-06-28 03:32:11,Rivian Founder in for a great deal if stocks huts 295$ per share,"2021 Equity Award to our Founder & Chief Executive Officer

In January 2021, our board of directors and stockholders approved an equity award to Dr. Scaringe consisting of a time-based option to purchase 6,785,315 shares of our Class A common stock and a performance-based option to purchase up to 20,355,946 shares of our Class A common stock (the “2021 CEO Equity Award”).

Our board of directors, in consultation with an independent compensation consultant, considered a number of factors in determining whether to grant the 2021 CEO Equity Award as well as the terms and conditions with respect thereto. Such factors include Dr. Scaringe’s then-current ownership interest in the Company, external market data for similarly situated executives among comparable companies, and the Company’s interest in incentivizing Dr. Scaringe to deliver on the Company’s strategy and align his long-term interests with those of our stockholders.

The time-based option vests in six equal installments on each of the first through sixth anniversaries of a Qualified IPO (as defined in the award agreement), subject to Dr. Scaringe’s continued service. The performance-based option vests in twelve installments contingent on the achievement of four stock price goals over a performance period that commences on the later of: (i) the sixth anniversary of the grant date and (ii) a Qualified IPO and ends upon the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The four stock price goals are, on a price-per share basis, $110, $150, $220, and $295, in each case as adjusted to reflect the impact of any stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalization or other changes in the corporate structure of the Company. Such stock prices reflect performance-based goals of approximately 5x to 13x increases in our stock price based on the $21.72 exercise price at the time of grant in January 2021.

Achievement of the stock price goals will be assessed on each of three assessment dates: the sixth, eighth and nine-year and sixth month anniversaries of the grant date.

The options each have a ten-year term and generally become exercisable as they vest. The options are also subject to certain forfeiture and accelerated vesting provisions with respect to all or a portion of the award in the event of a change of control, the definition of which does not include a public offering, termination of service to the Company and change in title from Chief Executive Officer to Executive Chairman or any other C-level title.

I can paper trade successfully with easy 20-30% gains, I take it to the real thing and lose it all. If I set my SL, the trade comes down hits my SL and goes right up past my TP. Whenever I don't set my SL it comes down and just keeps going down. If I avg down everything falls apart, If I don't avg down it seems to come back close to my entry, where if I did avg down would've been profitable. If I take the loss, it will just keep going past my entry. And yep you guessed it, If I don't take the loss maybe it keeps going, nope will turn around and die. I could sit here and say ""oh every time I do this the opposite happens blah blah"" but really its just my dumbass not staying patient or just being stupid and revenge trading. I have a couple trades each month that completely destroy my whole gains and eventually my port. I feel like If I keep going I am just going to eventually lose everything.

Don't worry, you don't need to actually read anything or do any research to win. Just remember this: it's false info meant to manipulate the retail market into picking the opposite direction the stock is going.

**Example:** Morningstar, professionals as they are, proclaim that Nike's fair market value is $129. The average Robinhood user will see this and think to themselves, ""Oh wow, Nike is only at $94 today going into earnings... that must mean it's undervalued and about to skyrocket once efficient markets kick in... What a steal, I should buy calls or shares!"" The only problem is: Nike nosedived after earnings today, going even lower to $88 vs it's ""fair market value"" of $129.

I've done a little experiment and tracked which way earnings have gone depending on the FMV. My theory was that the stock will continue to go in the direction it's already going vs the FMV.

Here are the results of my experiment (6 for 6) -

FMV = Fair Market Value Before Earnings,
Price DBE = Price Day Before Earnings,
Price DAE = Price Day After Earnings

- Nike: FMV $129, Price DBE $94, Price DAE $88 (so far), PUTS win
- FedEx: FMV $240, Price DBE $256, Price DAE $296, CALLS win
- Broadcom: FMV $1350, Price DBE $1493, Price DAE $1678, CALLS win
- Salesforce: FMV $300, Price DBE $272, Price DAE $218, PUTS win
- Walgreens: FMV $33, Price DBE $15, Price DAE $12, PUTS win
- Lululemon: FMV $285, Price DBE $308, Price DAE $323, CALLS win

There are of course counterexamples (Micron), but from what I've seen, it's pretty uncanny and very predictable which way a stock will go based on if the FMV is below the price (it'll keep going up) or above the price (it'll keep going down). I bet someone with more time on their hands could pull these same 3 numbers for every major earnings example, and see what the percentages are of the price following this pattern.

Not financial advice; I just have basic pattern recognition and ADHD.

My next play: First Solar (FSLR) - FMV $185, PBE $250 as of today, so my position is 7/26 $285 calls. (Earnings 7/25)

627,1dq1vio,2024-06-27 20:53:51,DD FCX,"Due Diligence: Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)

**Executive Summary**
Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) presents a compelling investment opportunity driven by the surging demand for copper, which is a critical component in the technology and renewable energy sectors. As a leading global copper producer, FCX is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing needs of AI companies, tech startups, and the broader electrification trend.

**1. Growing Demand for Copper**

A. Technology Sector and AI Boom

- **AI and Tech Startups**: The AI boom and the proliferation of tech startups are driving significant demand for copper. Copper is essential for the manufacturing of semiconductors, wiring, and other electronic components used in AI infrastructure and devices.
- **Data Centers**: The expansion of data centers, necessary to support AI workloads, further increases copper demand for electrical wiring and cooling systems.

B. Renewable Energy and Electrification

- **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: The shift towards electric vehicles is a major copper demand driver. EVs use significantly more copper than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles due to their electric motors, batteries, and charging infrastructure.
- **Renewable Energy**: Copper is critical in renewable energy systems, such as solar panels and wind turbines, as well as in the grid infrastructure required to distribute renewable energy.

**2. Strong Production Capabilities**

A. Diversified Asset Portfolio

- **Major Mines**: FCX operates some of the largest and most productive copper mines globally, including the Grasberg mine in Indonesia and the Morenci mine in Arizona. These assets provide a robust production base and economies of scale.
- **Geographic Diversity**: The company's mining operations span across multiple geographies, reducing risk and exposure to any single region.

B. Production Expansion Plans

- **Capacity Expansion**: FCX is actively investing in expanding its production capacity to meet rising copper demand. Projects like the Grasberg underground transition are set to significantly boost output.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiency and cost management are expected to enhance profitability and cash flow.

 **3. Favorable Market Conditions**

A. Copper Price Trends

- **Price Appreciation**: Copper prices have shown a strong upward trend driven by supply constraints and increasing demand. Analysts project continued price appreciation, benefiting major producers like FCX.
- **Inflation Hedge**: Investing in copper producers can serve as a hedge against inflation, as commodity prices often rise with inflationary pressures.

B. Supply Constraints

- **Limited New Supply**: The development of new copper mines is capital-intensive and time-consuming, leading to limited new supply coming online in the near term. This supply constraint supports higher copper prices.
- **Sustainable Practices**: FCX’s commitment to sustainable and responsible mining practices positions it favorably with regulatory bodies and environmentally conscious investors.

**4. Financial Strength and Shareholder Value**

A. Strong Financial Position:

- **Revenue and Profit Growth**: FCX has demonstrated strong revenue and profit growth, driven by high copper prices and efficient production.
- **Healthy Balance Sheet**: The company maintains a robust balance sheet with manageable debt levels, providing financial stability and flexibility.

B. Shareholder Returns

- **Dividends and Buybacks**: FCX has a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Continued strong financial performance is likely to support ongoing shareholder returns.
- **Investment in Growth**: Strategic investments in expanding production and improving operational efficiency are expected to drive long-term value creation for shareholders.


**Conclusion**
Investing in Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) offers a strategic opportunity to gain exposure to the booming demand for copper driven by the AI revolution, technology advancements, and the global shift towards renewable energy. FCX’s strong production capabilities, favorable market conditions, financial strength, and commitment to shareholder value make it a compelling choice for investors seeking growth and stability in the commodities sector.


TLDR: booming AI/tech needs copper. These markets keep growing so more copper needed. FCX produces a lot of copper.

Added benefit it is also used a lot in the market of renewable energy which is also getting a lot of support. Getting in this business is also costly to set up so they kind of have a moat built up through that.

628,1dq1tvz,2024-06-27 20:51:51,Carvana is getting squeezed,"A lot of people were convinced, and are still convinced (including myself), that Carvana is a dogshit business that is overvalued and that the stock will eventually crash. There has been convincing short seller research publicized with the short sellers taking hefty positions in Carvana at much lower prices compared to where Carvana is now. Everyone has been expecting Carvana to crash back down by now but it hasn't. You see, short positions have inherent risks that long positions don't have and the risks have to be actively managed. The market has been very strong recently and short sellers as an aggregate have been suffering. Based on recent price action, it seems like short sellers are reaching capitulation and are decreasing their short positions or entirely closing them out. I think Carvana is seeing unusually strong price action because short sellers are capitulating and closing out their shorts, resulting in higher and higher prices. 

I don't have a position in Carvana yet. I don't blindly short stocks without a catalyst in mind or some other way that I can determine if I'm right or wrong. If the market continues to be very strong, Carvana might continue to squeeze further. It's heavily shorted with the shorts being significantly underwater. One thing that should kill the squeeze is massive dilution, which should happen at some point. The family that controls Carvana is also pretty shady and I wouldn't put it past them to orchestrate a squeeze, sell their own shares, and then issue massive dilution after. It's worth watching this stock right now because a materially good news release can result in further short covering, while a dilution news event should cause a prolonged stock drop.

I'm thinking about buying Walgreens (WBA) stock, but I'm not sure if it's a good move right now. Walgreens dropped by about 25% in a single day recently, and I'm curious about the reasons behind it and if it might be undervalued now.

Here's what I've found so far:
- The drop happened after Walgreens reported a 25% year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings for Q3 2024. This was due to weaker consumer demand and some impairment charges from recent acquisitions
- some analysts think Walgreens is undervalued, estimating its fair value at around $24 per share, which is about 50% higher than its current price
- Walgreens has a high dividend yield of around 8.38%, which is great for dividend lovers like me. But they did cut their quarterly dividend from $0.48 to $0.25 per share recently 
- They're trying to stabilize revenue through cost-cutting and acquisitions, like Summit Health and Village MD, which seem promising
- There are also broader economic concerns like high oil prices and interest rates that could impact their performance 

So, given all this, do you think Walgreens is a good buy for a long-term, dividend-focused investor? Would love to hear your thoughts and any additional insights! Thanks!",14,0.77

651,1dpyak0,2024-06-27 18:24:21,Are we approaching the end of supermarkets due to increased shrink? And is Costco membership model the way of the future?,"With Walgreens $WBA preparing to shut down hundreds more of their underperforming stores in the US. I wanted to look at shrink levels of Costco.  


One of the first articles I came by from last month lays it out pretty good so I'll just copy some of the data from there. 

https://www.businessinsider.com/how-costco-limits-retail-theft-checks-reciepts-2023-5


>Walmart, Target, Dollar Tree, and other major retailers have warned of rising theft rates plaguing stores across the US.

>But one company appears to be immune to the problem: Costco.

>The warehouse chain's chief financial officer, Richard Galanti, said Thursday that **shrinkage — or inventory losses due to theft, fraud, or other causes — was largely unchanged.**

> Galanti said the company saw a slight increase after the rollout of self-checkout three years ago, but those rates have since reverted to the longer-term trend.

> *T*arget**, meanwhile, has said its losses from shrinkage will balloon to more than **$1 billion in 2023, up $500 million over last year.** Walmart's CEO said in December that stores would close if theft didn't slow. Dollar Tree said this week that it was considering locking up more goods in stores as it faces rising shrink.

>Overall, theft helps drive about **$95 billion in losses every year for US retailers,** according to estimates by the National Retail Federation, an industry group.



Costco has personal information on every customer that goes through their door. Their products are in bulky large packages. and so on... 

Gist of the matter is that lack of shrinkage these days is a huge competitive advantage which directly translates to increased profits. The more competition's stores close the more shoppers Costco gets. They can reduce prices more if they need to or keep selling it at the same price as their competition. It looks like they've cornered the market for the time being. 

Obviously dollar stores are leeches that prey on small towns in the US and they are unlikely to be affected by this. But how can Walmart for example keep growing or even prevent loss of revenue over the next few years until perhaps this theft trend changes. 


Another player in this category is BJ's Wholesale Club. With larger potential for growth and a much lower PE ratio (less than half) I believe a combination of these two stocks will be guaranteed winners in the next few years.

Normally I would stay the fuck away from cannabis stocks because I believe market dynamics of legalization will continue bring prices and margins down significantly.

However, I felt like I couldn't ignore a 21% 7 month out of the money call. Hitting the strike price would be beautiful, I would pocket the premium plus a 14.5% gain on the underlying stock. lthe stock has another 20% to drop before i'm starting to see losses. i figure they won't fold completely in the next 7 months though and the hit it took was just coming down from a temporary up-swing. 

what do y'all think?

695,1dpj3vj,2024-06-27 04:53:39,Nvidia: The only problem you're gonna have is that you didn't sell more.,"**Introduction**

Alright, so Nvidia is crazy overvalued right now. Just check out its P/E ratio – it's sitting at a whopping 73.94. And that's not all. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins.

**Growing Competition**

First off, the competition is heating up big time. 🔥 AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency. This is super important for data centers and AI applications, and it could seriously cut into Nvidia's market share. AMD is coming in hot, and Nvidia might end up feeling the burn. Then you've got Intel with their Gaudi3 GPU, which is packing some serious performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks. More people might start switching to Intel's GPUs, giving Nvidia a run for its money. Intel's Gaudi3 could be the ghost in Nvidia's machine👻​ 

**Lowered Margins**

Then there's Amazon, which is throwing its hat into the ring with custom GPUs for their EC2 instances. These GPUs are optimized for machine learning and AI, and they integrate perfectly with Amazon's cloud services. This seamless integration could mean less reliance on Nvidia's products, pushing Nvidia to cut prices to stay competitive. Lower prices mean lower margins, which isn't great for Nvidia's bottom line. Amazon could very well turn Nvidia's margins into margin call memes. 📉

https://preview.redd.it/wqo1b0dno19d1.png?width=302&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5e2aede9241706468a2d6f0a1b8b3cc4737ea25

Adding to the heat, TSMC is thinking about jacking up production fees for Nvidia. The chairman's plans to raise prices could eat away at Nvidia's margins even more. If TSMC hikes those fees, Nvidia might have to dig deeper into their pockets, and that could be a real pain in the margins. 💸 [Link (06/04)](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/TSMC-s-new-chairman-weighs-raising-production-fees-for-Nvidia)

So yeah, Nvidia's stock might be flying high right now, but with all this competition and pressure on margins, it might not stay that way for long. It's looking like Nvidia might be headed from tendies to tears if they can't keep up. 😂

**TL;DR**

Nvidia is trading high, but AMD, Intel, and Amazon are bringing the heat. 🔥 Competition + TSMC price hikes = potential margin squeeze. Stock might go from 🚀 to 💥 if they don't keep up. 😂

Grindr CEO George Arison has outlined plans for the location-based app will launch a new feature called ""Roam"" allowing users to temporarily place their profile in a new location ahead of a trip, in order to plan that trip.

* He also wants Grindr to connect its users to services, from restaurants to [fitness and health professionals](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/02/grindr-hires-athena-expansion), offered with a ""Grindr seal of approval.""
* ""Do you want to find a LGBTQ-friendly GP or therapist? Grindr will do that for you,"" Arison said.
* Users will also gain more options to differentiate their profiles: Someone looking for friends in a new city won't have to wade through everyone using the app for casual sex.
* The changes are being tested now in several markets and Grindr expects to launch them fully later this year.

Users have been ""hacking"" the app by inventing new uses for it --- from sourcing travel tips to monkeypox vaccines ---even though the app infrastructure itself barely changed.

* ""We're working to meet our users where they are,"" Arison said, ""We had not added any enhanced features for a number of years.""

Grindr currently around 14 million monthly active users worldwide, and a market capitalization of around $2 billion.

* Arison also said Grindr's growth markets are Latin America and Asia, but added ""In the US, almost 30% of Gen Z adults identify as queer. All of these people will need a tool for connecting with others.""

On AI:

* ""AI will fundamentally change how dating will be done, creating better ways of making connections --- and our users will decide exactly how,"" he said.
* ""We need to lead them there, through the opportunity to participate in piloting features, and giving users a clear choice of whether they want to use this technology.""

The CoWos advanced packaging tech from TSMC increased production capacity sizably, which is starting to lead to higher than expected revenue projections for Blackwell this year. 

Then there's the GB200 set for launch in the fall.

  
Anyway, not to digress too much - my post history is entirely NVDA due diligence at this point, so see that if you need catching up on other recent NVDA announcements. 

Otherwise the read is simple enough even for regards like me after watching GTC. Especially so after he started getting asked for titty signatures.

(NYSE: CHWY) (“Chewy” or “Company”), a trusted destination for pet parents and partners everywhere, announced today that it has agreed to repurchase an aggregate of 17,550,000 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a price per share of $28.49, which represents a 5.0% discount to yesterday’s closing price, resulting in an aggregate repurchase price of approximately $500 million (the “Repurchase”) from Buddy Chester Sub LLC, which is an entity affiliated with funds advised by BC Partners Advisors LP (“BC Partners”), Chewy’s largest shareholder. The repurchased shares will be cancelled and retired upon completion of the Repurchase.

Chewy believes today’s Repurchase is an accretive use of capital and provides an efficient mechanism to repurchase shares at a discount to the current market price, while further reducing the ownership position of the Company’s largest shareholder. Chewy’s increasing profitability and free cash flow generation enables the Company to further optimize its capital allocation strategy through this transaction, which comes in addition to the recently announced $500 million share repurchase program. This transaction together with the Company’s share repurchase program underscores the confidence Chewy has in the business and its compelling growth and margin expansion strategy. In light of Chewy’s expanding free cash flow generation, the Company will continue to assess options to opportunistically return cash to its shareholders.

The future can’t be delayed and is inevitable, You made it.
I see you are well off. I see mom and dad are taken care of. You are off the bus, driving a Black Benz. You are not working overtime mopping floors and cleaning toilets just to barely afford to rent someone’s basement.

The Universe never lied about a vision of a hungry man. You were a hungry young man in this vast universe but now, now the universe is within you. Remember this.

That’s what I gave you. I’ve set a chain of events in motion that got you here. 
Sorry to put you through the up and downs and the coarse nature of the path I set you on, but that’s the only way to reach the top - risk falling off the cliff. Bet you learned some shit. You’re welcome.
Just remember, you were here in somebody’s basement . You couldn’t afford school. You were in a foreign land, you’ve made it your home,a fish out of water, you haven’t seen your family in over a decade and counting. When you were serving at a restaurant, rich Highschool classmates acted like they don’t know you and left you $1 tip, you swallowed your tears as you wiped their table after they left. You couldn’t afford medicine for your mother. You were hungry. You cried to sleep, woke up in the morning to do a 15 hour shift. Women ignored you, old “friends” disrespected you when they saw you at the bus stop. You were lonely, your birthdays never existed, nobody made a toast to your health. Nobody invited you to Christmas, Thanksgiving or to parties. Don’t forget you wiped your tears off your phone screen as you typed this. 

But now you’re here. You’ve made it. I trust you’ve found a good woman and a great network of people who care about you and your purpose.
Now that you’re living in affluence,I hope greed didn’t consume your battered soul. Don’t forget to help others. All the opulence is vain if you are not sharing it.

","Here is some research I've gathered and compiled on the video game company GDEV/GDEVW and would like to share. Your feedback & commentary are most appreciated.

Disclosure: I’m long with 20 000 shares.

**TL;DR**

GDEV is one of the largest pure-play free-to-play (F2P) mobile and PC video game companies by bookings. It has a portfolio of large genre-leading franchises such as MMoRPG Hero Wars, FPS Pixel Gun 3D and puzzle game Island Hopper which position it well in a market that increasingly favours large brands and scale. Organic bookings and sales growth accelerated to +4% and +10%, respectively, in Q1 ‘24 and Q4 ‘23 representing the fastest growth of any peers. 

Record high audience expansion due to marketing efficiency with platform commission expense decreasing to a historically low level of 21.9%.  Share of the PC market has increased to 38% with 14 million Monthly Active Users (MAU) +17% year-over-year on all platforms.

Company is trading at a ridiculously cheap bargain price of 2$ at a valuation of 4x EV/EBITDA (peers 12x) and 0.5x EV/Sales (peers 1.5x) with high insider ownership.

**Cliff notes**

GDEV has three key franchises, under which it has several titles:

Hero Wars: Alliance (mobile, Hero wars: Dominion Era (PC), Island Hoppers (mobile and PC), Pixel Gun 3D (mobile and PC). GDEV has several games in development set to launch from late 2024 onwards. All franchises continue to deliver growth. 

With several growth levers at its disposal, Cantor expects GDEV to deliver mid to high single digit organic growth in 2024-2025, with potential for 10% growth, positioning GDEV with one of the highest organic growth outlooks in the peer group. As GDEV invests for growth, we believe their margins (2% EBITDA and 4% FCF in 2024) to climb to 20%-30% in the medium term. GDEV trades on a 0.5x EV/Sales versus peers on 1.5x, 4x EV/EBITDA versus peers 12x (ROVIO was bought by SEGA at 20x EV/EBITDA in 2023), with 40% of its equity value in balance sheet cash ($174m).

Cantor Fitzgerald has initiated coverage of GDEV with an outperform rating and a minimum $5 price target. They highlight that GDEV returned to positive organic bookings and revenue growth in Q4 2023 and will continue to deliver consistent positive mid to high single digit organic growth through 2024-2025 driven by robust user acquisition spending, a growing active and paying user base in existing titles and new game launches. 

Last but not least, GDEV has taken advantage of the market rout of 2023 and undergone a buy-back offer at 2$ to purchase undervalued shares which reduced its float by 17 million shares.

[FY2023 summary](https://preview.redd.it/0khj6uk4vy8d1.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=a34536ad8e4799ecbf744a9c2053b02846d2031a)

**Investment Thesis**

* Mobile and PC free-to-play market has stabilized after two years of declines, with growth resuming in late 2023 and Q1 24, and continuing into Q2 24.
* GDEV’s portfolio of genre-leading franchises, large user base and leading UA expertise leave it well positioned in a market that continues to favour large, established brands and scale publishers.
* Organic bookings growth accelerated to +4% in Q1 24. With several growth levers, organic growth is expected to accelerate to even 10% by FY 24-25.
* EBITDA margins will remain in the high single digit in FY 24-25 due to the investment, but long-term margins should reach 20%-30% offering material long-term profit upside
* With 40% of its market cap in cash, GDEV trades on a 0.5x EV/Sales (peers 1.5x) and has balance sheet optionality.
* The company is trading at around 4x EV/adj. EBITDA, which is way below peer valuations. It also generates decent cash flows from operations with a price target of at least 5$, an upside of 100%.

**History**

The company has certainly come a long way from its humble beginnings in 2010, which is when its founders first met. At the start of that decade, Fadeev was running a social games development studio, Progrestar, while Boris Gertsovskiy was putting the finishing touches to his plan to start a game business.

Within four years, Nexters was born and the company grew rapidly, particularly following the launch of its blockbuster title — Hero Wars — that first brought it international acclaim. However, it was the strategic decision of 2018 to scale on mobile that really powered the firm to the next level. Since then, Nexters has vastly increased its player base, revenue and team to total over 700 professionals, the bulk of them located in Cyprus.

>

GDEV is currently rated as one of the top-3 developers in Europe with **400+ millions** total game installs worldwide with hit games like Hero Wars, Pixel Gun 3D, Island Hopper and others.

[Marketing Growth Figures](https://imgur.com/mv8sJM4)

**What is Hero-Wars?**

The game follows a formula that many mobile gamers will be familiar with: it’s all about building up a team of heroes and watching them make their way through dungeons. If they’re not up to the challenge, you have to grind and enhance them, or you have to work to unlock other heroes who might be better suited to the challenge. It’s a game that’s really easy to get sucked into, filled with daily challenges that start easy and slowly become more and more difficult as you play and those who play it will soon find that it has become a part of their daily routine.

Throughout the year, Nexters has been actively engaged in its Hero Wars franchise. For example, they have divided Hero Wars into two games — the mobile Hero Wars Alliance and the browser-based Hero Wars Dominion Era. Recently they got a collaboration with Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider and have introduced Lara Croft as a character.

The company has released Hero Wars comic books and animated shorts like Rovio did with its Angry Birds franchise. Mobile games outlet Pocket Tactics included Hero Wars Alliance in selection of the best games in 2023 & 2024 and colleagues from PCGames included Hero Wars Dominion Era in selection of the 19 best browser games of the year!

**PIXEL GUN 3D on PC: The new Blockbuster**

[PixelGun3D](https://imgur.com/9sWytbj)

The PC version of Pixel Gun 3D was released on STEAM on April 2nd and it was one of the platform’s strongest game releases in a while. PG3D broke into the TOP-20 successful new releases on Steam and took first place among the best free-to-play games of April by the total number of players! It recouped all of its development costs within the first day, an unheard feat: 

* The game was launched on Steam April 2, entering on debut the Top 20 most sold and Top 50 most played games.
* The mobile version has already accumulated over $200 million in cumulative all-time bookings, while the PC version is just beginning its journey.
* The peak concurrent Steam users count reached 25,000 players on the first day of release.
* The Steam version of Pixel Gun 3D recouped its PC platform development costs within the first day of release, making 5 times the average daily in-app purchases of the mobile version.
* The results were achieved without significant marketing investments, capitalizing on strong brand awareness across the globe.
* 24k reviews on Steam estimating about 630k to 1.20m owners as of may 14th 
* The average session duration for Pixel Gun 3D on PC is an impressive 70 minutes per day, which is 3.5 times longer than on mobile devices!
* The retention rate on the first day is 30% higher than in the mobile version. What a result!

**Island Hopper and Block City Wars are upcoming blockbusters**

Highlights of Island Hopper:

* The game has made $47 million in revenue
* Over 20 million downloads to date
* Top 10 Farming Category free games (according to AppMagic data)
* Soft launched in 2021 with a global release late in 2023

There’s so much to do in this adventure game that features Emily, a distraught sister who sailed all the way to a mysterious island in search of her brother. Besides cultivating crops, you can take part in several minigames, go on thrilling camping trips, look for hidden treasures, and even try to uncover secrets of the island’s past. You will never run short of activities in Island Hoppers.

What is Block City Wars? 

It’s a reboot of the game Block City, originally released in 2016, a GTA-style open-world shooter in minecraft style for mobile platforms. This year, GDEV decided to completely overhaul the game, using all the experience gained from Pixel Gun 3D to turn Block City Wars into a world-class game. Combining a brand new approach to game design with familiar elements that made the original game popular, Block City Wars has made it into the top 10 best Roblox-like games according to PocketGamer!

[Block City Wars](https://imgur.com/evlbJEh)

First quarter 2024 highlights

* Revenue of $107 million decreased by 10% year-over-year.
* Bookings of $109 million increased by 4% year-over-year.
* Second consecutive quarter of bookings growth. 
* Loss for the period of $1 million in Q1 2024 vs. loss of $8 million in Q1 2023.
*  $129 million of available cash funds.
* Record high audience expansion due to marketing efficiency
* Share of PC platform increased to 38%
* Blended platform commission expense decreased to a historically low level of 21.9%
* 14 million Monthly Active Users (MAU) +17% year-over-year
*  Adjusted EBITDA of negative $3 million in the first quarter 2024 compared to negative $12 million in the first quarter of 2023.

>

GDEV continues to fire on all cylinders. Q1 2024 represents the second quarter of impressive bookings growth, the main metric to follow.  Lots of people still think that revenue is the most important metric in any business. for online service, the most important is bookings. 

For example you purchase an annual Microsoft Office subscription in a midyear. Microsoft includes half of this subscription payment as the revenue for this year and second half for the next year, but as a booking this payment will be reflected as a full cash inflow to the account.

In mobile/online games revenue is based on the distance the player stays in the game, that's why cash inflows or bookings are more relevant to assess the company as it's not tied with time and shows the real figures.

[Operating Highlights](https://imgur.com/6fim6Hk)

It's important to know that EBITDA is generally designed to show  the real profit of a company. By default, high EBITDA margins mean that a business can generate a lot of income from the revenue it makes, but in a free-to-play (F2P) model of the gaming industry there are several interesting nuances. 

1. Revenue: If a generous player pays say $1000 in a game today, you cannot recognize this money as revenue immediately, it has to be recognized gradually. 
2. Marketing Costs: for gaming companies marketing expenses are not just costs but investments. if a company sees an opportunity to invest more money in marketing today, it ensures revenue streams for long periods ahead, therefore significant marketing expenditures are good. 

A quite successful mobile gaming company may see  great potential in investing money in marketing, but revenue is recognized gradually while expenses are recognized immediately. As a result EBITDA is in the negative, but the company is in a positive position.

Cantor expects the global video game market revenue growth to reaccelerate in 2025 onwards to mid-single-digit growth, with 2024 being a year of stabilisation as companies focus on restructuring their cost base after years of over-investments. They see 2025 as a stronger year in terms of new large AAA releases including GrandTheftAuto VI and new hardware launches. mobile seems to be nearing a bottom, with market data and quarterly reports from listed companies looking more positive and suggesting that market growth is resuming in 2024 before improving in 2025.

The 2% decline in the mobile games market in 2023 is an improvement from the 5% decline in 2022. encouragingly, the US was flat in 2023 and 65% of the top 20 markets were flat to very modestly up in the year, prepping for a more bullish set-up in 2025.

According to Sensor Tower’s Q1 2024 Digital Market Index, quarterly mobile game spend surpassed $20 billion for the first time in two years — it reached $20.3 billion, up 2.9% year-over-year. Player spending on iOS grew nearly 6% year-over-year to $13 billion, while consumer spend on Google Play slightly declined to $7.3 billion (-1.3%).

**Concluding remarks**

GDEV is a great company with solid financials and a bright future trading at ridiculously cheap bargain prices of 2$ at a valuation of 4x EV/EBITDA (peers 12x) and 0.5x EV/Sales (peers 1.5x) with insiders having skin in the game. The company is critically underfollowed, so I would keep a close eye on the company given the strong Q1 2024 and bouncing back into growth mode.",9,0.68

751,1dp4z0m,2024-06-26 17:55:15,"Taking a closer look at the Rivian, Volkswagon partnership","Rivian Automotive (RIVN) and Volkswagen Group (VWAGY) have announced a significant joint venture that includes a substantial investment by Volkswagen in Rivian. This partnership aims to accelerate the development of software and electrical architecture for both companies, combining their strengths to lower costs per vehicle and enhance innovation on a global scale. Rivian's advanced zonal hardware design and integrated technology platform will form the foundation for this collaboration, which will benefit both automakers as they develop new vehicle models in the latter half of the decade.

Volkswagen plans to invest up to $5 billion in Rivian by 2026, starting with an initial $1 billion through an unsecured convertible note that will convert into Rivian’s common stock under certain conditions. This investment will help alleviate concerns about Rivian's financial stability, particularly given the company's recent losses and workforce reductions. The partnership will enable Volkswagen to leverage Rivian’s existing electrical architecture and software platform in the short term, while both companies aim to roll out vehicles utilizing the joint technology in the future.

First and foremost, the investment bolsters Rivian's liquidity, providing a lifeline to the startup as it navigates the challenges of scaling up production. The $7.858 billion in cash, augmented by Volkswagen's infusion, transforms the company's financial position, ensuring a solid foundation for the development of its R2 and R3 mass-market SUVs. By addressing short-term concerns, the joint venture paves the way for a more sustainable growth trajectory.The strategic benefits extend beyond capital. Rivian's cutting-edge technology, particularly its zonal hardware design and electrical architecture, becomes a valuable asset for Volkswagen. This integration accelerates both companies' software development, enabling them to create more efficient and cost-effective EV solutions. 

As a result, the partnership fosters a competitive edge, with both entities set to disrupt the mid-to-high-end segment of the market.The deal also implies a shift in market dynamics, as the collaboration signals a shift from standalone competition to a more cooperative model. Smaller EV manufacturers may feel the pressure to either enhance their own technology or explore similar strategic alliances to maintain their relevance. Legacy automakers like Volkswagen, now armed with Rivian's technology, are no longer spectators in the race for electric dominance.However, while the partnership is a game-changer, it's crucial to note that it doesn't guarantee an immediate turnaround for Rivian. The company must still execute effectively on its production optimization and cost structure improvements, as evidenced by the retooling efforts and efficiency initiatives mentioned. The future profitability of both parties will hinge on the successful integration and the ability to deliver on the promises of the joint venture.

Market reaction to the deal has been notably positive for Rivian, with its stock surging up to 50% in after-hours trading. Analysts have hailed the partnership as a game-changer, with Wedbush Securities raising its price target for Rivian's stock and highlighting the significant boost to Rivian's financial health and future prospects. Conversely, Volkswagen's stock saw a slight dip due to concerns over the size of the investment and its struggling software subsidiary Cariad. ",6,0.63

1. 2027 Projections:
   * Revenue: \~$700m (excluding new product offerings)
   * ADJ EBITDA Margin: 39-42% (includes new product costs, seems conservative)
   * Midpoint ADJ EBITDA: \~$290m
2. Free Cash Flow (FCF):
   * 70% conversion to FCF: \~$200m
   * Company guidance: $180m (using this to be conservative)
3. Valuation:
   * 20x multiple on FCF (conservative for a high-growth tech company)
   * Projected market cap: $7.8b
   * Projected share price: \~$50 in 2027
4. Growth Rate:
   * Current price: $11.48
   * CAGR to 2027 price target: \~19.51% per year

Why I think it's undervalued:

1. Conservative Guidance - Management seems to be underpromising, which could lead to overdelivering. They've consistently outperformed during earnings as well, and morning during their [investor conference](https://investors.grindr.com/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Grindr-Investor-Day-2024/default.aspx) they increased their revenue guidance for 2024 from revenue growth of at least 23% to at least 25%.
2. Debt Reduction: They should be able to pay down and refinance debt quickly with this cash flow. They've been making good progress here. [https://investors.grindr.com/files/doc\_financials/2023/q1/Grindr-Q1-2023-SHL-vF.pdf](https://investors.grindr.com/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/Grindr-Q1-2023-SHL-vF.pdf)
3. AI Potential: Their AI investments (like Wingman gen AI bot) aren't factored into guidance but could be huge.
4. Multiple Expansion: A 20x multiple is low for a company growing this fast. Any expansion could lead to significant upside.

Keep in mind: This doesn't even factor in the partnerships & ad revenue. Or the international expansion. These could make the stock worth $100

Risks to consider:

* Execution risk on new products
* Competition??

Pot stocks have been beaten down for years and are due for a major run. I see this as well as several other major catalysts coming up that could send MSOX into double digits.

1. Twitter/X is dead weight: It has been said elsewhere before but it is worth repeating that Elon buying Twitter was a mistake for everyone involved. Twitter was already an unprofitable company well before Elon took over, and his decisions have scarred off a lot of advertisers in having the space be less moderated (not to touch on the issue of how Elon being the face of Tesla has in voicing controversial opinions has made both other companies less willing to work with him as well as tarnished his image to much of the general public). It does not help Elon in any way to keep this website operating.

2. Cybertruck: The resources used to produce the Cybertruck were resources that could have been used to produce EVs that people wanted and were already buying, and or produce a next generation of electric vehicles for the general public. Less than 4,000 Cybertrucks have been sold since April and there have already been 4 recalls for the car.  

3. Tesla is facing increased competition both in places like the US as well as in China, and thus has to start a price war with a country known for selling very cheap goods.

Now. I am not saying that Tesla is doomed or that there will be a massive stock crash. But that in the next months the growth that Tesla will reverse as Tesla faces more competition, more controversy and especially with Twitter acting as an Albatross around Elon’s neck. What you are seeing now with the price increase over the last month could be some sort of short selling scheme to get people to buy Tesla Stock before it starts to come tumbling down.

Tesla isn't the only company that can survive in the space - Rivian demand is growing and they make a great vehicle. They have a strong offering so far, and with enough cash to survive, the R2 will do well and continue further growth into the R3.

Rivian's new partnership and investment with VW was inevitable, though it was uncertain which brand would partner with them.

Presentations by Grindr senior management will highlight its industry-leading performance and user engagement metrics, the Company’s new product roadmap that is powered by AI, and a four-year financial outlook.

“Grindr is unique because it was built by gay people for gay people. By focusing on our users over the past 15 years, we’ve achieved tremendous loyalty and engagement from them,” said George Arison, Grindr’s Chief Executive Officer. “Throughout our investor day, we will articulate the innovation we are planning in order to make our user experience even better and drive long-term growth. We are improving connection and casual dating, which have always been core to Grindr, through a suite of features called Right Now, while also creating new AI-first features to help users more easily find long-term relationships. We know our users want additional functionality to help them better access other types of social connections and to access curated, relevant information and services that will enhance the quality of their lives. Through new product expansions, we are creating ways for users to gain these experiences in the app.”

Grindr will present a multi-year product plan to build out additional functionality in its app. This includes developing eight new products for users to engage with Grindr’s core use cases of connectivity, dating, and relationships, and Gayborhood expansion use cases, which are new partnership-based digital services typically found in physical gayborhoods. To bring this vision to life, the roadmap leverages AI in a variety of ways, including the Grindr Wingman product.

Today, Grindr is increasing its revenue guidance for 2024 from revenue growth of at least 23% to at least 25%. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2024 of at least 40% remains intact. Looking out to 2027, with the Company’s new product plans designed to support the core dating business, Grindr expects to deliver 20-25% revenue growth annually through 2027, with Adjusted EBITDA margins in the range of 39-42%. Grindr’s expanded, partnership-based, digital Gayborhood services, including travel, wellness, and entertainment experiences, are not reflected in Grindr’s revenue outlook through 2027, though modest investments in these initiatives are factored into the company’s long-term Adjusted EBITDA margins.

“Grindr has built a durable financial model that is delivering strong, reliable growth as we execute on our monetization strategy,” said Vanna Krantz, Chief Financial Officer. “Our 2024 revenue guidance increase combined with the longer-term financial targets we are announcing today demonstrate our confidence in Grindr’s continued strong revenue growth and Adjusted EBITDA profitability even as we invest prudently in our product roadmap and new use cases. We believe our plans set up Grindr for significant profitable growth, cash generation and value creation.”",24,0.67

Rivian (RIVN) is poised for a surge, with the recent $5 billion investment from Volkswagen acting as a major catalyst. Here's why this could push the stock towards $30 in the near future:

* **Vote of Confidence:** Volkswagen's hefty investment is a resounding endorsement of Rivian's technology and future potential. This validation from a giant automaker significantly boosts Rivian's credibility and market confidence.
* **Cash Flow Lifeline:** The $5 billion provides much-needed capital for Rivian to ramp up production and expand its reach. This financial stability allows Rivian to focus on growth without the immediate pressure of cash burn.
* **Shared Expertise:** The partnership with Volkswagen fosters a powerful knowledge exchange. Rivian gains access to Volkswagen's vast manufacturing experience, while Volkswagen benefits from Rivian's innovative EV technology. This collaboration could accelerate development and innovation for both companies.
* **EV Market Momentum:** The electric vehicle (EV) market continues its strong growth trajectory. With rising gas prices and increasing environmental concerns, consumer demand for EVs remains high. Rivian is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.
* **Short-Term Boost:** The initial surge in pre-market trading after the Volkswagen news highlights the market's positive reaction. This momentum could continue in the coming days, pushing the stock price closer to $30.

While predicting the exact stock price is inherently challenging, the Volkswagen partnership injects significant optimism into Rivian's future. With a strong tailwind and strategic collaboration, Rivian's stock price has a compelling case to reach the $30 mark within the near term.

**Important to Consider:**

The stock market is dynamic, and external factors can influence Rivian's performance. Keep an eye on overall market trends, production updates, and any potential challenges Rivian might face.

789,1dowoqn,2024-06-26 11:50:52,Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price.

Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then.

People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings.

**But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment.**

Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and **I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons.**

Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in.

If you are a big tech company and want the best, cutting edge silicon you will have to switch to Intel foundry sooner or later.

Investing in Intel right now is like buying NVDA stock before the AI boom. ",4057,0.83

Started options trading approximately five years ago. I was watching my Roth, personal brokerage account, and 401k from work slowly go up. I got bored. So fucking bored. That’s kind of why we are all here, right? That and to get rich or whatever. Anyway.  Ended up blowing a few options accounts (luckily didn’t touch the 401k or Roth). Made some good money along the way, but not enough. Always wanted MOAR. Still do. 

After seeing my options gains slowly dwindle, and realizing that I was being too impulsive, I slowed down.

If you have a regular job that brings in income and aren’t relying on trading for your day-to-day expenses, this approach to options might help you to NOT LOSE money. If you’re looking to get rich quick and you’re unemployed - probs not for you.  

1. Don’t put money in your options trading account unless it’s down to zero. You’ll just end up with less money. There’s always a play, even with fifty bucks. 
2. Always withdraw when you can, and put it in your savings account. Play with house money. Unless you really want to full-time day trade, you don’t need that 25k in there. You might make more mistakes (I do, at least) when you feel like you’re “up.”
3. If you float around the ~5 to 10k amount, only buy one or two options contracts at a time. You’ll miss out on some huge gains, but you’ll not have huge losses. And along the way, in my experience, you can net $500 + a week. It seems so small compared to the gain porn posts on here, but when you withdraw that shit - nah. 
4. When you DO want to make a big play - have all your day trades available. 
5. If you can, pull some of the amounts you transfer from your brokerage to your bank out in CASH. There is something about it that helps you to remember that, yes - it is REAL money. 
6. Don’t tell anyone about it. 
7. Enjoy the casino with less stress, and more money in day-to-day life.

Reddit has 1/3 the market cap of Snap and Pinterest. Sure those companies are more mature and have much larger revenues but Reddit is soooo much a better investment. First, Reddit has no competition. Snap or Pinterest can easily get their lunch eaten by Tiktok or whatever next trendy app comes along. Meanwhile even the true regards over at r/RedditAlternatives have thrown in the towel and admit there's no alternative to Reddit. Of course reddit is never gonna compete with Insta or Tiktok due to low quality userbase (yeah I'm talking about you) and a medium less conducive to advertising. But it doesn't matter! Reddit only need to be 1/20th of meta for us to get rich.

Reddit is only gonna keep growing like the chode your wife loves so much. They got Google sending them giga traffic because of all the BS AI articles trying to game the search system. They got OpenAI about to start referencing reddit in their results. They got AI translation for their entire content to other languages for international expansion in testing.

Best part is how bad the current advertising on Reddit is. Some people say this is a negative but it's not, that's what makes this such an opportunity. I've seen how dog water Reddit ads were targeted a few years ago. Now it's merely bad. You're telling me they can't at least make it decent after a while? When communities are already separated by topic?

Half the analysts I see talk about Reddit on TV have no idea what's going on or what the site is other than it's an old school forum that's bad at selling ads. This screams opportunity, 5x is much more likely than 50%.

811,1dohb4s,2024-06-25 21:26:22,Nike Increase on earnings ?,"Nike's stock has taken a hit this year due to slower growth, and missed revenue in both Q1 and Q2. While Adidas  Sports and Under Armour might seem like their main rivals, their real rival is not an American company, but Chinese companies flooding the market with knockoffs. These cheap alternatives are extremely popularity for their affordability and amazing quality. You literally can not tell the difference between one of these knockouts and the real things

Recently, Chinese authorities cracked down on major counterfeit operations, including one of the biggest, PandaBuy. They raided warehouses and shut down factories, even arresting the CEO.  Not only was PandaBuy shut down, but others  just as big including one called HagoBuy. I'm assuming this crackdown left consumers scrambling, especially during important events like birthdays and celebrations.

 It’s so popular that I know people who use this site personally and were bummed out when they told me what had happened.  Sites were down and people wanted their clothing, birthdays, and celebrations were coming but where would they go?

Nike

Nike is one of the top options for teens/young adults. They have a large market share and correct me if I'm incorrect but they are the biggest by market cap. Nike is the most popular clothing store that has good clothing and is much better priced than their competitors. Their EPS forecast is relatively higher than last quarter, but I have no doubt that they will beat earnings.

There expected revenue is 12.87 Billion, which I think they will likely hit even if my thesis is wrong as they've seemed to just barely hit expectations these past 2 years, and there's no reason for them to miss earnings

This similar rational was used for me going long against Foot locker, which increased 25% in two days despite being much smaller.

Their earnings are on June 27 and I've bought 10% OTM Calls

If I'm right, I really recommend dumping your shares/options, as I'm sure fakes will start flooding the market again and Nike doesn't have what it takes in my opinion to grown exponentially over the years

This has improved all tech x1000. But what hasn't changed in 30 years? Your phone lithium ion battery. This is stopping you from being on Reddit all day at work when your phone dies. What's the solution??? ARCHITECTURE. All battery cells for 30 years are a ""jelly roll"" of cathode and anode layers rolled up into a cell. When you try to put silicon in there to expand the battery capacity the silicon swells up and breaks the battery. There are many shitco battery companies that never do anything and give the space a bad name. They are trying to fix this problem with complicated chemistry solutions. Enovix took the cathode/anode and sliced them into square layers and made a stack (like a sandwich) instead of a roll. This is the same way semi chips are made and stacked or so I'm told. They wrap it in a metal case and this structure can withstand and divert the force of any swelling of silicon. This allows >30% more capacity in a cell depending on its size. They have now replaced the whole leadership team with Qualcomm hardcore chip maker production guys and they are getting this damn factory running and shipping by next year. They are fielding sample orders from large megacap tech and phone OEMs. Today an agreement from a AR headset maker that the customer will pay for retooling to make the chips right for the headset. +30% pop today. These announcements are likely to continue IMO.    AI and LLMs and BLTs are all very power hungry to run. Apple already says they want to run AI on device. This needs better batteries.

834,1dobwi4,2024-06-25 17:40:56,INTC and AMD,"**Thesis: AMD ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) are Undervalued Stocks**

In the dynamic and highly competitive semiconductor industry, AMD ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) have demonstrated remarkable resilience, innovation, and market presence. Despite their solid fundamentals, both companies appear undervalued when considering their current market prices relative to their intrinsic value, future growth potential, and industry positioning. This thesis will explore the reasons behind this undervaluation, focusing on financial performance, strategic initiatives, market trends, and competitive advantages.

### Financial Performance and Valuation Metrics

1. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratios:**
   - Both AMD and Intel have P/E ratios that are below the industry average, suggesting that the market has not fully recognized their earnings potential. AMD's forward P/E ratio is around 25, while Intel's is approximately 12, compared to the semiconductor industry average of 30-35.

2. **Revenue and Earnings Growth:**
   - AMD has exhibited robust revenue growth, driven by its strong product portfolio and increasing market share in both consumer and data center segments. The company's revenue grew by over 20% year-over-year in the last few quarters. Intel, despite facing competitive pressures, has maintained stable revenue streams, with significant contributions from its data center and Internet of Things (IoT) segments.

3. **Cash Flow and Profitability:**
   - Both companies generate substantial cash flows, supporting their ability to invest in R&D and return value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. AMD's free cash flow margin stands at around 10%, while Intel's is approximately 20%.

### Strategic Initiatives and Technological Advancements

1. **Product Innovation:**
   - AMD's Ryzen and EPYC processors have gained significant traction, challenging Intel's dominance in the CPU market. The company's advancements in 7nm and 5nm process technologies have positioned it as a formidable competitor in both consumer and enterprise markets.
   - Intel has made strides in expanding its product lineup, with significant investments in AI, machine learning, and autonomous driving technologies. The introduction of its Alder Lake processors and advancements in 10nm and future 7nm nodes signal a robust product roadmap.

2. **Strategic Acquisitions:**
   - AMD's acquisition of Xilinx is expected to enhance its capabilities in adaptive computing and bolster its presence in key growth markets such as 5G, automotive, and aerospace.
   - Intel's acquisition of Mobileye and investments in autonomous vehicle technology underscore its commitment to diversifying its revenue streams and capitalizing on emerging tech trends.

### Market Trends and Competitive Landscape

1. **Demand for Semiconductors:**
   - The global semiconductor market is projected to grow significantly, driven by increasing demand for high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and IoT applications. Both AMD and Intel are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends.

2. **Competitive Positioning:**
   - AMD's competitive pricing and performance advantages have enabled it to gain market share from Intel, particularly in the desktop and server CPU markets. Intel's extensive ecosystem and strong brand equity continue to make it a preferred choice for many enterprise customers.

### Underappreciated Catalysts

1. **Supply Chain Resilience:**
   - Both companies have demonstrated resilience in navigating the global semiconductor supply chain challenges. AMD's partnerships with TSMC and Intel's plans to build new fabs in the US and Europe are strategic moves to mitigate supply risks and ensure capacity for future growth.

2. **Expansion into New Markets:**
   - AMD's foray into gaming consoles with partnerships with Sony and Microsoft, as well as Intel's advancements in the data center, networking, and edge computing, present substantial growth opportunities that are not fully reflected in their current valuations.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, AMD and Intel are undervalued stocks, with market prices that do not fully reflect their intrinsic value, robust financial performance, strategic initiatives, and potential for growth in the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry. Investors should consider the compelling investment case for both companies, driven by their innovation, competitive positioning, and resilience in the face of industry challenges. As the global demand for semiconductors continues to rise, AMD and Intel are well-equipped to deliver sustained value, making them attractive opportunities for long-term investment.",70,0.81

So why IMAX you ask?  Because AMC is a disaster financially and you probably already missed the big run up in CNK, Yet IMAX is still trading well below its 52-week highs with a price target of $23 – a 35% increase from its current price.  IMAX also has the best patented tech in the industry with a global brand that continues to grow market share in every corner of the world.  IMAX is the Apple of the movie industry.

So why now?  Because movie theater stocks almost always perform well during the summer blockbuster season.  Especially when they start the summer a discounted stock values and particularly when when the biggest action films of the year are just around the corner -- and that's proving itself out once again this year.  And now we are just days away from A Quiet Place Day One opening this weekend – followed by Despicable Me4, Twisters2, and capping the summer blockbuster slate with Deadpool/Wolverine which is expected to delivery a $200M opening weekend.     

If any of these titles hit paydirt – IMAX will be well rewarded between now and Labor Day.  Get your popcorn out.  Good luck and Happy Trading. ",0,0.45

Rivian is up 6% today off of an analyst upgrading to an $18 price target. Their investor day is this Thursday, which will likely see more analyst upgrades and possibly some big announcements on their partnership with NVIDIA.

Crucially, their stock spiked to over $25 last year in the week following their investor day when the stock was in a similar spot - beaten down to near all-time lows by negative sentiment that hadn’t yet caught up to positive indicators.

839,1doapt1,2024-06-25 16:50:48,McDonald's $MCD,"# McDonald's: A Top Dividend Growth Play

*  McDonald's has achieved 13 straight quarters of revenue growth, despite high inflation hurting consumer spending.
* The fast-food chain plans aggressive expansion, with a goal of reaching 50,000 global restaurant units by FY 2027.
* McDonald's is a 'Dividend Aristocrat' with consistent profitability and potential for dividend growth.

  
The company continues to see consistent, low-single digit growth in revenues and is aggressively expanding both domestically and internationally. With moderating inflation and a strong unit growth plan for FY 2024 and beyond, McDonald’s has significant potential for top-line expansion. Additionally, shares trade below the 1-year average price-to-earnings ratio, suggesting a favorable risk profile for long-term investors.

McDonald’s, a multinational fast-food giant with over 40,000 locations in more than 100 countries and a market cap of $185B, has shown 5% year-over-year revenue growth, achieving $6.2B in the first fiscal quarter. Despite decelerated revenue growth due to inflation, the company still saw a 2% increase in comparable sales in Q1'24, driven by menu price increases, marketing, and customer traffic. The reintroduction of the $5 meal aims to boost foot traffic in U.S. restaurants.

https://preview.redd.it/x6g8gh3ryq8d1.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4ec84173238b75ded8f3c82ea9371f6cd26429

As inflation moderates, increased purchasing power could accelerate McDonald's comparable sales growth. A reversal of the recent downward trend in comparable sales could significantly enhance the investment appeal of McDonald's shares and potentially drive a revaluation of its share price.

The biggest risk for McDonald's is the trajectory of inflation. Persistent inflation in the second half of the year could continue to pressure consumers. To attract more customers, McDonald’s, in cooperation with its franchisees, has reintroduced its $5 value meal. However, a resurgence of inflation in the third and fourth quarters could pose a significant risk to the company's comparable revenue growth.

Been balls deep in GRND research lately, and I'm starting to think we're sleeping on a rainbow gold mine here.

Grindr's investor day is tomorrow, and these guys are talking about building a wholeass ""global gayborhood"" in your pocket. We're not just talking dick pics and ""I'm horny"" messages here - this could be the Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp for the LGBTQIA++. Most recently they're expanding into travel because apparently gays travel a lot.

George Arison is a Gigachad baller CEO. I watched his interviews. He's a human catalyst for getting shit done.

[gay bear CEO](https://preview.redd.it/7gn0yj5qkq8d1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=82463c096e386577fe0ec126d9a0e2a59199ae03)

He's been teasing AI and machine learning shit they've been testing, which sounds like it could print money if they get it right. We all know gays love to roleplay and pretend, so lots of potential in this Gay-AI. Even if their AI-wingman feature is just some horny twink bot, it's a revenue stream waiting to happen...

Another thing is that they're only monetizing 7% of their users right now. SEVEN PERCENT. That's like leaving money on the table. They recently tried changing their pricing model to offer weekly subs and bam... 16% increase in revenue per paying user. Just like that. 💅 The CFO also said earlier this month that AB testing revealed prices are more inelastic than expected in the US, so they can clearly still increase revenue by optimizing their pricing.

Now I'm not saying GRND is gonna Uranus 🍑 overnight. But consider this: Match Group is trading at 5x Grindr, but Grindr's extending far beyond dating, their users are spending 2x the time on the app, gays are statistically richer and hornier, and tap water is turning everyone gay these days. You do the math.

852,1do75ai,2024-06-25 14:19:28,$ZI Buyout or News Catalyst Incoming? Unusual Activity.,"Very unusual options activity for August, Stanley Druckenmiller and a few other top fund managers heavily increasing their positions. Company is FCF positive, currently running a share buyback, smells like a buyout.

Firstly, $ZI attracted a little retail attention when Stanley Druckenmiller bought in (If you don't know who he is look him up).  After substantially decreasing his position in $NVDA his largest % increase was in $ZI. Bare in mind he was one of the first into NVDA and to actively inform the public why he thought it was such a good bet.

His most recent 13f shows that he increased his position by 500% and has an average share price of $17. Earnings were then released and the stock tanked, pretty common in current conditions for a software name.

He wasn’t alone in his aggressive purchase, infact, the below super investors also increased their positions:

**David Shaw**  by 266%

**Israel Englander** by 129%

**Joel Greenblatt** by 407%

 All of which have solid track records, feel free to investigate them yourself.

 **But this is when it gets very interesting…**

On the 15^(th) May the open interest across most strikes was low, almost no activity, especially the August strikes. Yet that all changed at a very rapid pace.

 15^(th) May the open interest for the $15 August strike was just a single contract.

 16^(th) May this jumped up too 19,315 in practically a single block

Fast forward to the 11^(th) July and it jumps up to 39,380

 That’s just for the $15 strike..

 The $16 strike had 171 open interest on Monday last week, today it's 20,700 and again looks to be  a single buyer. With just a few small orders copying the buy.

Now $14 is getting scooped in large quantities and the $13.

Leaving the following for 53 days out:

13 strike - 10,221 OI (1,000% increase in 10 days)

14 strike - 15,362 (500% increase in 10 days)

15 strike - From 1 to 41,033 in 30 days

19 strike - From 0 to 37,136 in 30 days

The rest of the chains have very

To me this indicates that somebody is obviously aware of a catalyst that's due to happen before that date, otherwise you’re likely to go further out (longer dates) or closer to in the money when putting on such size. My best bet would be a buyout target of $18-$19 based on the strikes chosen. Like I say, this is a calculated guess. Had this play been made for much further out contracts I’d be less suspicious. However, buying 70,000+ contracts for <60 days out clustered around the same strike is a huge green flag.

Now they're hitting the shorter dated too, July's, check todays flow so far. It's getting completely absurd at this point and to me it looks like block orders (a small group of buyers).

As the saying goes, somebody always knows.

What gives me more confidence is the company continues to outperform, has a healthy balance sheet and produces more and more free cash flow each year.

**Free Cash Flow:**

2023 $408

2022 $388m

2021 $275m

2020 $152m

2019 $30m

Cash on hand: $400m 

Current Share Buyback plan still operating.

The company is founder-led by Henry Schuck, rather than me regurgitate a load of information you can view the companies latest results here.

[https://ir.zoominfo.com/static-files/d7e521f0-7040-460b-bfd6-3d1940ac7a5d](https://ir.zoominfo.com/static-files/d7e521f0-7040-460b-bfd6-3d1940ac7a5d)

32.57% of the float is held by insiders with very tiny activity this year. If they were concerned about the companies share price being a real reflection of the business, I’d expect to see some of that enormous interest exiting. Given the latest numbers, I’m not surprised they remain bullish.

So what I’ll be doing is simple, positioning with some short dated calls accompanied by shares. I've gone for shorter dated because I'll buy again in 30 days If the buyout doesn’t happen.

Notes: I may be completely fucking wrong about everything above.

1. FedEx has reduced costs by eliminating daily overtime and double time

2. Weekly guaranteed minimum pay for non-driving positions has been eliminated

3. The 5B share buyback plan is only halfway completed. This meaning that FedEx still has $2.5B to buy back

4. FedEx is implementing a new wave of AI cameras in the contractor trucks. Everyone knows that AI is bullish.

5. FedEx has closed many stations over the last year, with many more likely to come. These closures included layoffs. Both of these are bullish

The negatives

1. The loss of the USPS contract will decrease yearly revenue by $2B. However the contract was not that profitable and FedEx will be able to reduce expenditures on the extra mail flights that will be eliminated

Rationale:

1) Bearish engulfing pattern: but bearish engulfing pattern has occured few times [latest being on 10th March, 2024] and the stock has rebounded strongly to scale new ATH
2) PE stretch in AI/Tech : PE multiples of Nvidia and related tech co [Broadcom, SMCI, Micron etc] have expanded sharply and there are concerns if revenue and profits can keep pace. But this may be revealed in next earnings cycle only.
3) General exhaustion with tech/AI: investors are taking profit and looking to invest in different opportunities. The fact that DOW rose and S&P remained steady [since 20th June] means the money still remains in the market.
4) Pull backs are healthy: it allows market/investors to reassess  the stock. Short term traders exit while provides attractive entry points for long term investors.

*I had pointed in one of my previous posts to shed concentration in AI/tech and to seek different opportunities.

Funds have been reported to rotate money out of tech/AI into energy, [surprisingly] bank, and other defensive stocks.

Crypto, cryto ETF, and crypto related stocks have tumbled because of  no rate cut expectations for Q3, '24.

I believe Gold may stay range bound or face a mild correction in weeks to come.

Meme stocks seem to have lost steam as investors attention shift to other opportunities.

What to do? 

Nvidia [now at pre split level price] and others now are attractively priced compared to previous week. This correction presents an attractive opportunity for long term investors.

Keep AI/Tech concentration < 50%

Seek different opportunities and even defensive stocks [Berkshire, Walmart, Mondelez, General Mills, Chubb, 3M etc]

I knew the gheys would be out and about in full force especially after today.  Sure enough, I get out of work and see there already are some unhinged DMs/comments waiting, or asking for an update.

I sold none of them, and in fact added a couple more Nov '24 leaps during lunch today.

I've already made \~10 posts at this point over various NVDA news/announcements in the past quarter, along with DD posts on the progression of this YOLO that started from \~$38k, went to as high as $172k and is now down to $105k.

I'm not repeating all that again, or listing more objective reasons simply because there's been no fundamental reason driving this sell-off other than:

a) profit-taking

b) quarterly-end rebalancing

c) sell the news factor after NVDA briefly toppled MSFT

All I'm gonna say is - Blackwell revenues for this year are going to be nuts, and it'll become clear in the next earnings call. If there ever was a time to load up on the dip (and I mean either leaps, or shares -- not regarded weeklies), it'd be now.

Apr ‘24: $75.61

Jun ‘24: $140.76
Today: $118.11
Current correction: -16%

I could see NVDAs current correction still having 500 bps of downward movement. If the investor relation event wasn’t this week I’d be even more certain of it. 

Positions: I recently scalped $1000 off NVDA with 6/21 Puts, and sold 10 shares at $138. 

In short, I think NVDA corrections usually will be greater than 20%. Not financial advice - do what you will with this. Cheers

FedEx is facing challenges just like every quarter, weaker demand, etc, despite these hurdles, FedEx has been focusing on cost-cutting measures to improve its bottom-line performance.

What they have done to improve these challenges? 

Cost-Cutting Measures:

1. DRIVE Program: FedEx launched the DRIVE program, a comprehensive cost-cutting and efficiency-improving initiative. This program aims to streamline operations across its transportation segments, lower overhead costs, and enhance digital capabilities. These efforts are expected to result in significant long-term savings and improved profitability. 

2. Operational Efficiencies: FedEx has focused on improving operational efficiencies within its various units, particularly in FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. By optimizing routes, reducing unnecessary expenses, and leveraging technology, FedEx aims to enhance service levels while cutting costs.

Strategic Adjustments

1. Volume Management: Despite a weaker demand environment, FedEx has been actively managing its volume levels to match capacity more effectively. This includes adjusting flight schedules hedules and reducing underutilized assets to better align with current demand trends.

2. Rate Increases: To offset some of the financial pressures from declining volumes, FedEx has implemented rate increases for its services. This helps to maintain revenue levels even as shipment volumes fluctuate. 

FedEx and artificial intelligence… 

FedEx has indeed been integrating artificial intelligence (Al) into its operations to improve efficiency, enhance customer experiences, and streamline logistics processes. Here are some key areas where FedEx is utilizing Al:
Predictive Analytics and Automation

1. Routing and Logistics: FedEx uses Al to optimize routing and logistics. By analyzing large datasets, Al helps FedEx predict the most efficient delivery routes, reducing transit times and fuel consumption. This improves overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.

2. Package Sorting: Al and machine learning algorithms are employed in FedEx's sorting facilities to automate the process of package sorting. This enhances accuracy and speeds up the handling of parcels, particularly during peak seasons .

Cute of them to think Jensen gives a fuck about your petty politics. “On first principles, we’re a company created for business”, he said in some regarded Q/A a couple months ago when the gheys were raving about the China ban.

On a serious note, he has to be doing this after some sort of green light from the White House. 

So business as usual starting tonight in the market as well with NVDA. Got the little break/cooldown/consolidation/spinach dip — whatever other horoscopic shit you wanna call it, Thursday and Friday. 

The selloff was prompted by no bad news, and now we’ve received bullish news before the week even starts — I imagine Jensen will hype Blackwell up with a cool update or two during the iNvEsToR’S meeting (regards) as well. Plus there’s MU earnings and PCE data this week.

Must’ve forgotten there’s an election in 4 months. Ban-shpan, who cares.

936,1dmal2m,2024-06-23 01:12:28,Thesis: The Reflection of Stock Market Patterns in Everyday Objects: A Study of Fractal and Chaotic Similarities,"# Abstract

This thesis explores the intriguing observation that patterns typically seen in stock market charts can also be identified in everyday objects, such as the torn edge of a piece of cardboard. By examining the principles of fractals, chaos theory, and human psychology, this study aims to highlight the pervasive nature of self-similar patterns across different contexts. Understanding these connections not only enhances our appreciation of natural and financial systems but also offers insights into the underlying mechanisms that drive complex patterns in diverse environments.

# Introduction

Patterns are a fundamental aspect of both natural and human-made systems. In financial markets, technical analysts use chart patterns to predict future price movements. Interestingly, similar patterns can often be seen in nature and everyday objects, suggesting a deeper connection. This thesis investigates the hypothesis that stock market patterns can be observed in the physical world around us, using a torn piece of cardboard as a primary example.

# Literature Review

1. **Fractals in Nature and Markets**
   * Fractals are structures that exhibit self-similarity, meaning their patterns repeat at different scales. They are ubiquitous in nature, appearing in forms such as coastlines, mountain ranges, snowflakes, and plant structures (Mandelbrot, 1982).
   * In financial markets, fractals are evident in price movements on different time scales, where short-term fluctuations mirror long-term trends (Peters, 1994).
2. **Chaos Theory and Market Dynamics**
   * Chaos theory explains how complex systems can exhibit both random and deterministic behavior. This theory has been applied to various fields, including meteorology, biology, and economics (Gleick, 1987).
   * In the context of financial markets, chaos theory suggests that small changes in market conditions can lead to significant and seemingly unpredictable price movements, yet these movements often follow underlying patterns (Mandelbrot & Hudson, 2004).
3. **Psychological Patterns**
   * Human psychology plays a critical role in both market behavior and everyday actions. Behavioral finance studies how psychological factors influence investors' decisions, leading to predictable patterns in market movements (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).
   * Similar psychological principles can influence mundane actions, such as tearing a piece of cardboard, resulting in patterns that mirror market trends.

# Methodology

To explore the hypothesis, this study uses a qualitative analysis of a torn piece of cardboard and compares its pattern to typical stock market charts. The analysis focuses on identifying common patterns such as downtrends, uptrends, breaks, and retests.

# Results

1. **Visual Comparison**
   * A torn edge of cardboard exhibits jagged, irregular lines that often slope downward initially, then shift upward. This resembles a market downtrend followed by an uptrend, with small corrections and retests.
   * In stock market charts, a downtrend (series of lower highs and lower lows) can be followed by a reversal into an uptrend (series of higher highs and higher lows).
2. **Breaks and Retests**
   * The cardboard tear shows points where the tear line changes direction or has small breaks, similar to market corrections or consolidations.
   * On the stock chart, these breaks and retests represent areas where the price tests previous support or resistance levels before continuing in the trend direction.

# Discussion

The similarities between the torn cardboard edge and stock market charts can be explained by the principles of fractals and chaos theory. Both systems exhibit self-similarity and follow underlying deterministic rules that create complex, yet patterned outcomes. Additionally, human psychology influences both market behaviors and everyday actions, leading to the formation of similar patterns in different contexts.

# Conclusion

This study demonstrates that patterns typically seen in stock market charts can also be observed in everyday objects like a torn piece of cardboard. The presence of fractal and self-similar patterns across different domains highlights the interconnectedness of natural and financial systems. Understanding these connections offers valuable insights into the mechanisms driving complex patterns, enhancing our ability to predict and interpret both market behaviors and natural phenomena.
