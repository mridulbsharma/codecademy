0,1719883794.0,Games to play before 100 - need help deciding on a few updates,"Hi folks,

A couple of months ago I posted a curated list called 100 Tabletop Games to Play Before turning 100 here and to BGG. It got some decent traction and some excellent feedback. I had a chance to compile all the comments and have been working on a list of potential changes. I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on the potential changes and which ones I should push through. 

The current list:

[https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/321471/100-tabletop-games-to-play-before-turning-100](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/321471/100-tabletop-games-to-play-before-turning-100)

The original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1cj085j/100\_tabletop\_games\_to\_play\_before\_turning\_100/](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1cj085j/100_tabletop_games_to_play_before_turning_100/)

And here are the changes I am considering. DISCLAIMER: the pros and cons listed are meant to be a summary of reasons for or against the changes that I have heard. I've tried to keep my thoughts out of it as best as possible. Let me know if you have thoughts about them and which ones I should follow through with.

Replacing

* Replacing [Pit](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140/pit) with [Wheedle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5393/wheedle). Pro: more decisions. Con: not as easy to get a hold of.
* Replacing [Camel Up (Second Edition)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/260605/camel-up-second-edition) with [Winner's Circle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1382/winners-circle). Pro: more space for agency. Con: less easy to get into.
* Replacing [Splendor](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor) with [Knarr](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/379629/knarr). Pro: Knarr improved upon Splendor. Con: Splendor is the classic here.
* Replacing [Dominion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion) with [The Quest for El Dorado](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/217372/the-quest-for-el-dorado). Pro: El Dorado is more approachable for players new to deck-building. Con: Dominion is the original and a ""more pure"" form of deck-buildling. Overlap with [Dune: Imperium](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/316554/dune-imperium).
* Replacing [Poker](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1115/poker) with [Skull](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/92415/skull). Pro: Skull is more approachable and distills bluffing to its core. Con: Poker is ubiquitous without falling to the unfun trappings of other mass appeal games.

Removing

* Removing [Android: Netrunner](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124742/android-netrunner). Pro: covered by [Magic: The Gathering](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/463/magic-the-gathering) and [Arkham Horror: The Card Game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/205637/arkham-horror-the-card-game). Con: sufficiently different and unique from aforementioned games.
* Removing [Pit](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140/pit). Pro: trading already covered, real time covered a lot. Con: no game quite covers both.
* Removing [Just One](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/254640/just-one) or [Codenames](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames). Pro: great deal of overlap in mechanics. Con: one is team based and the other cooperative.
* Removing [Magic Maze](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/209778/magic-maze). Pro: limited communication and real time are already present. Con: would push Magic Maze and its contenders under something like [Hanabi](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi) or [Captain Sonar](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/171131/captain-sonar) which feels a bit odd.
* Removing [Backgammon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2397/backgammon). Pro: roll and move doesn't need a spot on the list. Con: roll and move is good when done right and Backgammon is an example of a mass market game that lives up to its popularity.

Splitting

* Splitting [Can't Stop](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41/cant-stop) and [No Thanks!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12942/no-thanks). Pro: No Thanks is a different kind of pushing of luck. Con: list doesn't have room for two push your luck games.
* Splitting [Gloomhaven](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven) from traditional dungeon crawls like [Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104162/descent-journeys-in-the-dark-second-edition) or [Cthulhu: Death May Die](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/253344/cthulhu-death-may-die). Pro: Gloomhaven is much puzzlier and feels different from traditional dungeon crawlers. Con: Gloomhaven taps into the desirable aspects of the genre despite its unique mechanisms. Those mechanisms do need to be explored or are already covered with [Memoir '44](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10630/memoir-44).

Adding

* Adding [Hansa Teutonica](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/43015/hansa-teutonica). Pro: evergreen and deserves its own spot. Con: somewhat shares space with a few Euros on the list and currently mentioned under [Brass: Birmingham](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/224517/brass-birmingham).
* Adding a global conflict game like [Risk](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181/risk), [Axis & Allies](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98/axis-and-allies), [Nexus Ops](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15363/nexus-ops). Pro: these games are significantly different from [Memoir '44](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10630/memoir-44), [Diplomacy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/483/diplomacy), and [Warhammer 40,000 (Fourth Edition)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13362/warhammer-40000-fourth-edition). Con: either they are not that different or they simply not fun depending on who you ask.
* Adding a train game like [Wabash Cannonball](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31730/wabash-cannonball) or [Shikoku 1889](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/23540/shikoku-1889). Pro: these games have their own genre and dedicated fandom. Con: [Acquire](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5/acquire) is already on the list and serves as a good entry point.
* Adding [Thousand Year Old Vampire](https://boardgamegeek.com/rpg/51034/thousand-year-old-vampire). Pro: representing solo game and RPGs a bit more on the list. Con: solo and RPGs already covered on the list.",boardgames
1,1719883105.0,NEED Carcassonne box,"I've printed carcassonne (base version), using self adhesive printing paper and 2mm cardboard for the tiles, and 3d printer for the meeples. I just need the box to finish this small project, but I can't find good quality images anywhere. I would like to get some scans of the box; front, back, and sides if somebody is willing to do the favor. ",boardgames
2,1719882203.0,Clank Digital Beta Code,"I received a unique code to access the Clank Digital Beta via Steam; however, I’m not interested in playing it digitally.

If anyone would like it please send me a DM. 
First come, first served.",boardgames
3,1719881899.0,Identify the game from its rules/mechanics... in 15 words or less.,"How unique are our games' mechanisms really?

**Rules**

1. No more then 15 words.
2. No words, or derivations of words, from the title (ie for '**Mage Knight**, cannot use ""Mages"", ""magic"" or ""knightly"").
3. Must describe rules and mechanisms, not concepts or thematic goals (ie ""eliminate other players"" rather than ""conquer the galaxy"")
4. No in-game terminology (eg ""catapult"" movement from **Arcs** or ""Sponsors"" for **Ark Nova**)
4. No thematic or abstract descriptors - (eg ""woodland creatures"" for **Root** is not a rule or mechanism; ""hexes"" for **Castles of Burgundy** is not part of a rule or mechanism; ""ships"" from **Arcs** are just flavour for ""pieces"")

The challenge is to identify a game as closely as possible using only its mechanics, not to sneak in a word that gives away what the game is.

For example, **Castle of Burgundy** might be: ""*use dice to take tiles from center board and place onto your board*"".

**Ark Nova** might be: ""*juggle five different actions to fill your board and score on two separate point tracks*"".

How many games can we uniquely describe this way?",boardgames
4,1719877381.0,What are some spin off games you think are better than the original?,"I played Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition recently and thought it was way more fun than the original game. Same with Wyrmspan vs Wingspan, and I was curious if there were other games people liked more than the original.


Also: throw in 7 Wonders Architects over the original.",boardgames

6,1719875089.0,Game work ,"Ive got a job that allows me a few hours of gaming every day but im stuck in a bit of pickle of what to play. While my options arent super limited id prefer to it be on a handheld due to not having to bring my laptop on the bike. Which of these or similar suggestions would you all recommend? 

Mmo - wow (requires laptop) 

Strategy games - vandal hearts, Fire emblem (nintendo switch is easy to bring so big +) 

Cardgame - magic the gathering (played on phone but i get easily tilted during online play)

Boardgame - gloomhaven Buttons and bugs or suggestions (this particular game is not available but similar ones can be bought on switch or phone)

I prefer permanent progression so no roguelikes. Boardgames can potentially get away with it like spirit island but i prefer as little rng as possible. ",boardgames

9,1719871177.0,Any way to make Fog of Love less onerous to set up? ,"Hey all, just wanted to see if anyone has some kind of homebrew or hack that makes this game less of a slog. I love role play and I'd like to play this game more, but it is *daunting* just trying to set it up correctly, remember all the steps while trying to read the teeniest, tiniest print of the rules, etc. 

How can I make it something we can just jump right into?

12,1719868029.0,Good murder mystery party game for 25 people over a weekend,"There are so many of them I don't know which are best (night of mystery; mischief games, etc). I'm hosting a weekend for my 30th with 25 people, so it doesn't need to be played just over dinner. I'm looking for something where everyone has a role, but not too complicated and detailed that people lose track or get bored. It's not a particularly nerdy group so they won't go full character role play. 

Grateful for your suggestions :)",boardgames
13,1719867886.0,Protecting Game Boards? ,"I recently got my copy of 6:Siege from Kickstarter and have been trying to preserve and protect as much cardboard as I can. I'm a bit worried about the game boards lasting, they're double sided and would be very difficult or near impossible to replace a few years down the line.

Has anyone had luck protecting folding game boards? ",boardgames
14,1719867441.0,Game for 8-12 high school students,I’m looking for a game that 8-12 high school (9th - 12th grade) students with no knowledge of board games can start and finish in less than say 45 minutes (including teaching them the game). I’m actually looking to gradually introduce board games to them so they can play increasingly more difficult ones. But I need to start with easy fun ones. ,boardgames

19,1719858175.0,Oilman's Game Ruling,"My partner and I started playing The Oilman Game again now that our children are old enough to participate.
Given different rulings in the past from each side, we need help determining one solid ruling on successfully striking Level 3 Oil.

I've added 4 example photos, both drilling sticks used in each photo are L3. The discrepancy is the L3 sticks that go past the other sticks threshold but do not entirely reach the board. The argument is that there are ""2 different levels"" of blocks that would award an oil strike at L3. The other argument is that if it goes past the (roughly 1/2 inch) threshold with L3 stick it's as good as a miss and a purple should be placed in the hole, regardless of whether the head of the stick touches the board or not.

For those that have ever played this unique game, can you please share your experiences and decisions regarding our discrepancy and help us come to a definitive answer?",boardgames
20,1719858039.0,How many mistakes do you make per game?,In a mid weight game I generally make one mistake per game. Usually it's nothing serious but sometimes it could have influenced the outcome of the game. We just generally accept the situation and move on. My gf and I are still fairly new to board games but how often does it generally happen in the community that a mistake is made?,boardgames
21,1719855285.0,Marvel Selfish rule clarification ,"It seems that there's no interaction between players in this game. Yes, you can do things to other players but there's no method for other players to stop you doing the thing to them.

Or so I thought.

But I realise there are three cards called Block that say: ""Play this to block an attack. Then discard this card.""

""Great!"" I think. ""Let's see what exactly constitutes an attack.""

But... no cards nor the rules sheet state what an ""attack"" is.

This is really annoying so can anyone
(1) Clarify what an attack is? And
(2) Offer any reasoning or source to support the clarification?",boardgames
22,1719855123.0,Scoundrel and My Additions,"I’ve been playing a single player card game called Scoundrel (not mine) and I’ve been having a lot of fun with it. In the rules you’re supposed to remove the red face cards and aces. I put the King of Diamonds and King of Hearts back into the deck as “merchants.” When a king is in your dungeon and you decide to play it, you shuffle the discard pile and draw six cards. All spades and clubs are nothing cards, you can’t purchase them. All hearts you can get for free but they only heal three health, unless you draw a two of hearts in which case it’s three. All diamonds cost three of your health to purchase and your current weapon is discarded in place of the purchased weapon. If a red king or joker (the next card I added) is drawn, they are also nothing cards and can’t be purchased. You can only purchase/get one card from a merchant, so either a weapon or health. The next card I added was the jokers, which when drawn and played allow you to shuffle the dungeon deck. This could be useful because if you skip a very difficult dungeon and you know it’s coming but you draw a joker, that dungeon will be completely different. It could also create very difficult dungeons but it’s just chance. I also added a “looping” mechanic like in a real rogue-like. After you finish the dungeon, you mark that you’ve finished the dungeon somehow, you keep your current health and weapon, you shuffle the discard pile and make it the dungeon pile. The weapons in the merchant now cost three health instead of two and it increases every loop (probably maxing at five). I’m left with the red aces, queens, and jacks. For Jacks I was thinking of making them “Necromancers”, and when drawn and played you can pay him 1-2 of your health (haven’t decided) to shuffle the discard pile and play four cards, basically resurrecting a new dungeon from the already discarded cards. It’s like a dungeon within a dungeon. This could be useful because you could get really good weapons/health potions but you could also encounter powerful monsters. I wanted some opinions on what I should make the queen and aces and any additional rule ideas, or if I should modify and of my new rules. Thank you!",boardgames
23,1719854173.0,Deck building games for beginners,Recently I have seen a couple of YouTube videos showing deck builder games.

Does anybody have any recommendations for absolute beginners.,boardgames
24,1719851752.0,"Large scale, weekend long, hidden roles game","Hi All,

  
I'm not sure if this is the best sub for this or not but here we go. I am the director of a small youth camp that runs 3 times per year. The age range of the kids is 12-17 and we are expecting about 70 kids at our next camp. The camp is mostly outdoors and is on a large campground in the woods. I'm currently trying to design some kind of large scale, 3 full day, hidden roles game for the kids to participate in while at camp. Here are the criteria I'm looking for:

1. Fairly easy to understand

2. Can be played off and on throughout the day (there are a lot of other activities)

3. Engaging for everyone, even if you've been ""eliminated"" (i.e. You're the mafia and you get caught). So, some way to continue interacting with the game after elimination.

4. Some sort of satisfying conclusion at the end of the weekend

  
I know this is probably a tall order, but the kids would absolutely love it if we were able to come up with something like this. I tried a weekend long game in the past that the kids liked but I felt it didn't quite hit the mark. It involved paintball so this time I'm looking for something that is less intimidating for the kids to participate in. There's a description below of the game I made up for last time.

  
Thank you for your time and I'm excited to hear your ideas!

  
**Previous Year's Game:**

Throughout the weekend the kids would earn credits through challenges (like relays, scavenger hunts, etc.) and then on the last night they went on a ""mission"" in small teams to steal an item that was being guarded (by volunteer adults) with paintball guns. The kids used their credits to outfit themselves for the mission, they could buy smoke grenades, walkie-talkies, hire a mercenary (another adult who would do what they asked), and other stuff. The guards were playing like a simple AI, not really trying hard to catch all of the kids and walking in straight lines along defined patrol paths. But the kids thought the adults were going to try hard and unload on them so they basically ended up hiding in the bushes until time expired. From my perspective, it was a pretty big bummer but the kids still raved about it even though they didn't really do much on their missions.",boardgames
